i saw this movie in the theater and still do n't really know what it 's actually about . i have to say though , that if you rank this `` film '' as a comedy , then it deserves <NUM> stars , sadly , i 'm pretty certain that uwe boll did n't mean it as such ( though i 'm sure he would say otherwise ) . despite this movie being as bad as it is , i have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that i have ever had , the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad , that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in mystery science theater fashion . the movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like `` do n't be insane ! '' and virtually every word to come out of tara reid 's mouth , but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend marco and literally <NUM> people , including myself , could n't resist the urge to yell `` polo '' at the screen . this is one of those movies that 's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art ( if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is ) . it amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie , i ca n't think of a single use for it , though i can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in sadam huisein 's palace during operation iraqi freedom , then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction
the book is useful , but i had to keep putting it down out of frustration . many of the examples and images do n't match up with the text , it 's loaded with typos , and chapter <NUM> constantly references itself as chapter <NUM> . that 's as far as i 've gotten so far , because i * really * have to keep putting this book down out of frustration . let me be clear , i 'm not super-picky about typos and what not , but this book is ridiculous . a few hours of proof-reading is all that would have been needed . i 'm honestly amazed it was released like this . somebody needs to get fired over this . it 's that bad . and no , i 'm not exaggerating . as far as how useful the book is , you can pick it up and leaf through to find a solution to whatever problem you 're trying to solve . but if the solution you find is affected by one of the hundred or so typos and mistakes , you might be setting yourself up for a wild goose chase trying to figure out why your code does n't work like it does in the book . ask me how i know .. also , note that most of the positive reviews here refer to the 1st edition
the editor decided that i do n't want to see how the plane crashes into wtc , or how people jump from windows , so , he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else . instead , there is a plenty of news people 's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking ( and why do i care ? ) , plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left .
i 'm sure that many people like this movie . but if you are looking at the directors cut version and says jet li collection at the bottom , then the dvd does not play . i got this at cd tradepost for 1.99 and it shows why it is priced that low . this movie comes in a collection that i do n't know the title of but it comes with a jackie movie , and shaolin idiot . they come in a nice looking 5-disc boxed set and it looks very intrigueing because they have them all in dvd cases like this and you have never seen them before . shaolin idiot-look this movie up if you do n't believe me and you think that i just do n't like this and am telling you not to watch it because of that . like <NUM> people have written a review saying the dvd does n't work , that is called confirmation . and one of the reviewers made a comment that this is not shaolin idiot but another stephen chow movie that sucks and he must have just seen this , the only other thing that i can think of is that he has the one dvd player that these discs work on . i have <NUM> dvd players and tried this dvd on a total of <NUM> dvd players , all different and i got a disc error on all of them . so obviously they just do n't work so just do n't buy this . this movie actually works in the jet li collection for 11.99 that i reviewd on here , and it is the worst picture quality i have ever seen for a non old scool movie . the translation seriously can not be read at all ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! , the sound is horrible , and i could n't even tell what was going on when billy chow and jet li were fighting ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have plenty fo movies that come from a horrible film stock , but this competes with some of the all-time worst that i have ever seen . so i ca n't really recommend this either . this has got to be the only jet li movie i have n't seen that i have tried to find . i have his first <NUM> movies , but ca n't find jet li vs. billy chw part <NUM> . son of a mother f # & $ ^ % , piece of * / @ ! . if your eyes are already shot , then you may be able too watch this , but i challenge you to find a worse copy of any movie than what comes in the jet li collection .
i am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and i was incredibly disappointed by gigi . as if the overdone french accents are n't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced . the one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect , however for me that might have been the worst part . the songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head . the moral of this story is , spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on
<NUM> versions of the same song and amazon does n't have the <NUM> sec preview of any of them . sooo it 's an import ? ? ? where is the international version of the music video ?
for a penny less , you can get every song on `` feelin 's alright '' and eleven more songs from the compilation smiling phases . sure , this one disc compilation contains * great music * but what shmoe would buy it when you can get more music on 2-cds for less money ? ? ? ? perhaps another reviewer can fill me in on the `` logic '' of buying this over smiling phases because i do n't see it
anatomy reminded me of some of those european horror flicks of the seventies like twitch of the death nerve or suspiria . franka potente ( who gained american notice in the two bourne movies ) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the hippocratic oath . this society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who are n't dead ! the movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes , and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike . the identity of the villain ( s ) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity , it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending , and with sequel written all over it . ( anatomy <NUM> was made a couple years later ) . it 's comparable to our teen slashers , but because of the foreign aspects , it seems a little cheesier
james spader was supposed to be in the last season of diner . that would be my only reason for buying it . he is certainly not in this one ! so where is he ? ? ? ? ! ! ! are there no diner videos or dvds with james spader ?
i 'm a really big christina fan . hands down , she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there . this album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics . it would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role . although there are a couple of good tracks , the rest are filler . i was really disappointed with the outcome of this album .
as a fan of frederick buechner , i found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy , reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade . i found it disappointing , as he focuses on his collection of buechner family memoribilia . as hard as he tries to universalize it , making it accessible to all of us , for me , it just did n't work . and it reads like a review of one 's summer family reunion . sorry . read his other stuff . it 's great !
unfortunately for the morons who continue to churn out these silly little tracts ( i wo n't insult `` books '' by calling this that ) the only one of our `` founding fathers '' who ever wanted anything even resembling a christian nation ( the phrase he used was `` christian sparta '' ) was patrick henry , and he did n't even sign the constitution ! the other founders from jefferson to franklin were deists , freebelievers , agnostics , atheists , or at the very least non-comformists like george washington . who , despite `` belonging '' to a church requiring it ( martha 's ) , never took commmunion in his entire life . jefferson who rewrote the bible , editing out any of the magical `` donkey 's can talk , people can fly , and a man named jesus lives up in the sky '' nonsense so dear to christians , certainly was n't a xtian . adams said that the only thing that came out of religion and the state interacting was tyranny . geez kids i hate to burst you `` holier than thou '' bubble but america is n't a christian nation , has never been a christian nation , and as long as truely freedom-loving people have breath in their body will never be a christian nation
if you are expecting a sound from thom yorke as good as the band he fronts , you will be disappointed . i do not believe this album is close to the quality of any radiohead album . t.yorke is too experimental with his solo debut . i am not impressed . `` the erasure '' has glimpses of the brilliance of 'kid a ' and 'amnesiac ' but does n't come close to matching either of radiohead 's most recent releases .
i was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of ! it appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition . feel like i wasted my money here .
the first thing you should know about the hurricane is that it was based on two books , one of which ( the sixteenth round ) was written by rubin carter . the second thing you should know is that rubin carter is not a man of exemplary honesty . the third thing you should know is that the other book ( lazarus and the hurricane ) on which this movie was based was written by two of the canadians who bought into carter 's hokum , as have so many after them . i will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that carter makes in his book , since other posters here have already done a good job of that . instead , i 'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews . these are divided into three groups . the first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride . if you belong in this group , i do not fault you . hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public . but let me ask you this : if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title `` hero , '' would you still rate it highly ? if your answer is `` yes , '' then you belong in the second group , those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama , and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies . to this group , i have this to say : if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story , he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right . it 's called integrity , and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability . you say this is a dramatization and not a documentary ? well , even a dramatization should be done with some integrity . i can go along with some minor embellishments here and there , but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story , that , in my book , is unforgivable . and so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie 's dishonesty ? vested interest does not render their arguments invalid . finally , to the third group , those who actually believe that carter is in fact a martyr-scholar , i ask you to please open your eyes . there is absolutely no documentation to support carter 's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile , that he was a civil rights activist , that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory , and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image . on the other hand , there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man 's delusional fantasies . you say that cal deal , the man behind graphicwitness.com , is a racist ? please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html . also , know this : deal went into the rubin carter case actually believing that carter was innocent . it took just one interview for deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in carter 's statements . he went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed carter as a liar . many accounts today have it that carter is a changed man . i sincerely hope this is a real change , and not just a show . but whatever the case , the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash . i 'm not counting on that , though
okay , let me explain the title . i call this review happy birthday mom because in the middle of the movie i stopped the movie to call my mom and wish her a happy birthday . the typical thought would be that i bought this dvd for my mother as a birthday gift , but i do like my mom , so i would n't do that to her . later in the movie i also stopped it to talk to my friend that lives in canada . yeah , i stopped it to talk to a canadian , thats bad .... well he 's just up there for school , so ya know . some of it was good , but it could have done better . i have the seemingly harder to come by skill of seperating fiction ( movie , game , tv ) from real life , so i like the kind of shat that upsets fragile people without that skill . i 'm sure some of the violence in this movie made someone cry foul .... and its gets and extra half star simply because kari wuhrer is hot in this movie , like every movie she 's in !
nickel creek fans , obviously , will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band . presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate watkins ' chops as a picker , yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of nickel creek that it does n't do much to differentiate his work from theirs . the album opens with & quot ; neo 's song , & quot ; which sounds like a watered-down version of tony rice 's note-bending flatpicking style ; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and windham hill-ish . watkins has lots of technical facility , but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland
<NUM> bad movies on <NUM> dvd * * * yawn * * * nex
this was a bad movie , the acting was horrible , the dialogue was laughable , and some of the action sequences were ridiculous ! especially that one scene where they blantantly & quot ; borrow & quot ; scenes from terminator <NUM> . it 's insane they use scenes straight from the movie , from when they tried to break into cyberdyne systems . and they did n't even change that name they kept it , cyberdyne systems . it was a very sad thing to see
suzanne somers apparently has no use for modern medical science . especially as a survivor of breast cancer ( although of a very early stage ) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones . recent studies have shown that women who were taking hrt for protection from heart problems actually had more problems than normal menopausal women . this is an unbelievably destructive , horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously . being skinny is not more important than being alive . if you want to get the real scoop on hormones , talk to a doctor at an academic medical center ( in other words , one that is n't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain ) and see what she or he has to say . chances are excellent that you 'll be told to avoid them at all cost . look at it this way : are you going to put your very life in the hands of suzanne somers ? i 'm sure she 's a very nice person ; it 's just that she has no medical training whatsoever . * * * writing from an nci-designated comprehensive cancer center * *
wow ... i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe .... i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in <NUM> , but this is just overkill .... relient k , academy is , everytime i die , from first to last , underoath , matchbook romance , saves the day are reasons not to support this tour ( for all those people who go just to see nofx , casualties , and time again ) ... i really give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around ! this is worse than last year 's by far .... but what could you expect ? these tours over the past <NUM> years have been on a downfall ... i mean the bands that are good on this are n't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a <NUM> $ ticket to one of the shows . to me , that is a scam ... im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a `` punk '' tour ... i mean maybe if nofx gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids , then maybe even those guys can see what hell this `` nu-emo '' trend is . now , i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is , but i will say this .... fans of warped <NUM> and back ... steer clear .. this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands ( minus time again and casualties .. and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands ) .... some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit , but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe ( brainless ) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure . all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy , simple plan , yellowcard , blink <NUM> , good charlotte and new-school afi . bottom line ... avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better ! ...... most likely it 'll be worse , but hey , stranger things have happened
if you 'd like to lose your internet account , make lots of enemies , and generally prove to everyone that you have no conscience or morals , by all means follow the directions in this book . but do n't buy it . just stand in the bookstore and read it , if you absolutely feel the need to know what it 's abou
love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that does n't really have a point . it really seems to be just sam 's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup . there are some great anecdotes woven through the book ( and i 'm sure he has plenty that are n't shared ) . he goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic . at the end of the day i 'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly . it dose n't go into the brewing in any depth and there 's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book . if your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest
the reading was okay , but there was n't much meat to it . each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story . only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located . one of the most interesting pages told about how disney bought up all of the fl property using fictitious companies . for the price , i was disappointed as most of it is not notable . if you 're a disney buff , get this from the library and save the $ $ $ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting
i have cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history , which was not passed down in our family , so i got this book to read in good faith . the author makes us sound like a bunch of backward , bloodthirsty , superstitious people , and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous ( ... ) . there is little in the book of the trail of tears , and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author , who believes he can mind read for people dead over <NUM> years . when he does get around to the actual trail of tears ( the last sixth of the book ) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were , and gets into how not that many people really died , and the federal government is being portrayed in a bad light historically . he also portrays the cherokee nation 's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book , treating the cherokee as a quaint , dead culture and people . it saddens me that college students are being given this to read . i learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book
review by cory rennison : major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them . the kind folks over at maverick records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is stutterfly . stutterfly has thrown together <NUM> tracks of power chords , angst-ridden lyrics , and song titles that are laughable at best . some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals , and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords . there is n't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days , so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this cd , however instrumentally , there 's just nothing special here . with only a few key moments here and there , which are easily forgotten anyways , there 's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album . chances are i 'll forget this band 's name by next week
mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic . mcmurry 's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms , and other trivial components . the only reason you should buy this book ( same reason i did ) is if your o-chem course is based on this ; that being , this is your prescribed text . it is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook . however this may not be the case for this edition of mcmurry . organic chemistry by wade has the same chapter format , covers essentially the same thing but treats the fundamental principles with more depth ; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry . one thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for ir frequencies of major functional groups , and mass spectra is barely covered . it is at best just mentioned ... nothing more . wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth ... something which is essential in second year chemistry . all in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics . when it discuses kmno4 oxidatation , that at least should be a review of redox . the chapters on substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory , but it is the basics that are lacking . i would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult wade and compare it to the writing style of mcmurry . albeit mcmurry is very nice and colourful , you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry . the book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in australia , which suggests the severe lackings of this book . this has been inherent in it for the last three editions ... not too happy with it
while it seems to be the tendency of many cave fans to drool over anything the man records , this is not an album that is up to par with many of his other efforts . there are some stand out tracks such as `` deanna '' and `` mercy '' , but many of the rest come off as either overwrought or overly bombastic . obviously , if you 're already a fan , you 'll want this disc regardless , but to anyone new to nick cave 's work i recommend his `` best of '' collection or `` the boatman 's call ''
the first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline , so i wo n't go there . i 'll tackle the ending ... what ending ? i even backed it up to see what i missed . then , i went to the special features to see an alternate ending . it varied little from the shows ending . after investing the time to see this movie , i hated the ending . however , jacqueline bisset is still very lovely . adam garcia did n't too badly and i did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces ...
pls . rick nielsen , `` tell me everything '' ! why did you guys get a sorry producer like ted templeman to produce what could have been a great comeback lp ? if you trick fans wan na be in 'my gang ' then you got ta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the tricksters are gon na stay employed ! 'you 're all i wan na do ' and the title track , with it 's `` mommy and daddy '' chorus , is kinda cool and retro for 'surrender ' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks ! like cheap trick 's ca- reer after this disgrace ! it 's enough to make you 'cry baby ' ... pls . bring back brant !
first things firts ..... i am clueless as to why the reviews online for this book have stars enough to fill the sky . unless written by friends ( that too , the really good and loyal ones ) the book would not deserve even a <NUM> star . infact i looked for 1/2 a star and couldnt find one . the narration is plainly put , silly and yada yada . rambling without a direction and generous usage of indian words like chambu is totally uncalled for considering the that the target is a world audience . amulya should read and re re re read arundati roy 's god of small things to see how the soft balance between something indian yet talking crystal clear to the western soul is acheived . i read blurbs of the other books written by amulya and the narrative is as blah as it is in this one . i am not trying to be vicious here , but plain frank since the other reviews are so unreasonably off the target . a very boringly , tedious , soporiphic rambling of a book . i would not recommend this to any one
i 'm sure this wo n't win me any popular votes but , this musical is one that i feel i have to comment on . what has happened to broadway ? why has london 's west end taking over the musical theatre industry ? well , when broadway produces musicals such as `` little women . '' as a fan of the book i had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as `` the secret garden '' or `` jane eyre . '' but , this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage . the songs are mindless garbage with no feeling , depth , or emotion and listening to the cd is what one broadway fan might consider torture . there are a few exceptions `` take a chance on me '' and `` small umbrella in the rain '' somehow manage to stand out but , are not enough to save this show from a slow death on broadway . the cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play ... susan foster who is well known as millie does a decent job as joe but , misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character joe . danny gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a tony nomination ... i can only hope he makes a few cds after this show . it 's obvious why when you listen to `` little women '' - how it came to die slowly and painfully on broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story ... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss . made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck . but , i will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy . all in all broadway needs something more and fans need something else ..
myth # <NUM> : american women live under patriarchy myth # <NUM> : america 's the world 's leading threat to the environment myth # <NUM> : america is a racist nation myth # <NUM> : the untied states is an imperial power . myth # <NUM> : the rich get richer , the poor get poorer all facts . plus , the higher the iq the more liberal someone is . ben franklin , einstein , our founding forefathers like thomas jefferson ... all liberals . the lower the iq the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself . i love america , but changes need to be made . rome fell too eventually from bad politics
setzer and his band are sizzlin ' hot , and he is my favorite swing band leader , however no matter how many times i try to listen to this cd , i just ca n't bring myself to like it . it is just too darn hokey , cheezy , commercial , and corny . in the mood is full of energy , and could have been great without the `` dj mix '' club beat intro , and i find the rapping offensive racially . it sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere , and mocking the race . setzer 's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great , and band is smokin . the sonsg americano sucks , and the production value in nill , zero , nana , it 's way overproduced . buy hsi new live <NUM> cd set instead ..
i love trance music , that style of dance music with fast , continuous beats and rich electronic sounds , and often sweet sounding vocals , usually female vocals . so i thought i 'd like this album . well , i do like it musically . it 's not great , but it 's good trance music . but the lyrics ruin the album for me . most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out . here are lyrical samples from the cd : `` maybe you 're better off without me . '' `` i 'm wide awake , it 's time to make it on my own ; the dream is over . '' `` we wanted love to last forever , but something 's missing ... i ca n't find words to break your fall , when 'goodbye ' says it all . '' `` it gets lonely , but i have no other choice ... no one sees my dreams falling all apart ... i 've been blinded by your lies . i never knew love could be so wrong . '' `` tell me why you ca n't feel the things i do ... i made the same mistakes i know i 'll make again ... it meant nothing to you , you 'll never understand , it meant nothing to you , the touch of my hand . '' `` november 's here again , raining down on me , i disappear again ... '' `` it seems like every [ scrub ? ] i see is trying to get it on with me , they think it impresses me , the way they act so foolishly ... i do n't care , i never liked you anyway ... you 're a total waste of time . '' if these lyrics fit your life , and you like trance music , you 'll probably like this album . i do like the remake of a-ha 's `` the sun always shines on tv . '' it 's not better than a-ha 's 8-minute remix version , but it 's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor . this album has three mixes of the song , none of them significantly different from the other . i also like the instrumental track , `` blown away . '' these tracks are enjoyable , and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics , but the album as a whole i find too depressing
no serious economist would take such a proposal , well , seriously . in short , murray 's argument is foolish . inflation would eat up the redistributed $ 10,000 , and , unless the `` gift '' money were indexed to inflation , that $ 10,000 would be worth about $ <NUM> in a couple of years . inflation would come in many forms : higher rents , higher food and fuel bills , etc . for example , an important reason for a food stamp being a food stamp is not just to ensure that the money is spent on food , but also to ensure that more paper money is n't loosed upon the economy causing unforeseen inflationary pressures . food stamps do not cause inflation ; murray 's program most certainly would . buy the book if you want , but be sure to brush up on your economics as you read this absolute and utter nonsense .
i love her relaxed phrasing and the tone and easy flow of her vocal
the review title says it all ....
believe it or not , i actually wanted to watch this movie . i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts . ( i watched _jacob 's ladder_ because i remembered an intriguing preview on a vhs cassette i watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _silent hill_ sealed the deal ; my girlfriend owns a copy of lyne 's version of _lolita_ ; _fatal attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental ; i watched the tv version of _indecent proposal_ ; i have n't seen _9 1/2 weeks_ but i read the book . ) flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you 've never seen it . and i always wanted to hear the song `` maniac '' in its original context , so when i found it on an acquaintances shelf i popped it in . so , how was it ? not too bad . not great by any means , or even really that good ( _lolita_ and _jacob 's ladder_ are both quite good ) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work . the plot is a by-the-book `` believe in your dreams '' story with really lame dialog , but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like i was watching an abstract silent film . i do n't know squat about dancing , but the choreography seemed innovative , at least for its time . i ca n't even remember the names of the characters , but all in all , i have to admit that it was kind of neat . also , if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind , _flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from hollywood : it 's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials , one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack joe esterhasz and was produced by jerry bruckheimer ! taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about <NUM> % of all crap movies made since
all of the songs except for one are trash on this one . not worth forking over even $ .01 for this one ! ! !
rising sun was a terrible read . crichton uses one device throughout : the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him . it 's tiring and monotonous . never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between american and japanese business cultures .
i am baffled at how country music stations and fans of the horrible music can stand hearing lonestar 's `` mr . mom '' over and over again everyday . the song is as stupid as it is annoying , and the lyircs are extremely juvenile . who had the horrible idea of writing a song about stay at home mothers ? lonestar , the manwomen of country . but what 's worse is that nashville and country radio declared it a hit and decided to play it <NUM> times per day . ( and i thought that tim mcgraw 's `` back when '' was as bad as it could get ) let 's take a look at a few of the hillariously idiotic lyrics from this song : `` football , soccer and ballet squeeze in scouts and pta and there 's that shopping list she left that 's seven pages long how much smoke can one stove make the kids wo n't eat my charcoal cake it 's more than any maid can take being mr . mom well pampers melt in a maytag dryer crayons go up one drawer higher rewind barney for the fifteenth time breakfast , six naps at nine there 's bubble gum in the baby 's hair sweet potatoes ( they pronounce it per-tat-ers ) in my lazy chair been crazy all day long and it 's only monday mr . mom '' i should seriously consider becoming a country artist . i can make my voice sound like a male country singer and i can write meaningless whitetrash songs , so all i have to do now is find someone to play steel guitar for me , and i 'm gon na make it big as a star in nashville and all over redneck usa . if you want to hear good country , stay with classics like johnny cash and conway twitty . please pass on girly garbage and mindless hick mumbling
this rates as one of the poorer mysteries i have read in years . it was truly an ordeal to finish , and i am left wondering why i bothered . it has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters , many of whom are stereotypical creations of little or no interest . i was particularly amused when the detective was told to & quot ; make a few inquiries at the transsexual shoe shop , giving the size and style of the shoe from the corpse & quot ; . in all of la , i am sure there is just one known & quot ; transsexual shoe shop & quot ; . please . i suspect ms. laplante has better material , but this is a poor example better left unread . i would give it less than one star , but unfortunately that 's not an option
the answer is a big no ! after the first <NUM> minutes of this movie , which do n't get me wrong were quite awesome , the movie completely tanks at all levels . the movie was set in a mall , but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival , no ! i read an interview with the director of this movie , and when asked about setting the movie in a mall , the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine . now look , when you 're using the title , `` dawn of the dead '' , you better remake it great , i mean really great . the followers of romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the gp . you know , i might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different . definately not when the same . if you want to see really good zombie movies , watch the original romero trilogy , <NUM> days later , the lucio fulci trilogy , or even the return of the living dead . heck , even the resident evil movies easily out did this stinker . do n't waste your time or money
this book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from computer telephony magazine , without much editing or organization . it lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information , e.g. , its index is essentially a word occurance listing
as the title suggests , this is a book about improving your speed . it is a general book applicable to any sport . and so the authors go to great lengths to generalize their program . i expected to read about the latest in exercise physiology concerning speed , recommended training , and exercises . we do get that sort of thing in a manner of speaking , but to put it very bluntly , this book is one of the most jumbled , mixed up , illogical presentations you are likely to read . hard to believe three college graduates put this together . in order to get anything out of this book you kind of have to trudge all the way through it and improvise your thought process as you go . the authors give absolutely zero help . do we get titles to the latest studies on sport speed -- in the negative . do we get information on the latest persons doing research on the subject -- in the negative . do we get a logical , understandable training program -- in the negative . what we get instead is kind of a hodge podge of information coming from all directions without hardly any logical organized presentation . oh -- there is the seven step speed training program presented in <NUM> different chapters . and to give credit -- it does look like this is a good speed improvement program . however the information the seven chapters ( and you have to get through <NUM> almost imconprehensible chapters to get to the program ) seems to rain down from the sky in a very disconnected fashion . there are few explanations of the whys and wherefores ; there are zero explanations on where the program comes from or how it was put together , or where it fits in anywhere in what is being done by any one . it is just there , presented , and i suppose we are supposed to swallow it all on faith . there are presented many descriptions and photographs of useful looking exercises . i do know more about speed improvement after reading the book . but the information was gotten by pulling teeth
i 'm a big george strait fan and was disappointed by this album . this is not as upbeat as some of his other works , which would not be a problem if the slower pieces matched up well against classics like ' i can still make cheyenne . ' sadly , they do n't . moreover , even some of the upbeat works on this cd were not up to the high standards that strait has set for himself . the end result is a cd with a couple of good songs and a lot of chaff . this cd starts off strongly enough , with a piece called 'if the whole world was a honky tonk ; ' this is upbeat and well written ( strait did not write any of the pieces on this album ) . however , the album then starts swinging wildly between some outstanding pieces such as 'texas , ' strait 's cover of merle haggard 's 'the seashores of old mexico ' and the hit 'she let herself go ' and some substandard pieces such as 'oh , what a perfect day , ' the upbeat but uninspired 'high tone woman ' and the disappointing title track . by far the worst piece on this cd is 'good news , bad news , ' a duet between strait and lee ann womack . this is a long piece that has clearly been designed to show off womack 's vocal range . the song feels like it 's missing a verse and like strait really is just along for the ride . this is a cd that i would only recommend for die-hard strait fans . there is not enough solid material for the casual fan or for a true twang aficionado to bother purchasing this instead of waiting for the best pieces to show up on a later greatest hits compilation
this book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that i have ever read . the most glaring flaw is that the last approximately <NUM> pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book . since the book is only <NUM> pages long , this is quite a tangent for the author to take . within this section , the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years . i would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school . past this , the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development . many new characters and conflicts are introduced , only to disappear in the next chapter . the main character never develops , and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles . the book simply does not have redeeming qualities , and even takes a few moments to trash ayn rand ; since this is a book that young adults will probably read , it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author , controversial as she is . i was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the pen/faulkner award . i strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material . <NUM> stars
the break up is a an annoying film that presents a couple on the brink of all- out personal warfare over a relationship gone bad . this movie features plenty of yelling , deceitfulness , game playing , and other things that are common when a relationship has reached its final hours . i can remember when this film was first released and it seemed intriguing . based on the advertisements for the film , it looked like it would be an entertaining romantic comedy . it fact , it is neither romantic nor funny . there are dashes of humor at the beginning of the film but little else . the movie is mostly serious all the way with vaughn and aniston arguing almost non- stop until the very end of the film when they become civil once more . vaughn and aniston were known to be personally involved with each other during the time this movie was being filmed and this fact gave me the impression that the movie would offer great chemistry and passion . but vaughn and aniston do not seem right in this movie . they do n't seem like a likely couple and many film critics have correctly pointed out that the two were not very good together in this film . what really bothered me most with this movie is how irritated i felt as i watched ! vaughn and aniston continuously trade barbs with each other and vaughn acts impatient and irritating even when he is with friends . watching the film actually elevated my blood pressure and raised my stress level . i watched it with the hope of viewing a lightened up comedy that would serve as a good after- work stress reliever . instead , i felt the urge to blow off steam when the movie was finally over . this drama might be the type that some bickering couples can relate to but not only could i not relate , my tolerance for this film continued to decline with each minute . i just wanted it to end to put me out of my misery . there are a few redeeming qualities with this movie , like the individual performances by the various cast members . but the main problem with the acting is that the performers and performances do n't seem to gel . the characters are fine on their own , but they do n't have the on- screen chemistry so desperately needed to make this film work . it all ads up to a frustrating film that should be avoided .
as someone who was certainly an undergraduate when sacks was teaching and who has taught both high school and college , i have to say that i found the book to be quite laughable . the entire book seems to come down to , `` these damn kids today ! boy , when i was a kid ... '' and resembles little more than one of grandpa simpson 's long meandering stories . ( * gasp ! * a reference to popular culture , oh no ! ) sacks never had any teaching experience nor training and was somehow suprized to learn that he was horrible at teaching . what ? you mean to do something well you might need to learn about it and have some experience doing it ? ? ? this is , of course , ironic because sacks was teaching classes on journalism and constantly critiques his students who ignore his journalistic experience and yet throughout the book he ignores and mocks the advice of teachers who have teaching experience . dear kettle , you are black . sincerely , the pot . throughout the book he makes constant references to kids who wear baseball hats in class , sloutch , and have piercings as if someone 's appearance is indicative of their worth or ability . i 'm sure he would have a heart attack if he walked into my classroom and saw me teaching with a baseball hat on . all of his critiques would be fine if only he had done one thing : research . he constantly compares his experiences as a teacher in the 90s with his own experiences as a student decades before . however , all he offers is anecdotal evidence based on his own memories when comparing students then and in the 90s . if he had taken a minute to get down off of his high horse he might have went and talked to some teachers who had been around for decades and asked them their thoughts on students , or even better , go hunt down his college professors and ask them about classes in which he was a student . however , rather than go out and do some good investigative reporting and gather all the facts , he chose to write a poorly informed book-length letter to the editor about those damn kids who keep walking on his lawn . this book is a missed opportunity to have a real look at students in colleges . it is a shame that someone with no teaching experience and such an inflated self of self-importance ( the very things he chastises his students for ) chose to think that he was qualified to write it .
completely disappointed . no soul , no tradition . save your money unless you 're into ub40 and synthesized reggae ... ugh . it is all to obvious why there are no samples of this cd on the web page . i took one for the team ... buyer beware . support local music
okay , some of this is awesome : the ballads ai n't gone 'n ' give up on love and life without you are the best ; change it is a great blues-rocker , and his guitar livens up even weaker material like say what ! and come on , pt . <NUM> . still , this is a thin album overall . lookin ' out the window ; look at little sister ; you 'll be mine and empty arms are among stevie 's worst . stick to the first two records instead , plus maybe in step .
saw the previews of the first movie , but i was n't expecting too much from that . i tried to finish both the first and the second , but that did n't work out too well ... i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end . i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie , and that includes the first . all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it ... y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv . after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
grits are at their best when the underlying foundation of a song is a strong ( catchy ) melody . witness `` they all fall down , '' and `` here we go . '' on `` redemption , '' coffee and bone seemed to have abandoned their original purpose of making the most innovative hip-hop in the industry and have made an album that merely bites what is on the playlist of any top <NUM> rap station in the country . under the guidance of the production team of otto price and ric robbins , collectively known as incorporated elements , grits made their most memorable hits : all of which followed the above-mentioned formula . now these <NUM> albums , made after their departure/dismissal , have exposed bone and cof 's greatest weakness : the inability to make compelling beats . - fyi : pigeon john makes `` open bar '' the strongest track .
in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism . these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , `` cultural , '' religious , nationalistic , etc. , depending on where you look . on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups ; on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace . example : the turks and the armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ( `` jihad '' is barber 's label for this ) ; yet they see the same pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local pepsi bottling plants ( `` mcworld '' is barber 's label for this ) . that 's the book . this might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious . outside of that , it would take an observer from another planet to find this book 's insights novel or pointed . if you 're new to planet earth , by all means pick up a copy . it will catch you up on a few useful truisms . as others have pointed out , the `` terrorism 's challenge to democracy '' subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11 , but does n't accurately reflect the book 's content . `` jihad '' is deployed as a synecdoche in this book ; muslim extremism is just one of the book 's many examples of parochialism
a dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the us and abroad . i was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting . i enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen , but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target , i think it 's just a shame . the whole cast was pretty much of latin america origin , but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight . the plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many .
has some good topics discussed . would not recommend this book as a starter in labor law
one weak night ! ... zero stars if that was available . i never realized bon jovi was this bad a live band . they obviously get a lot of production help in the studio because this album ( several different concerts in several different venues ) is all bad . sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it
i bought `` old school - vol . <NUM> '' specifically to get the full-length version of dazz by brick , among other songs . i was disappointed and angry that it was the <NUM> min . radio version . after reading your reviews here , i 'm glad i did n't choose to get the best of brick . though i enjoy other songs by brick , dazz is my all-time favorite . today i found the long version on the `` disco super hits '' cd . though i 'm not crazy about other songs on this cd it 's worth the money . i will be playing my dazz over and over with my sun-roof open , a smile on my face , and the wind blowing free in my hair ! : -
the dvd does not work in ireland so it is absolutely useless ! ! i should have been made aware of this when i was purchasing the product . i would like to be refunded in full for the three dvds i have purchased : my fair lady , paris when it sizzles and breakfast at tiffanys ( purchased at the same time ) also the packaging costs were not displayed until i had entered my credit card number and were much too expensive . overall i am extremely disappointed with my experience and i expect to be compensated for this
the only reason why i watch this video is because hunk model tony ward stars in it . tony ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in madonna 's controversial justify my love video . since then i have not been able to get studly tony ward out of my mind . he is the only reason for watching this film . other than that the film is not worth anything , unless you are really into all that street hustling of hollywood . i warn you that this film is not very good . direction is bad , picture is n't that good , low budget , mediocre plot , and extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film . the only saving grace of the film is the hunkster tony ward . if you want tony , then this is a good film to see all of him . otherwise , discard the rest of the film . this film is really not suitable for people of any age
my <NUM> month old loves it - it 's junk , the production quality is weak , and the `` story '' is lame but my kid loves it . i think it was a great value given how many times he 's watched it
i bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new method dvd . i like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser . i did it once , did n't sweat and was bored ! it has been gathering dust ever since .
i do n't listen to the radio much . in fact , it would be closer to the truth to say that i actively avoid listening to the radio , whenever possible . but it seems that no matter where i go , i ca n't escape the constant airplay of green day 's megahit `` boulevard of broken dreams . '' i do n't hate this song because it has a bland , repetitive structure , or because of the band 's lackluster musical talents , or billie joe 's grating vocals . those are all valid reasons to hate `` boulevard of broken dreams '' but my reason is my own : the lyrical content . let 's take a look , shall we ? `` i walk a lonely road the only one that i have ever known '' yeah , sure , whatever you say . not only does billie joe have a wife of nearly twelve years , he also has numerous friends and millions of adoring fans throughout the world and was voted `` sexiest rock star '' by kerrang ! , and suddenly he 's telling me how lonely he is ? he 's probably never experienced one moment of true loneliness in his whole life ! what kind of hypocrisy is this ? the whole song is nothing but billie joe whining about how he walks alone and how he wishes `` someone out there will find me '' which comes out painfully contrived and insincere . `` oh , you 're overreacting , '' you say . well , maybe i am . but the truth is , i am violently sick of bands churning out shallow , meaningless drivel with some mopey lyrics to try to make money off of people 's misery ; and it 's not just green day , either . bands like linkin park , evanescence , good charlotte , simple plan , and many others all seem to be hooked on trying to parlay their so-called `` loneliness '' into their albums not because they really feel such emotions and wish to honestly express them , but because it sells albums . misery is n't trendy . songs like this and countless others aim for your pocketbook by pretending to `` feel your pain . '' these hacks are n't worth a dime
first off ... the pink spiders are in no way punk . secondly , this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it . third , the whole `` pink '' gimmick can only take you so far ... even pink had to change her hair color . i guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited , but for me it just makes me ill
i was super excited when i bought joann rosario 's first cd `` more , more , more . '' every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship . i was just as thrilled when i found out she had a new release , `` now more than ever ... worship . '' i heard one of her singles , `` god '' and figured i had to buy the cd when it came out . but boy was i disappointed when i popped it in my cd player ! ! ! the only stand out tracks are : track <NUM> : thanks be unto god track <NUM> : i hear you say track <NUM> : god the bonus track : cuando reposo en ti all of the other tracks are barely mediocre . it was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight . i am extremely upset that i wasted $ <NUM> on this piece of junk . i thought some worship music would be on here , since the title of the cd is `` worship , '' but do n't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face . she should 've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music . joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump . i highly doubt that i 'd buy anything else she sings . what was fred hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent ? it 's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd . the entire cd lacks the anointing . even the bonus video clip on the installed media player , that features joann and donnie mcclurkin sucks . all she does is add libs in spanish , plays some maracas , some castanets and god knows what else and i 'm supposed to bust a move to this ? ! no way ! ! ! two thumbs way , way down ! ! ! a feeble effort by joann . this will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth , as it did mine .
one hell of a waste of money ! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like i was , you are in for a hell of a disappointment ! the only reason why i think the first one was bad ass is cause vin diesel was in it , and yeah it was totally bad ass ! i 'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed , in this movie you get two real cars this time , a <NUM> camaro ss , and a <NUM> dodge challenger r/t and they both get destroyed ! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars ! god all mighty ! do n't waste your money on this movie , i would n't take this disappointment if it was given to me ! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie , buy frost bite ! you wo n't be disappointed
if you are looking for a d.i.y . book on silk screening look elsewhere . this is more of a historical review of the process . the book was copywritten in the '60 's so there is n't any & quot ; new technology & quot ; in the content
i love this movie i 've seen it probably more than <NUM> times ! so imagine how excited i was to see it for like <NUM> bucks at wal-mart .... this particular copy is sitting next to me right now and all can say is i was really mad when i sat and watched it , the editing is horrible there are times when the camera zooms on people it should n't , lines are cut out and sometimes there are voices but no one 's lips are moving . buy the authorized version not this one this one sucks
i like listening to george michael as i personally feel he has a great voice but this album is not really for me . i like almost all of his music but i could have skipped this one and it would not have been a loss
i wanted to find out about modern plumbing ( like pex ) and what kind of tools , code changes , etc . that are necessary for installing pex plumbing . not in this book . that information must have fallen through the cracks ( no plumber joke intended ) . author is stuck in the past . needs to be updated , revised , or recycled . kind of a bummer . now i have a book that i ca n't use . sweating copper ... come on now . the rest of us have made it to the 21st century
great expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written . i 'm no dickens ' expert , but i do know a little about literature- i do n't know how this even passed through the editing stage . it is slow-paced , boring , pointless , and an all-out waste of time to read . i have read challenging books with strong points like this before , and have sometimes enjoyed them , but never have i read a book this pointless and difficult to read , with such a stupid ending . dont waste your money and valuable time on it ! ! ! ! ! !
for an incredibly amazing , hilarious show , it is a shame that something that is normally closed-captioned when aired on television is not really captioned when released to dvd . amazon says it is closed captioned , but there is nothing on the dvd box that indicates it is . using this information , i went ahead and purchased it anyway , only to find out it was not at all . who is really at fault i do n't know , and yes i am definately bitter
although the work depicted in the photos is incredible , none of it is very useful . nice to look at - not at all practical for everyday painters
i love the a-team , but this box set left me disappointed . the description stating dolby digital 2.0 for the audio track is misleading since the audio is in mono , not stereo . i was also hoping there would be `` some '' extras in the set in addition to just the episodes
west is without a doubt a superb writer , however i found the shoes of the fisherman to be a great dissapointment . in spite of the fact that most of the reviews i have read higly praise the book , it never really got to me . the concept seems quite interesting at first : an unknown russian , cardinal kiril lakota is elected pope . after being held prisioner for quite a few years , he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity . at the same time , kamanev , the man who had been lakota 's prision guard in russia , and who tortured him beyond belief , has become the head of the russian government . the fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot , which in my opinion is never fully developed . the main issue i have with the novel is that it is plotless ... nothing really happens . a large portion of the book consists of a series of endless , and a bit boring , thoughts from lakota . on the other hand , the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks , which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader . there are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what lakota has to face as a pope , regading human cruelty , poverty , and most of all politics , which could have proven to be enough for a good novel . unfortunatelly , the narration goes astray in many parts , which lessens one 's interest in the book . quite frankly , i had to make a great effort to finish the book , hoping that at some time it would pick up , which it never did . as i mentioned before , west is a very good writer , but this book is in my opinion , highly overrated . i can honestly say it never got my full atention .
i do n't claim to be near as knowledgeable as the author , but this book rambled forever and i do n't feel it ever addressed the issue raised in its title . i got nothing out of it . probably just over my head
add me to the folks who thought this would continue the storyline and were disappointed . there 's really no reason to get this one unless you just want to own them all . all of the footage is cut from older episodes with a few extra bits of dialogue added . wish i 'd checked for reviews before picking it up .
i like atl i think there album uncle samz curze is a underated classic . but legendz ? ? ? ? not a classic , not even mediocre , da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired . this only getz <NUM> starz cuz of da song adventurez of ... easily the bezt cut on here , and one of da bezt of dere career . if u truly love atl cop this , if u dont , find a way to get adventurez of ... and leave this alone
mens , wat zingt deze sufgeneukte parkiet vals . negeren ! probeer eens echte muziek
i originally purchased the set upon it 's original release in <NUM> , over the years i have listened to it may times , continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time ... always concluding that the tracks ( especially disc <NUM> , disc <NUM> kicks in with `` him or me '' ) sounded like they came directly from vinyl , i have today just received the sundazed midnight ride . let me tell you if you love this stuff as i do , and want to hear the raiders , pass on this collection , and get the sundazed , the sound blows `` legend '' out the door ! i ca n't wait to get the rest on sun .
while there are those who would give this <NUM> stars even if it featured nothing but dancing elephants , those with any amount of knowledge of the present state of scholarship will find these essays somewhere in the range of speculative-outdated-appalling . cavin -- the man who invented the `` jesus had an evil twin who faked the resurrection '' theory -- makes for an intro that may as well have come from acharya s. martin and drange need an education in how an honor and shame society worked . derrett ? i wonder how he gets away with an argument that amounts to racial stereotyping ( `` jews are good with money '' ) in this day and age . carrier does the watusi to get out of the consensus on the meaning and understanding of resurrection . you know me , then you know where to go
this is the best cd in my exhausted collection since gong deaf three years ago . my other favorites are & quot ; walking in the wind & quot ; by marcel marso , & quot ; dancing in the dark & quot ; by helen keller , and the sound track of & quot ; finding our way on stage & quot ; , the concert featuring ray charles , stevie wonder , ronnie milsap , george sheering , diane shure , jose feliciano and dan quayle
yup , not to marginalize the other people who made the show great , but that 's basically what it boils down to . when i saw none of these people in the opening credits , i was concerned . the people who did make this movie , however , confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film , if not just plain sucky . i mean seriously , this would n't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show , let a lone a film . in one of the extras , the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a `` fun '' film and that they finished the script in no time at all . guess what , it shows . that is except for the fun part , but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent . the plot is extremely cliched and stupid . maybe if any of the <NUM> girls were interesting at all , it would 've been passable . however , we ended up with an extremely annoying , rebeling daddy 's girl who looks like a hale berry clone , a renee montoya clone , and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend . yeah , why should i give a crap about any of these chicks ? in the extras they said they did n't want to do something definitive with batwoman , but i call it laziness and lack of effort . if batwoman 's secret identity was one good character it might have worked , but instead we get three worthless ones . i was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after i heard the idea to bring batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie . however , any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent . i did like the fact that they continued the barbara/bruce text , but it was only in one short scene . i guess having batgirl and batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason i ca n't comprehend . the music to this movie is n't that great as everyone else said , especially compared to shirley walker 's beyond amazing score . however , i disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good . it looked like low-budget , digitally colored , corny crap to me . definitely no where even close to the amazing , noir-influced film making from the tv show . i was also a fan of penguin 's voice in the show , but here he 's played by the mad hatter 's voice actor instead . i do n't know if penguin 's voice acotr died or that he was just busy , but penguin just was n't the same this way . oever all , i ca n't find much to like in this film . i did find the inclusion of fan-service including batwoman 's costume a nice gesture , but definitely not enough to save this film . so yeah , only get this if you 're a completest . if you 're just starting to buy batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead . every episode is much more enjoyable than this half-baked movie
first off , i grew up with dogs , i have an affection for dogs . i even have respect for peta and their effort to ethically treat animals . that 's a good mission to have . but , that is a message that does not play well as this <NUM> minute movie . i mean with quotes like this `` maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature . '' just went too far for me . this movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay . the musical score was fine enough as was the melody . if you want a better dog movie , go get something like old yeller or where the red fern grows . both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion . this movie is literally for the dogs
this guy is hyped by dg to gain entracne into chinese market . either he does not know the reportoir , or he is faking . i give minus five , that is -5 , for listening experience and -100 for spending money . stay away from this dude . dg is trying to make money of a bogus guy . sound is no good when playing by cso under outgoing barenboim is worthless
`` deception '' is the edited version of `` ruby cairo , '' which is not a great movie but which is better than this one . it is n't just the sex scene that was edited out , but a total of about <NUM> minutes . the movie makes more sense in the rc version , and the sex scene , though dark and in andie 's case a bit airbrushed , is worth seeing , especially if you are a viggo mortensen fan . i do n't think it was the nudity andie objected to , though , or not entirely . the scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman . it effectively lets you know what the man 's character is really thinking , but it 's brutal in a subtle way . there is also , of course , the ( apparent ) age difference between the two characters . he looks about <NUM> years younger than she does , even with a beard
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies . gee , another movie with a fast-talking , potty-mouthed , black guy ( hello eddie murphy ) who , because it 's perfectly fine in ultra-lib , pc hollyweird , calls charlie sheen ( and everyone else who is not black ) a host of nasty , racially-oriented names . the movie is a mess . let 's see . the protagonist ( tucker ) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer , is chased around by cops and the bad guys . the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds . sheen is supposed to be a co-star , but like most of his other movies , he sleepwalks through it . clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker . the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along . first `` screenwriter '' : '' hey bob , what will we have tucker do next ? hey i know , let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second `` screenwriter '' `` hey , great idea fred , i sure do n't have any ideas '' . apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of murphy the trickster flicks . basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name . if that 's your idea of humor , i pity you .
review title says it all ! if you 've read any of her other stuff , this will be totally boring . she has explained most of the chakra stuff in her other books . if i had to read anyone else 's chakra-related story , i was gon na scream ! ! ca n't think of any reason to purchase or read this one
while the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded , there are way too many birds around . the cd describes their sound as distant and faint , but that 's far from accurate . the parts of the cd where all you hear is the stream alone do n't add up to more than <NUM> minutes , and never last more than a minute . for the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds , rather close and sometimes very loud . buyer beware : the <NUM> second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all ! very misleading
... now how do you start a review of this kind of movie . was it a movie ? when all of a dozen towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the ( wonderfully computer rendered ) dragons does n't that just somehow seem sad . we six heros will die so that the dragons wo n't eat the rest of you ! thats right all <NUM> of ... oh im sorry did n't see you there , all twelve of you . i especially like how in this town of twelve+heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy , a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels , ( talk about envy ) and the robin hood guy , except he 's actually from outside the town . so i 'm going to stop now before i cry ... yes it was that bad . but as always watch it for the heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing .. experience thing
i ca n't understand how this book won the world fantasy award . touted as `` horror '' , it was barely scary . lieber filled his book with a string of impossible coincidences , then pulled a rabbit out of his hat at the end . avoid
the who do n't have any talent . they are overrated , and only made <NUM> decent song in wont get fooled again . avoid this lousy compilation and get dire straits making movies insted
i do not quite understand why this should be a recommended buk-book . it is a fairly interesting interview , alright . but if you 're going to spend money on bukowski : buy his books . and if you want biographical information , go with howard sounes . to get a real good look on bukowski you also might want to check out the 'bukowski-tapes ' - film-interviews by barbet schroeder . pivano 's interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money
i dont see what people like about this cd . my <NUM> month old son and i looked at each other in disgust when i first played it ! ! ! very irritaing cd dont buy it ! ! ! i am returning it today .
intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new `` web 2.0 '' universe , i was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis . from the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis ( that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group ) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author 's argument . the book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance . i would qualify it as a light business read , entertaining but not quite convincing if you 're not part of the choir
i am wondering when this plague will be over .... and when we 'll be set free to listen to real music ... we all are so tired of her
this once promising and enjoyable series ( and i have read every book ) has just become too much like an overblown tv soap opera . every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up , it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it 's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode . temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two m 's but we all know that 's only a deception . the one bright spot in the story ( and earlier books had a whole lot more of them ) is on page <NUM> and involves the wonderful fontana brothers doing a james bond imitation . it took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last midnight louie story until the end . and i must say it 's a shocker and i will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches `` z ''
slow , dull and done on the `` cheap '' .... stick with `` zulu '' and read your history book 's .... far more entertaining
the book is written with the purpose to be an `` up-to-date [ source about ] dc/dc converters for students and practicing professionals '' . it is a shame how this target is not reached . since from the very begin , the introduction , you will face an answer : what is its usefulness ? you 'll hope that , going on reading , everything will be clearer , and , from a certain point of view , this is what you get : what you 've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students . however the text neither is `` practical '' nor gives you the `` in-depth-analysis '' you were hoping since its title begins with `` advanced '' . schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed . mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs . apart from this it is a good effort . in my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition , if there will be a next edition
beware , that this dvd does not have english audio track despite its amazon description . this is an outstanding movie , but amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me
after reading several of the top rated reviewers here , i think it 's time someone outside his family , or the people who work at his record company , had a say . this album is complete tripe . he ca n't sing or dance . still , he blows david hasslehoff out of the water at least
after reading the novel by jane yolen with my 7th grade classes , i was eager to view the film version . i had heard conflicting views of the film- it 's great , it 's horrible , etc . after viewing it for myself , i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews . however , despite its lack-luster performance , the film did serve a purpose in the classroom . true , the film leaves something to be desired . they change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them . editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story . rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely . major events in the rising action are left out , thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing . overall , very few of my students liked the film adaptation of jane yolen 's novel , which they found so riveting . on a brighter side , because of so many differences , viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through t-charts and venn diagrams . it also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills . after reading the novel and viewing the film , most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear !
i had to read this book for my highschool literature class . now i enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year . this book put me to sleep . the only reason this book gets two stars is because of the trojan war chapter which i wished was longer . it was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading , unlike the rest of the book . i only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that do n't waste your time
people buy fast food , they know its bad for them . people pay the geek squad <NUM> to do <NUM> minutes of work . people also pay <NUM> bucks for words & techno beats called `` pop music '' . amazing , if you had this much money : go get a gym membership . pay off your cars . donate it to children 's hospital . why support some teen that in <NUM> years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion
this album is a mess . it bounces around and resembles a long warm up . it does not seem to have a direction as it bounces around between a lot of different types of music and never finds a home with any of them
i would not recommend buying this dvd . poor production value and if you are expecting to enjoy some music by christina prepare yourself for disappointment and boredom . it 's about <NUM> % pr people ranting about christina and her accomplishments . i admire christina 's music and her god given talent for singing along with her hard work but this dvd is definitely worth passing up . i would recommend the stripped concert in the uk but not this one
precious is an interesting document of a band in flux , searching for a sound . gnecco 's voice is in fine form , but on only his second record , he is repeating himself . the wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again , which begs the question , is there true vocal range here , or a couple of parlor trick notes ? we will not be sure until we hear more form ours . when not in falsetto , gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery . in addition , the chemistry between the band seems off , making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed , the guitar lines which milone and gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes , seem dissonant and unneccessary . this music would be better served by simpler production . ethan johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that is n't sure weather it 's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff . & quot ; leaves & quot ; is the lone high spot for this album , with its catchy beatles meets u2 progression . the rest of the album , as typified by & quot ; kill the band & quot ; lacks cohesion , hooks , and musical identity . instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves , it seems like gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple . lyrically , gneeco could use some help , as he is repeating rhymes , and syllabic patterns all over the place . from a standpoint of lyical meaning , the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe . nothing new here . maybe just a sophomore jinx . stay tuned
i did not like this book at all . i speak clearly but i want to be more articulate and hold my `` audiences '' attention . the breathing exercises and banging out the zzzzs and ee-i-ee-i-oos did not help me . maybe i just do n't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information . i also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names . it got a little old after a while
before i got married i really excited to incorporate irish customs and traditions . i was so happy when i received this book , until i started reading it . do n't get me wrong it is a very interesting book . but although my husband and i are of irish decent , being what would be concidered protestant christians i was unable to incorporate any of the blessings or ideas for readings , since they were all meant for a catholic wedding . if you want history buy the book . if you 're catholic buy the book . for the rest of us . . .save your money for your honeymoon
i 'm a huge u2 fan but maybe i 'm the only one on this world who does n't like r.e.m . very much.i find songs like drive , everybody hurts and man on the moon ( one of my favourite ) very beautiful.but the other songs are boring and ripetitive.i do n't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.i hope one day i 'll understand this band ..
look . they got tired of trying to explain to their customers exactly what their products are and how they work , so they wrote a book to educate and sell them . it 's basically a hardback brochure . i 'm sure they give it to all their hot prospects . but we the little people get to pay for it . there is some useful info on leading indicators but nothing you could n't find elsewhere free . and once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on , guess what ? you 're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them , not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are . booksellers need to stop carrying this kind of 'gotcha ' book
i have several of mr. thompson 's cd 's which i like , but this one is really bad . imagine listening to relaxing music , but some kid is at your stereo playing with the balance control , making everything go all in your left ear , then all in your right ear , then back and forth randomly . after <NUM> minutes i could n't take it anymore . someone else might find that relaxing , but i most certainly did not
tony yayo 's `` thoughts of a predicate felon '' suffers from the fact that tony yayo simply does n't know who he is ( or who he is supposed to be ) on this album . before i listened to this album , i expected to hear gritty , descriptive rhymes about yayo 's criminal life . unfortunately however , i , like many of you , tuned into tracks such as `` tattle teller , '' `` curious , '' and `` project princess . '' for an ex-convict , that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more ... hardcore ; something better . on tracks such as `` live by the gun '' and `` homicide , '' yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for `` harder '' lyrics , but tracks such as these are few and far between . hopefully tony yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now , this debut album is simply a dissapointment
i continue to be astounded at how carelessly amazon reviewers throw around their <NUM> star ratings . this movie is overlong and not especially comedic or romantic . the main character ( or the actress who plays her anyway ) is appealing , but her motivations to start a new life are n't convincing or justified . her `` romance '' with the waiter is ludicrous and the ending is contrived and predictable . it actually took me <NUM> days to see the ending because i just did n't have the patience to view this from beginning to end in one sitting . if you are a patient , die-hard romantic with <NUM> hours to kill , i guess you might enjoy it . i am not and i did not
good concept , title , and cover ... but lacking good pictures . any most pictures are very small . lots of good writing , though
average singer with below average arrangements on often sung standards . i was expecting at least some re-harmonization on these tunes but very much straight from the fakebook kind changes . the horn lines were not too exciting . well .... overall , very clean and straight
i think susan sontag is missing the political nature of illness . as far as i 'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine . the victim is blamed because the victim has little power . the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful , the oil companies are powerful , the sugar companies are powerful , the retail chains are powerful , the manufacturers are powerful , the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful . they have armies of lawyers to defend them ; they have armies of doctors , scientists , and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest , but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame . this is n't about language , it 's about politics of money and power . language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill , and victims more generally
this is the worst song i listed to in my life it sound like a banre
this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon.com never sent it too me . this has happened about 4/5 times . while usually i have no problem getting movies , sometimes i do . sending them e-mails does n't seem to work . if they did n't have the best prices for movies , i 'd leave
dark descent is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding . filmed in czechloslovakia , most of the actors and crew 's names end in `` v '' . which would n't be so bad if they could at least act . dean cain , he of superman fame , bullies his way through the mess , chewing his gum , and wincing after he gets shot in the leg . scott wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits , but the movie never says what happens to him . the movie starts off with cain and wiper ( sounds like a law firm , do n't it ? ) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant . nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this , but cain kills them all but one , a nasty guy who plans revenge . meanwhile , many of the crew members are committing suicide , and cain is investigating . ( excited yet ? ) . of course , it all culminates in a kind of underwater high noon when the bad guy who promised to come back , does so with two other goons , and chase cain around the plant for a while . there is nothing exciting about any of this , as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal . try the abyss or ghost ship or any other undersea film , and you 'll do much better than this waste of celluloid
this does n't include rude mood in either studio or live version , travis walk , riviera paradise , or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts . this compilation is a serious waste of money . virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation , especially texas flood or in step . better yet by far , though , would be to get `` the essential stevie ray vaughan and double trouble . '' it 's bargain priced , and contains every song you could want or expect , including the excellent , posthumously-released acoustic blues song , `` life by the drop . '' srv is a guitarist worth discovering , but this compilation wo n't show you anything
this item was never received . amazon 's tracking system claims that it was shipped on january <NUM> by canada post .
in the 1950s , television filled the void left by the senate inquiries and the imposition of the comics code . a new resurgence in the 60s , comic books were exciting again , carrying into the 70s spurred by superhero and horror/mystery comics . bottoming out again in the eighties , this time the culprit- video games . today the enemies , television and gaming , are still with us vieing for our time . comics are not truly accessable to the buying public . they 've become the property of an exclusive club that seems to revel mostly in some artist 's wet dreams . how nice to know they can excercise his or her artistic rights and freedom . but no one is buying it ! it 's dead for all intents and purposes . comic shops have to fill their shelves with collectible toys to make it . the comics i buy are at liest more than <NUM> years old . the new ones just are not interesting and even with all of this self-examination and navel probing , the quality just is n't there . it 's my opinion that it does n't have to read like shakespear and look like rembrant to be a good comic . but it must entertain . the effort has been underway for years to leave the lowly comic book in the dust , replaced by the graphic novel . all in the name of impoving ( the perception anyway ) of the comic book market ! even hbos tales from the crypt '' opening credits state 'adapted from the comic magazine ... ' the internet will not save comic books . it is n't a 'book ' in the first place . illegal downloading will kill it . scanning comic books is already a problem . the salvation of the medium is in the hands of something that is not real ? if you can not hold it and carress it in your hands like a lover then it will not satisfy ( oops , better watch my own dreaming ! ) . i do have a love affair with comic books . the only salvation i believe are two things : <NUM> ) comic books must be put back into the public eye through stores or what have you . recruitment to comic books through casual 'walk by ' customers who are not necessarily seeking out comics , they just happen upon them out in public stores . yes , the great unwashed and 'unenlightend ' masses parting with their three bucks is the only thing that will help save the comicbooks ! <NUM> ) the superhero must die ! and artists and writers must excercise self control or face the imposition of a new comics code
knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of dire straits . perhaps he is attempting to be mr. atkins reincarnate , but if that is the case then he should buy the white shoes and move to florida . simply put , a terrible album with little to recommend it .
why of course the chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the scotsmen jardine and matheson ! it just like when americans have a cocaine problem , it is the us government , and not the drug smugglers and dealers , that has the responsibility . and if the chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic , well , it 's for their own good you know . at least that 's herman 's view . also , the scots who thus created hong kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves . yes , they did make a little money but that 's not why they were in china . they imported opium in order to create hong kong so that one day it will become a `` premier '' commercial city of the orient , with the ultimate goal of teaching china western financial and economic techniques . if it were not for jardine and matheson , how could china have become a great power today , or a candidate superpower tomorrow ? no , these two far-sighted scots had this noble , lofty goal in mind when they came to china , nothing lesss . when historians condemn these two for their `` crime '' ( drug-dealing , that is ) they forget that they are actually heroes , as herman sees so clearly and correctly . and so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the scots do n't even have a country they can call their own while the `` barbaric '' and `` decadent '' chinese do
yes , jordan writes well , uses words and descriptions beautifully . one of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as `` elegiac '' and it certainly is , but elegiac only takes a book so far . beyond that , you need interesting characters that the reader cares about , set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative . perfect example , atonement . sadly , shade joins the pile of books i put down after wading through more than <NUM> pages . i could not finish it even though i was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read
this movie really did n't show me anything exciting in salsa dance ... the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers willie colon and celia cruz .
first time i looked through this book , was curiosity of my local library . checked out , and was blown away with how cool this book is . that was <NUM> months ago . being a big u2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book . after a few minutes of 'reading ' it , realized how crappy the pictures in the book are . seemes like 90-99 % of the pictures are washed out , grainy , and horribly reproduced here . was there any quality control as this book went to press ? and for those 'new , never before seen pictures ' they are pretty ho hum . because its not totally horrid , i 'd give it 2.5 stars . just , well , disappointing . if i had to pay the full msrp , i 'd give it zero stars . while i must say , for $ <NUM> or so , you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be ...
other reviews rant about ms. judd ; frankly , after double jeopardy and high crimes , i 'm not seeing the superb actress , but that 's aside the point . this movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else -- search for truth , not innocence . especially if you are an attorney
sad that phil went the way of pop diva ... horrible ... makes all progressive fans cringe ... should make all music fans cringe
warning to all parents purchasing this for a child . both vol <NUM> and <NUM> contain nudity and may not be suitable for children . guess that 's the difference between a comic book and a graphic novel ..
warning : some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such . they fade out half way thru the song . i was very disapointed . would be much better in chronological order . it is in some places , but then jumps around for no apparent reason . it seems like barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is , and he is very talented . it is just this box set tries to do too many things , and accomplishes nothing . it just tries too hard .
how can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with ? i listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than <NUM> seconds . this cd is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding
paleolithic jarre fare of toe stompin synthesizer anthems . with no concept of sublime codification . heroic calculated in your face arrangements leave a relatively transient impression . electric boogie ala francais
this slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks . the authors are indeed esteemed but i bet each one wrote their part from memory on a sunday afternoon . the battle descriptions are dry and confusing -- most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events . geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself . i usually read reviews before i buy a book and this time i just & quot ; assumed & quot ; good quality due to the national geographic society imprimatur . stay away
christopher byron 's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded , pathologically envious little weasle of a man , who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture . unless you 're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful , brilliant , talented women because the light from great women 's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life , avoid this book . byron is simply a mean little vampire , trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of martha . shame on john wiley & amp ; sons for publishing this book
somewhere in turkey , there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby . to this place come one american professor who needs to publish a paper , one graduate student as assistant ( and love interest ) , and four naÔve undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college . deep in this forest , moreover , a group of terrorists are hiding , and the us special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive . ( but do american college students need to fly all the way to turkey to graduate ? travel financed by one of the rich student 's daddy ? ) part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of ` predator , ' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur ` pterodactyl ' - no , in fact , pterodactyls , to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit . unlike arnold schwarzenegger classic , however , the creatures in ` pterodactyl ' only bore you to death because of their cheesy cgi and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story . the film is not scary , nor exciting even with occasional gore , and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games , what can you expect from the rest of the film 's <NUM> minutes ? coolio is the captain of the special unit , and his acting itself is not bad . but at the same time , i am afraid , not many people would find the idea of coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing , and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination . the other actors are not great either , but with this bad story and dialogues , and most of all very unconvincing creatures , none one can be blamed . the saddest thing is that the director is mark l. lester , who once did the underrated action film ` commando ' back in <NUM> with schwarzenegger . that was a ridiculous story , but i really liked the way schwarzenegger 's hero talked and behaved ( throwing a telephone booth ! ) . it was silly , but it was fun . ` pterodactyl ' is silly , and tries to be fun , which you know it is not
i purchased video for my <NUM> month old and was really disappointed by this video . first , it claimed to tell the story of noah 's ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about noah . my daughter watched the video half-way though ( which is not so bad ) but in general , prefers baby noah by baby einstein and noah 's ark by baby miracle . while the video has a few pretty images , i do not recommend it . hope my review is helpful .
to see my point read edgar c. whisenant 's `` why the rapture will be in <NUM> '' ha-ha-ha-ha ! ! ! ! ! do n't be taken in by tim lahaye 's false prophecies asd broken promises . this book has stated nothing that christendom has not heard before . it 's the same old `` the sky is falling '' , superstitious , nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times . for example : 1john 2:18 , 4:4 - john thinks he is living in `` the last times . '' he `` knows '' this because he sees so many antichrists around . <NUM> peter 1:5 , <NUM> , <NUM> peter believed that he was living in the `` last times . <NUM> peter 4:7 `` the end of all things is at hand . '' james 5:8 james thought that jesus would return soon . readers , has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called `` end time signs '' did not apply ? the civil war , wwi , wwii , the could war and all other wars and rumors of war was n't good enough ? one of the signs of the `` mark of the beast '' started in <NUM> . the doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the social security number system . recently , someone `` set a bad precedent '' by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip ( in the wayward animal of course ) it seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the chicken littles has been making excuses ever since it all began . <NUM> peter 3:4 `` where is the promise of his coming ? '' the author of <NUM> peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers . he knows that jesus , who was to come soon , did n't come at all . many have begun to ask , `` where is the promise of his coming ? '' he tries to cover for jesus by claiming that `` one day with the lord is as a thousand years . '' mat : -16:28 verily i say unto you , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom . revelation - 3:11 , 22:7 , <NUM> , <NUM> quotes jesus ( <NUM> years ago ) as saying , `` behold , i come quickly . lahaye 's book reads like tabloid trash . ! ! ! ! !
got ta go with the folks who are dbt fans but think they missed a step on this one . yeah , `` february <NUM> '' and `` gravity 's gone '' are good tracks , but other than that it 's pretty forgettable . i 'm especially bummed by jason isbell 's tunes - what the heck happened ? the tracks he wrote for `` dirty south '' and `` decoration day '' were far and away the best songs on amazing records . now he sounds like a doobie brother or something equally silly . c'mon guys , get it together !
having travelled all over the usa by automobile , i was disappointed at the paucity of information and the highly selective coverage in this book . i had hoped to obtain an update , and more comprehensive coverage of all <NUM> states . i found it too selective with major ommissions by state ( e.g . kentucky has no entries at all ) and smaller to mid-size communities such as champaign , illinois , or the beautiful rock river valley of nw illinois are conspicuous by their absence . most disturbing is this . i live in the greater houston , tx , area , and read the authors ' motel recommendation on us-59 . not only is that motel and immediate area known for being a place of constant drug raids , but also it is a major area of known street prostitution and that motel seems to house them . i hardly consider that `` family friendly ''
the biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the cia - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary . there was passage after passage that begged for insight that her ( limited ) experience brought , but i do n't remember a single case of finding this . the criticism of the cia training is rendered in terms of the students ' shortcomings in the exercises , with no thought to why they did n't do better , or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable . i suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the cia refreshing and useful/needed , and that they could fill in the insights on their own . despite having read multiple of the reviews here , i was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life ( one reviewer overstates it as being <NUM> % ) and how trite it was . the reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something , but what i encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager . the librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer ( 2006-aug-15 ) who reported it ( reviewer gave it <NUM> stars for the teen reader ) . the book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting , and this may keep you reading . however , that person never emerges
the 1st <NUM> flicks have come on gone ... world at war gets left behind ( pun intended ) . i hoped i 'd never see the day when i 'd have to give an attempted prophecy movie thumbs down , but here we have it . to keep it short and sweet , many of the same characters are present from the 1st <NUM> films ( which were true to the book ) , however , this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book <NUM> , as cloud <NUM> veers away from the continuum of the book series . it 's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together . definately not a keeper ... stick to the first <NUM> and then add the moment after and six : the mark unleashed to your collection instead .
i dont know why people like broken social scene , they are boring boring boring . i listned to this entire album and it was difficult . i wanted to turn it off really bad , but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone . for real though people , there is tons of music outthere that is not boring . you should check it out
i hate ac/dc , them and metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department . as musicians , these guys are very average at best , most of the time , they 're below average . it does n't matter if it 's bon scott or brian johnson singing for them , ac/dc has always sucked . unlike other metal bands like slayer and sepultura , ac/dc 's songs are very cheesy and boring , the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia . want real <NUM> 's metal ( not glam ) ? go for slayer , sepultura , kreator , exodus , iron maiden , judas priest , mercyful fate , hellhammer and many others
that this is such a religious book . i want my money back ..
having enjoyed russo 's pulitzer prize winning novel `` empire falls , '' i was eager to give something else of his a try . maybe i should have selected one of his earlier novels instead because `` the whore 's child , '' interesting title aside , becomes tired and repetitive very quickly . the themes are the same in each story : aging male professor with an itchy prostate faces a mid-life situation , usually involving his younger second wife . that may sound too specific to relate to all of the stories in this collection , but you would be disappointed to realize that it is very accurate . the lone exception , and the novel 's best story , is the titular work about a nun who is , in point of fact , a whore 's child -- and the discrepancy between the generations makes for a poignant story . and yet , even that one includes a male professor character who is teaching the nun in his creative writing class , so similarities remain . despite that , the story is great . the rest ... well , if russo had done away with the other six achingly similar stories and expanded them into a single novella the book would have been much better . russo is certainly capable of spinning a great yarn , and the themes are fine if a little familiar ( russo seems to be an author that excells in that domain ) . i just think you would do better to stick with the format best suited to his talents : his novels . i know that i will from now on
i purchased this dvd a while ago - fyi - a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie . i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found . here , years later , when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe . i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this book is attractively laid out and demonstrates ( briefly ) some techniques for people who have the knowledge to use them . i do n't have it unfortunately . the authors say that knowing photoshop would be `` helpful '' ; i suspect it 's required in order to do the digital printing described here . they also recommend a more basic text on digital printing to understand this book , and that kind of knowledge also appears to be required . that and a big printer ! if i were qualified to use the information , i would probably give it <NUM> or <NUM> stars .
my advice is to watch this in french , which is less painful especially if you do n't speak french . in english , its unbearable . slow ? at one point the dvd froze and i did n't realize it for several minutes
while this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece than a useful treatise on martial arts . while the author is an experienced , highly knowledgeable practitioner , his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate . do n't get me wrong ; i certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot . i believe that he is the victim of bad teaching , an all too common occurrence in martial arts . for example , he states that , `` today 's full-contact fighters throw devastating , lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet . against this kind of speed , classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance . what amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are , otherwise , extremely potent arts ... '' this is just flat wrong . contrary to mr. orlando 's understanding , in classical blocks the hand that is out ( e.g . just punched or blocked ) performs the actual block , check , or deflection , while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent 's limb . even though it is often hidden , almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology . in all cases , there is never ever any `` wind-up '' preceding anything . in most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact . to delve deeper , the word `` uke '' translates more accurately to `` receive '' than it does to `` block . '' when viewed in this context , it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check , deflect , or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force . using the traditional check/control methodology , a practitioner 's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent 's body . in this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most `` devastating '' of punches no matter how fast , or how powerfully , or even how unexpectedly they are thrown . common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that i believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles . regardless , i hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated ... now that i 've ripped him down , i will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book . for example , the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life . if you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo , training with loose fitting clothes , you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots . this is a very valid point . i wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school . all in all , however , there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like i got my money 's worth from purchasing it . it was disappointing . get sifu orlando 's book `` indonesian fighting fundamentals : the brutal arts of the archipelago '' instead . it 's a great read and well worth buying . lawrence kane author of surviving armed assaults , the way of kata , and martial arts instructio
junie b. jones : kindergartener . she 's worrying about having a boyfriend and living & quot ; happily ever after & quot ; in her strange junie-like world . first of all , her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named warren , who just wants to be left alone . even lucille and grace liked him , and junie b liked him because he was on a t.v . commercial . i 'm <NUM> now , and i think junie b has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend . then , she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make warren notice him . she made comments like : & quot ; and he was beauty to our eyes ... & quot ; & quot ; what a chunk. & quot ; and & quot ; ... i think i 'd like him as my new boyfriend. & quot ; she said she needed to & quot ; move on in her life & quot ; , which i thought was silly . ok , so she learned you should n't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you , but junie b needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her english
i finally found the book that should never have been written . the book was given to me , so i tried to read it . why would anyone waste their time comparing tom clancy 's novel hero against real life presidents and presidental polices ? i have concluded that the author must be jealous of clancy 's success and thought he could make a little money writing a book comparing a fictitious character virsus real presidental policy . this book really deserved a minus star
see above for reviews that pinpoint some of the problems with this album . production quality ( or uniquely bad production choices ) , lack of musical enthusiasm , appalling lack of catchy tunes or lyrics from a band i thought had true capabiities -- pick the flaw that bugs you the most . any way you slice it this album is a stinker . better luck next time cyhsy . ( your first album was gold . ) consumers : make sure to listen to those samples before you buy this one . if you are looking for more great songs like the ones on their first effort then this is n't it . i 'm convinced that the band knew what they had made this time around and that the title , `` some loud thunder , '' must be a witty , veiled reference to flatulence .
first off , i 'm not a fan of the writing style . it covers so much information and time with little dialogue , or characters for that matter . but that 's just the style . the way the story was presented was what i had a problem with . it seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like , and he did n't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book , so he just presented it as fiction , but did n't quite know how to do that . characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth . then , they drop off . all of a sudden , near the end , they come back , and now they 're like generals or something , or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of armaggedon . what ? ! this book is a grid , a blueprint for a certain way it could happen . it is not a story about people , or a story with a plot . it is just a list of events that read on until jesus comes . the only reason i gave it two stars was because it did n't follow the whole rapture-theory at all ( that word is n't in the bible , and even implications of one does n't say when during the tribulation it would be ) . in this story , the christians are here for the whole thing , and everything is n't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the left behind series . it follows the premise that throughout the last century or so , we 've already experienced the seal judgements , and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face . if you want a different take and are n't expecting much of anything else , read this , but not if you want a real story with passion or voice .
being an oriental i am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours , although not as extensive as standard hollywood productions . with japanese films , whether it was made by a kurusawa or a more obscure artisan , i can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in pace , inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals , and are generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively substandard . village of dreams , while touted as an award winner is a glaring testimony of this stunted japanese film-making characteristic . review it yourself . the pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing . it was the same character that can be seen even in kurusawa 's ran - a & quot ; highly acclaimed & quot ; work that in my case , i could n't even view for the third time , because even its dvd resolution has a quality that can only be likened to the eye-view of a person who 's suffering his earliest stage of creeping glaucoma . village of dreams is so & quot ; relaxed & quot ; as if the filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they enjoyed in 1940s japan in an obscure countryside . at the very least , the straight narrative of this film is a consolation , but with ran , the actions were so hard to follow , you 'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking whom . the most unforgivable quality of this dvd transfer is the poor film stock . the picture approximates that of a & quot ; third generation & quot ; recording of a vhs copy . this means that you 'll be sorely dissapointed of having to get a vhs-quality copy copied , in turn , from another vhs copy which was copied from the original vhs & quot ; master tape & quot ; . of course , the dvd transfer is not at fault , its simply that the japanese despite their touted techno prowess just could n't give us a decent film stock , that could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems . the glaring deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious , when shown on high resolution tvs . i 've viewed this film in a 29-inch sony wega flat tv , and in a 50-inch mitsubishi projection tv , from a pioneer dvl <NUM> and <NUM> . if not for the antics of the two children leads , village comes off as wearisome . i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i 'm a film collector . its works like this that whets my appreciation for world cinema . unfortunately , village 's poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment , as well as negating its & quot ; collectability & quot ; factor . this should have looked more glorious if it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like what dreams may come or dark city , but of course that 's asking too much from those editing-challenged japanese filmakers . i want to ask amazon for a refund because this is not well worth its price value . i was compulsed to buy it because of its cover , i thought it was at least as exotically glorious-looking as kundun , but it proved to be just a small , obscure production . critics may raved about it , just like those canadians did with black robe , but the final word is that they 're just run of the mill , albeit thoughtful , films ....
one of the weaker entries in this hit-and-miss collection of new wave singles , there is only one legitimate reason to own this , but it 's a great reason : miracle legion 's & quot ; the backyard. & quot ; miracle legion was a mid-80 's college radio band which , like most of the college radio bands of the era , had that sort of post-byrds , post-vu moody guitar jangle sound ( i.e . r.e.m. , guadalcanal diary , reivers , connells , winter hours , etc. ) . not a great band , but this one song -- by far their best -- is unforgettable . an irresistable hook and some moving lyrics about growing out of boyhood make it one of those songs that , 15+ years later i can still sing from memory . it bears about as much relationship to & quot ; new wave & quot ; as , say , husker du , but , hey , what can you do . the rest of this disc ranges from the sort of lame radio hits my generation was forced to live with at the time ( & quot ; voices carry & quot ; ) to songs so bad that the mere thought of them still makes me wince ( & quot ; sunglasses at night & quot ; )
there is one thing i finally grasped upon watching 'the <NUM> year old virgin ' , however . i came to the realization that hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ( 'the <NUM> year old virgin ' ) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas . of course , they 're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental united states will be for , and laugh at , anything . this film is popular because steve carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'the office ' , and people just love those mannerisms ( ricky gervals is better in the same role , by the way ... but that 's neither here nor there ) . it certainly could n't be because it 's funny . the general concept of a <NUM> year old virgin has promise . that concept added with the most boiled down middle school potty jokes is not . that concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive , yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not . that concept added with a cross eyed asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up 's of carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not . that concept added with <NUM> year old middle eastern salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not . you get the drift . maybe the boat left and i was n't on the boat . maybe i 'm not <NUM> years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating chocodiles . if you like juvenile humor , watch something like 'better off dead ' or 'caddyshack ' . watch a movie that does n't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh . sincerely , bill cosb
usually the & quot ; grammy nominees & quot ; series produces a compilation in which , understandably , some pieces are way below the others in quality . the <NUM> edition suffers more than ever of this syndrome . in fact , quality is truly hard to find on this cd . under the label of & quot ; pop & quot ; several unworthy songs somehow find their way into the selections . hard to understand why , but the few decent tracks merely manage to assert that some effort was actually put into the decision . the variety of genres that appear merely confuse me about what exactly is the purpose of this cd , rather than provide a large field from which to find something that i like . the fact is , it is so broad that a fan of a particular style of music will be left utterly disappointed . <NUM> ) & quot ; say my name & quot ; - a normally catchy song that seems out of place on this album . <NUM> ) & quot ; i try & quot ; - decent effort by macy gray , but she does not deserve to win a grammy . <NUM> ) & quot ; music & quot ; - madonna 's new song is nothing above average . <NUM> ) & quot ; bye bye bye & quot ; - usually annoying 'nsync produce a better to digest single , but no reason to incorporate on this cd . <NUM> ) & quot ; beautiful day & quot ; - u2 's magnificent song , one of the best of the year , is one of the high points on the album . <NUM> ) & quot ; sexx laws & quot ; - mildly agreeable beck single similar to most of his work . <NUM> ) & quot ; the real slim shady & quot ; - overplayed eminem single is great , but no reason to buy this cd ; buy his album instead . <NUM> ) & quot ; optimistic & quot ; - extremely disappointing song from radiohead ; a definite weak point . <NUM> ) & quot ; you 're the one & quot ; - paul simon 's new track is enjoyable at most , but marks musical talent at its best . <NUM> ) & quot ; cousin dupree & quot ; - moderately bouncy music by steely dan does not justify their win . <NUM> ) & quot ; what a girl wants & quot ; - it is simply shameful to include such kind of bubble gum pop on a respectable compilation <NUM> ) & quot ; save me & quot ; - very docile and slightly unnerving song from a new artist ; decidedly bad choice . <NUM> ) & quot ; both sides now & quot ; - another uninspired pick ; nondescript in every way . <NUM> ) & quot ; oops ! i did it again ! & quot ; - britney is ok , but if she deserved a place at the grammys , it would have to be for her prevoius album . <NUM> ) & quot ; show me the meaning ... & quot ; - almost disturbing backstreet boys have no place in the same room with a grammy ; a ghastly song , truly repulsive . <NUM> ) & quot ; pinch me & quot ; - the best and the brightest on this album ; barenaked ladies truly underrated as a band , always producing high quality music . <NUM> ) & quot ; breathless & quot ; - the corrs are nothing spectacular , but still bearable . to make a long story short , this album is only for collectors
there are better cary grant movies out there to watch . this one is just about ok . the movie dvd is released by various companies . i had the bfc edition , and was not very thrilled by the print
i have never read one of johansen 's books and after reading this one , i 'm not likely to read another . i usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but i just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing . exclamations such as `` dear heaven '' and `` lord '' were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone ( it would suit my southern grandma , however ) . as another reviewer said , the big mystery of why daisy would n't leave geneva was n't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted jason to leave she could have just told him . character development was lacking and i just did n't care that much about them . i would have liked to hear more about cynthia and her antics . i did finish the book because i was curious to know what happened , but i could n't wait for it to be over . sorry , but this was not my cup of tea
the narrator has an unbelievably irratating voice ! she has a lisp ! ! ! ! i swear ! ! the absolute worst choice was made in selecting a speaker ! hilarious ! ! ! buy it for the laughs ! ! ! !
we enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor , but my friend , a survivor of auschwitz birkenau and a forced labor camp , was finally outraged by this treatment of the holocaust , as was i . a child in auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience ! my friend would have been gassed to death , because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of <NUM> soon after he left for a labor camp . watch divided we fall instead ! or for a very good depiction of life in the camps , watch fateless or the grey zone
i see that some people were helped by this book . i would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex . the advice to virgins was disgusting . the writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it . the writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive . i thought the book was sick . it turns women into an object of function . it also talks about men being <NUM> % head of the household and women being <NUM> % submissive . the authors are a husband and wife but i ca n't hear a woman 's voice anywhere in this book . the cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that . i 'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude
this is the first ds book that i have read in about <NUM> years & it made me realize why did i try again ? ? ? ? ? ? ? can i really find a book centered around a <NUM> year old male stud-muffin real ? i wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a <NUM> year old female stud muffin ? i would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance . coop only dates <NUM> something 's . he has a <NUM> something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child . this does n't bother his new girlfriend , an ( early <NUM> 's ) resident pediatrician , who works in icu with preemies at all , who tells him to `` have her get an abortion '' . a bit too blas√Ø¬ø¬Ω for me . coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy . i had a hard time getting into this premise . the way ds totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable . everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters . every character is , of course , extremely wealthy ( even though several are hiding it ) . most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are . i realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for ds .
let 's just get this out of the way now . maysa ? i 'm on your team babes , but this cd just has n't done it for me . i got your 1st cd & was hooked . i waited for the next & was floored ! not in a good way ! the cd jacket was so drab & tired , just like damn near every song inside the case . i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again . still i did n't feel it . it 's in my car right now & i still ca n't get through it all . i 'm still on your team though . i have your latest & i play it <NUM> death . over & over . cd 's <NUM> & <NUM> are both must haves . but this <NUM> stinks
the songs in this cd were sang by thousand other singers million times . unless if it 's done differently with new arrangements , new style , better performance it 's a total waste . my suggestion , please find new songs , there are plenty out there . give the new writers a chance , pay them few dollars and give them some royalties . and you il divo , will sound more unique and different . after all you have great voices
i liked vin diesel despite riddick and thought that he can be a good action star . unfortunately , this movie at the very least did n't demonstrate his acting abilities ( unless you consider looking tough as an acting skill ) . grunted , the movie does n't help . it is badly written , badly directed . overall , mediocre b-movie .
i found this book embarrassing to read - not because it 's risque , but because it so clearly illustrates how the french & italians got their reputations as great lovers . is this the best that english literature can give us ? this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality . it 's also mean-spirited . lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman , and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept . this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal . he drips way too much contempt . everything outside of sex is dumb , meaningless , ridiculous . attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` mental life '' makes one ridiculous ; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ; trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence 's own true and correct way makes one pathetic , or defective , or spiteful ; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . looking at italian art is stupid . everything in paris is stupid . constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly . reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what 's `` wrong '' with everyone except c. and m. , one might easily conclude that constance does n't really seem happier now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as delusional and druglike . he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there 's something wrong with her . of course constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not mellors , but mellors ' equipment . this book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically comical . hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures : from venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a `` user '' , with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously lawrence does n't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a `` user '' . ) it 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of real sex . this is where astute readers will have the most trouble . lawrence clearly defines a `` real '' woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples . a woman who lays there `` unfeeling '' is clearly an example . such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically , but in character . on the other hand , a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be pathetic ) , but it turns unforgiveable when it 's women in general and especially mellor 's bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . bertha just had a sick ( ! ) urge to be in control , demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature . the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` spoilt '' her . as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ? forget it . lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental , nothing important . a real woman does n't need foreplay . just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later . these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too passive , but not too active , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her own fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not true . the truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part . women have always known about their own bodies ; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . this , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . the author ( or at least mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . it 's also likely that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even noxious emotions and desires - such as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's biological job is to get his dna out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment . if this is true , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child . so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does , at the same time it 's not so clearly obvious that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify lawrence 's open belittling of women whose emotional states do n't match masculine emotional detachment and distance . there 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow `` lacking tenderness '' - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find . i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal ( remembering she 's a lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible . for what it 's worth , i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete . it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages , if not their selves . those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion . as for those who just want a good read - i 'd call it a matter of personal taste . obviously some people enjoy this book . ( equally obviously , i did not .
such a wonderful book has been brought down several notches by employing a reader that puts one to sleep . my travels are made signifacantly more enjoyable by listening to books-on-cd while driving . i 've tried several times to listen to the civil war but had to give it up . mr. whitener 's voice is so drone and expressionless that i quickly loose interest . sorry to be so negative , but this cd is very disappointing . stick to the book
it goes like this ... hero muses , is followed , takes a meeting , phones , travels , phones , takes a meeting , travels , phones , takes a meeting , phones , travels , takes a meeting , etc , etc . if this is what makes for a good novel , it 's all yours . i do n't care if this is how they do it in real life in the cia , it 's damn dull reading . the real mystery with this novel is why it ever got good reviews
i consider myself a beginner yogi ( have been to about 5-7 classes over the past year ) , and i found this video to be extremely unchallenging . this video might be good for someone recovering from an injury and who has never tried yoga before . although sara ivanhoe comes off as a friendly , non-threatening gym buddy , i just could n't overcome the total lack of breath awareness that seems to be a basic part of yoga . also , i am not in very good shape , and i did n't even break a sweat during the 'fat burning ' workout .
honestly , all her songs are sexual in some way . the way she poses , moves , dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across . she is unmodest , makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos , cant sing to save her life . rebecca st. james is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [ ... ] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer . get her transform album . great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message , better voice , and in my oponion , better looking artist .
i had read the reviews of this album and picked it up on the strength of the positive comments , but i was shocked at how terrible this album was . understanding herbert 's classical piano background , i expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone , but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used . the first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals , which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic . the rhythms were also boring , none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat , but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a casio keyboard . stay away
bland , bland , and more bland . it seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance , and fell far short of the mark . with the except on the main character 's mother , nearly every single character was completely unlikeable . and a little lea delaria goes a long , long way . it does replicate the 80s very well , but it just feels so devoid of humanity
being an avid admirer of manet and of the paintings in which victorine meurent appeared , i was happy to see a book about her . finally , i would be able to learn something of her and her life ! i learned that she was a lesbian and died in <NUM> and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her . but that is all i learned . the book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else . if you want to learn about victorine , you must find another book . if you want to know about eunice lipton , this is the book for you . also very few facts in the book ; the author puts victorine in some situations and conversations , but these are all imaginary . definitely would not recommend . author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject
i have never written a review of a book before , but after reading this book i felt i had too . what happened to this series . the first two books were great , but this book dose n't even come close to being as good . somebody should have cut about <NUM> pages from this book . the first two books in the series i could'nt put down , but this book was very difficult to finish . i dont think i will read the 4th volume in this never ending series
`` all life/ has song ... '' stan rice announces at the start of `` singing yet , '' chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases , plus several new poems . rice ( who sadly passed away at the end of <NUM> ) displayed a flair for evocative imagery , but his poetry is so confusingly random that it 's almost impossible to decipher . the first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism ( comparing melons to a woman ) and odd morbidity ( `` it is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce '' ) . but in the `` some lamb '' section , rice delved into some deeper , more real turf : the death of his daughter from leukemia . `` we stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see . '' with an actual focus , rice 's poetry shifts into aching confusion , describing his daughter 's illness , death , and burial , all the emotions that came with it . unfortunately , rice 's poetry does n't improve after that , including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little , rice 's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical . `` the iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers ... '' dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem . but rice 's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible . `` golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack , assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers ? '' he announced at one point . okay , whatever . maybe it 's about death . interpret that as you will . while his poetry can be intriguing and seductive , most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together . certainly rice ca n't be faulted for his lack of description . he could evoke astoundingly weird , dali-esque images . the problem is , they seem strung together like beads . rather than focusing on one and exploring it , he seems just to have tossed them together randomly , assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection . `` thunder no more , sky/big sandwich gold & coral '' -- it does n't evoke anything by itself , and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it . an overview of stan rice 's poetry , with a stretch of new material , `` singing yet '' does n't shed any more light on what went through his head . nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing .
i agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order . after waiting for this item for several weeks already , i was today told by amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay . i have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from infantastic
this vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object 's future behavior . people have many connections to a place , which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations . these emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and `` at-will '' citizens for a long time to come . in reading the book , by the way , the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern , american style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends . it 's much more in an old fashioned english amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it 's all sort of breezy . some may like that .
unfortunatelly , until now i did not received my cd ! i guess what happened ? thanks , octavi
i eagerly awaited this album , ever since hearing mr. mitchell sing in the kiss me kate cd . his singing in kiss me kate is unbelievably gorgeous , with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word . the singer on this cd is hardly recognizable as the same singer . the timbre of the voice is not the same , mr. mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer , not the magnificent broadway star he is . i hope he does another album , the next time bringing to life great broadway songs in the style of his kiss me kate and man of la mancha performances .
this is honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i love the first one but this one is just lame
this documentary is poorly produced , has terrible sound quality and stereotypical `` life affirming '' stories . there was nothing in here to support wal-mart , their business practices or their philosophy
the rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around los angeles , particularly the miracle mile area . it 's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that ca n't stand on its own two feet . the plotting of the rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare . unfortunately , the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious . worse still is the execution of the material . every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma . bill campbell -- ever hear of him anymore ? he overacts every single scene . timothy dalton ? hammy . jennifer connelly is the only one to come out unscathed . the direction is beyond weak . when the rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged , so cloyingly `` goofy '' that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening . add to this foul mixture a horrendous james horner score ... you get the idea . still , some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points .
obviously both and finnegan proves it . joyce spent seventeen years on this book , which can be properly read and understood by only one person - james joyce , who passed away in <NUM> . now if you 'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of finnegans wake , you are certainly free to do so . and , having once attempted to achieve such understanding myself , i can assure you that some of your time will be well spent . but the facts are as follows : <NUM> . joyce was fluent in a number of european languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more . <NUM> . from this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used , with ordinary english syntax , to create the solipsistic discourse of finnegans wake . it is , in effect , a private language . <NUM> . since most of his vocabulary is drawn from , and puns on , the languages joyce was familiar with , the only way one can begin to understand what 's happening is to be as familiar with them as james joyce . <NUM> . the entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero , `` hce . '' this was joyce 's way of `` getting at '' ( whatever that means here ) some sort of unconscious european cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by james joyce , of course . <NUM> . finnegans wake is thus basically incomprehensible . the explications in campbell & robinson 's skeleton key , while well informed , are , as the authors admit ( though not in these words ) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books . by getting in on the ground floor , c & w effectively dared anyone to disagree . which would , of course , require another pair of literature ph.d. 's with another shelf of reference books . there can be more than one interpretation of finnegans wake , including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation . <NUM> . once in a while joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to english to carry some meaning . as readers of dubliners , portrait of the artist , and ulysses are aware , joyce was at one time a master of poetic english prose . searching for the poetic moments , and those alone , makes for a pleasant diversion , and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable . if you 're still intrigued , your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that anthony burgess put out forty years ago . burgess loved finnegans wake in the campbell-robinson interpretation , and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in finnegans ' greatness . the book may be useful to some as a kind of rorschach/i ching for your own creativity : `` how many puns and themes can * i * find ? '' this book allegedly turned derrida into a deconstructionist . i believe it . students of ocd and associated disorders should take a look at the entire finagin fannomenikonn , if you know what i mean .
is n't it funny that those posting negative reviews here write better , and seem better informed , than those posting positive reviews ? that alone speaks volumes as to whom this book appeals
this book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives , as it was to me , a survivor . it tells the story of one man in england , with moments that make you think there is a similarity , only to be disappointed . the only hope for the book is the wife 's diary , and her feelings from the event through the treatment . but even then there is the feeling that her diary in censored , knowing that it would be published . the author does direct the reader to some other good books , and gives us a happy ending . the book does teach us that life goes on , even if you have a stroke , but stroke suvivors already know that fact
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing . instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school . they also discover that they have been cheating on one another . the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters . i would have expected better from these two
george benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time . i bought this cd with the hope of hearing george benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about . george benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks , `` softly , as in a mountain sunrise '' and `` arizona sunrise . '' these are the only two tracks produce by paul brown . the other instrumental , `` take you out '' is a tribute to luther vandross and is on the `` forever , for always , for luther '' cd . george benson does showcase some of his talent , but he kept the song true to luthers ' rendition `` take you out . '' the bottom line is : if you think george benson is a great vocalist , you will love this cd , and in my opinion , he is just tolerable . three instrumental tracks , seven vocal tracks , this cd is not `` irreplaceable . ''
i totally agree with the couple of reviews where the book was sent back to amazon . some of the reviews are positively glowing and just why is beyond my comprehension , the book offers ( as do most watercolor instruction books ) considerable sound advice about supplies and composition etc etc etc but the pictures suck ! it is difficult for me to believe this is a professional artist ( presuming making a living on this humdrum output . ) she has a vey limited palette mostly autumnal browns and golds and mostly very small ( 8x8 and 12x12 ) pictures that are a hash and rehash of weeds leaves and branches , ,sometimes a watercolor book is so astoundingly beautiful it is worth having just to admire the pics , , , well , , , not this one ! totally ripped off is the feeling given ,
this is by far the most useless book on the subject of the state of education . for instance , while the authors make much of the relative stability of sat scores , they ignore the decline in scores from the naep , ctbs , and mat scores ( to name a few ) from the same period . they also keep silent about the fact that calculators were once forbidden from the math portion of the sat , playing a role no doubt in said stability . dr. lawrence stedman , an associate professor of education at the state university of new york at binghamton , ph.d. in educational policy studies , and self-decribed progressive & quot ; sympathetic to their concerns , & quot ; wrote an article in the peer-reviewed education policy analysis archives . he pointed out numerous examples of the fudging -- whether out of duplicity or incompetence , you judge -- of & quot ; facts & quot ; to support the authors ' farcical claims , and where such claims went unsupported . in other words , while criticism usually comes from & quot ; the enemy , & quot ; one of their own blasted this book for its inaccuracies . since it could not possibly have been written with a straight face , i recommend spending your money on something written with more integrity . there is a real crisis in education , there are manufacturers , and this book rolled straight off their assembly line
great cover , enticing premise . i could n't wait to read this book ... but ... every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly . let me add a couple more . frannie grows up , decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she 's going to do . what does her mother say ? that 's nice , dear . i trust you to make the right decision . oh please ! ! ! this is the 19th century after all ! then for good measure let 's throw this one into the mix . after the indomitable una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person , famous or not , that she comes into contact with ... she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole . an oil well ! you must be kidding ! of course , she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch . i could go on and on . i finished every page of this book although i must say i skimmed through the last <NUM> pages . when i finished and my husband asked how it was , the only way i could think to describe it was silly
i recently saw this book on the bargain bin . this book was pure garbage , by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits . basically they are saying valuations do n't matter . since they wrote the book , it has been prooven that their philosophy , approached over the long term , produces some great damaging losses . the book may be useful during the next bubble , which if history serves , will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky . to the dungeon with these two knaves
admittedly , i do n't scour the surface of the earth for hard to find b , c , and d-class tracks to add to my metal collection . if you do , you may agree with the novelist who wrote the first review on this set . as for me , this is one of those items that you just have to admit to yourself was a mistake and file it with sanitation engineering . luckily , i got mine on clearance
i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself . not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with , the singer was so annoying . their performance in general was just really really bad , i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die . they kept playing more and more songs , more than all the other bands , it was like a nightmare that would n't end . her voice is annoying , no range or style whatsoever , the music has nothing going for it . if u 're into courtney love and all that crud , u may like this , otherwise bail on this one
once again , too bad zero ratings are n't allowed . this movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer . the fact that the `` heroine '' sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling . she has her `` individuality '' and that 's about it . george harrison 's song `` i me mine '' should have been playing in the background at that point . blecch
i have read this book , mr . moon 's & quot ; divide and quit & quot ; , mr. khosla 's work , & quot ; stern reckoning & quot ; amongst others on the subject of the partition . ms. butalia 's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy , that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one 's thoughts and mindset . almost a diatribe , if i may . i will agree with what john_galt_who has written . i think he has hit the nail on the head . i did not consider this book worth either the money or the time
looks great but do n't get trusted , this is the worst killer shark film ever ! the shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like <NUM> people and that 's it . so please do n't see this movie i 'm warning you
pavarotti has a short but excellent repertoire that belongs in & quot ; classical music & quot ; ( e.g . fille du regiment ) , however <NUM> % of his recordings belong in popular music . amazon folks , please get your act straight on this guy and his other two tenor friends
do n't waste your money on this one ! a vast majority of the websites are no longer valid . the author really needs to issue a revised edition . it is rather unfortunate too because it it put together so well and in a easy to use format ... it just needs a refresher edition
this is the woooooooooooorst barbie movie i have seen in my life.it really stinks ! ! ! i also don ` t like barbie and the magic of pegasus , but i don ` t hate it as much as i hate swan lake . barbie movies i like : -the princess and the pauper ( * * * * * ) <NUM> stars -rapunzel ( * * * * * ) <NUM> stars -the nutcracker ( * * * * . ) <NUM> stars -fairytopia ( * * * * . ) <NUM> stars barbie movies i really don ` t like : -swan lake ( ..... ) <NUM> stars -the magic of pegasus ( * .... ) <NUM> star barbie movies i would like to see : -barbie diaries ( * * * * * ) <NUM> stars -barbie mermaidia ( * * * * . ) <NUM> stars the upcoming barbie movie : -barbie in the <NUM> dancing princesses i hope it will be good.not baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad as swan lake ! anyway ... barbie of swan lake stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinks ! ! ! ! really stiiiiiiiiiiinks ! ! ! i don ` t like the music.some of the people in the hate reviews says that music ws scary.it ` s not scary to me but i don ` t like it ! ooh anyway ... that ` s my opinion ! !
js concert was the most boring thing i have ever seen on dvd ! my cat was more interested in watching it then i was , and that was only because of jessica 's frilly costumes ! the sound system stank ! i was expecting her voice to echo like crazy . all of jessica 's songs were about expressing her love for nick . this dvd is so boring i 'm falling asleep just trying to figure out what to say about it . oh yeah ... her vocals were too breathy , that pink thing she wore looked like a flamingo caught in a shredder , and she should have left take my breath away alone ! nick did n't take her breath away she took his when she decided to walk out of their marriage ! nick will be siniging i 'm taking half away ! , and jessica will be singing i should have prenup
whew ! after reading other reviewer 's remarks , i 'm glad to see i was not the only one who thought this movie was crap . the cinematography is great , and the look ( art direction ) is authentic . i too had trouble following the double-storyline . just when i started to get interested in the modern-day story , the action cut back to the past . i do n't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what . i have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories . none of those were this boring . by the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders , you really do n't care anymore . and i do n't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline . in terms of casting , i have to agree with the other reviewers : why cast two british actress as the modern-day leads . to me , the character of jean should 've been played with either an american actress ( or at least a british or australian actress with an american accent ) instead of catherine mccormick . i also could n't begin to identify with the character . she seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it ( unless that 's the point ) . sean penn sits around and broods as her husband , a has-been poet . josh lucas and elizabeth hurley ( as sean penn 's brother and the brother 's girlfriend ) really do n't have much to do except add some eye candy ( josh for the ladies , and elizabeth for the guys , and believe me , i kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top ) . some say josh lucas 's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role ; i say he has nothing to work with : the character is just there to steer the boat and give hurley backrubs . he has no real personality quirks and lucas works best when he plays someone who 's a bit flawed ( he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles do n't suit him ) . sean penn , on the other hand , looks like he 's sleepwalking through half the movie . his alcoholic poet seems more like he 's stoned on prozac ; there 's no passion , even when he quotes dylan thomas . i think this was a miscasting ; he 's not sympathetic either . ( spoiler alert : his character 's fate during the storm is almost deserved ; one can not feel sympathy for him . ) the story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks , one does n't hold interest . sarah polley is a good actress , but her moping around -- `` oh , i 'm stuck in a loveless marriage , and i really want to sleep with my brother again , '' attitude gets old . yes , dear viewers , i gave away another spoiler : incest . the other actors that play in the murder mystery story ( aside from polley and the great ciaran hinds as the wrongly accused murderer ) are all scandinavian and i 've never heard of any of them before . they do a good job with the material they 're given , but it 's hard to connect with them as well . perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings . once was enough for me . perhaps you also need to read the original anita shreve novel before you watch it . if so , i understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation . this may be its biggest flaw : novels can be cinematic in their themes , imagery and their dialogue ; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories . it also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines , it 's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it , when the action gets confusing .
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction . if thoughts are that powerful , they need to be resrained earlier . i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive . logic can be quite painful when left alone , but sometimes it has to be
first , let me state that i have read hundreds of books and have never written a bad review . this book is an exception . i purchased this book hoping to read facts regarding women on plantations . i was disppointed as this book is based mainly on the writer 's view versus historical facts . the book covers the period of 1780-1835 . however , the author on multiple occasions refers to the civil war period . too much `` bouncing '' around throughout the years . yes , she does quote portions of historical letters but i felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer 's point of view without actual facts cited . the writer 's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors , which she refers to frequently in the book , are deplorable . why mention them at all . it only makes one want to read the books that she things so little of . harsh ... yes perhaps this review is harsh . bottom line , i read the book and would not recommend it as good factual reading .
this comic is so stupid . when you boil it down , it 's nothing but `` white people do this , and black people do this '' jokes with `` bush is stupid ! '' thrown into the mix . this is like an officially licensed webcomic . not worth the money , or time to read it . and despite it 's occaisional message against racism , the jokes are usually racist . people who will enjoy this book are those who are too lazy to read a real boo
unfortunately , i was made to watch this film in a french class i took . while i could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate , it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character 's face . it was honestly one of the most boring films i have ever seen . it 's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters ' faces .
first of all , decca engineers insist on to differentiate `` their '' scholl 's voice from that more sweet , resounding previous harmonia mundi cd 's like bach cantatas solo , english folksongs and so on where it was a pleasure to hear this singer.even orchestra bizantina could be better recorded ; maybe milano auditorium has n't fine acoustics.however , the same happens on `` heroes '' and `` banquett '' .in this senesino combo just here , scholl 's voice sounds rough and unpleasant , the top of his range excessive and satured.second of all , in my opinion , opera is n't his confort zone for good.i believe that as a chorister boy , he grew up in that german musical territory singing sacred music by buxtehude , bach , where he did his best on recording.in this cd , i heard his worse ; a rugged vocalization plentiful in ha-ha-ha , absolutely abusive that seems dreadful to me ( `` al lampo dell'armi '' for instance ) , his vocal colours sounding like croacks sometimes , incongruous and dramatically unfruitful attempt to perform repertoire previously recorded by himself like it was a new , fresh one ( `` dove sei '' , '' aure , deh , ... '' ) .i 'm sorry ; i know scholl fans are very zealous on their idol but i have heard much better senesinos by derek lee ragin , daniels , minter , gall and so on .
i love jazz , really . but candidly speaking , bud powell 's frog croaking vocalizations ruin just about every damn piece of music he 's ever been involved with ! i just want to strangle him whenever he starts that crap in one of his tunes . why did he feel the need to do that ? did n't he realize he was destroying his music as he recorded it ? i 'm sorry to offend folks , but an idiot powell was , a complete idiot . he blew it
like `` jurassic park '' , this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters . my reasons for such an accusation : <NUM> . crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts . and while these can be quite interesting , they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline ( dan brown , for instance , is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity ) . as a result , the book comes off as slow and stumbling . <NUM> . the plot is n't all that interesting to begin with . ( vengeful gorillas ? talking gorillas ? misanthropic gorillas ? come on . ) <NUM> . the book 's ending is utterly terrible . <NUM> . cricton 's writing is weak , and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing . sorry , michael , but this book just did n't do it for me
after pretty much laughing my ( ... ) off while watching `` the best of will ferrell '' , i expected to do the same with `` the best of will ferrell - volume <NUM> '' . however , when i watched it on tv in july , i was extremely disappointed . outside of a few sketches , i hardly uttered a chuckle . however , when i saw this dvd a few weeks ago , i knew i had to buy it , thinking i might change my opinion . needless to say , it remained the same . `` the best of will ferrell - volume <NUM> '' is supposed to include sketches featuring some of will 's lesser known recurring characters that failed to make it on the ( <NUM> million times funnier ) first volume , including rude and incompetent obstertrician dr. beamen , hank of bill braskie 's buddies '' , and ted brogan '' , the <NUM> - year - old baby . also there are some sketches that feature non - recurring bits . none of these sketches are funny . however , there are a few funny sketches . they are the opening bush sequence , the famed `` wake up and smile '' , `` lovers '' ( though there 's another version of this sketch with the same characters on volume one except it 's with jimmy fallon and drew barrymore and it 's much funnier ) , `` red ships of spain '' ( with will doing his robert goulet impression ) , and `` inside the actors studio '' with kate hudson as drew barrymore ( though the one with alec baldwin as charles nelson reilly on the first edition was much funnier ) . the only other watchable sketch is `` janet reno 's dance party '' , which really only catches fire when she beats up mayor rudolph giulianni . it 's pretty good , but will impersonated reno <NUM> times , so there are probably better janet reno sketches out there . also , there are many much more funnier characters that did n't appear or only appeared briefly on the first volume that without a doubt should have been included here . i 'm talking about frank henderson ( from the `` get off the shed '' bit ) , david leary ( from `` dog show '' ) , tom wilkinson ( from `` morning latte '' ) , sean patrick flannery ( from the mary katherine gallagher sketches ) , baron nocturna ( from `` goth talk '' ) , don west ( from the `` shopping at home '' sketches ) , and his ted kaczynski and neil diamond ( where 's `` storytellers '' ) impressions . and why not include more culps , spartans , roxbury , `` jeopardy ! `` , harry caray and saddam hussein sketches ? yeah , they were on volume one , but they were truly will 's best ! and as a final gripe , they could have given us at least one of the bush/gore presidential debates sketches . overall , you can say this is a complete abomination , but it is tempting . buy at your own risk and hope that volume three comes out soon and it 's much , much better than this dvd
my husband has a theory that danielle steel has a dart board and each circle surrounding the center is labeled either , falls in love , loses family member , has death of loved-one , fights for life of herself or loved one , loses partner , business or spouse . he feels when she is at a loss she justs throws off a dart and whatever she hits becomes the outline for her next book . i have been a loyal fan for many many years and take his kidding with a smile and secretly pray he 's not right . this book proved me wrong and he was right all these years . it was so obvious from the first few pages what was happening that i was certain i had read this story before somewhere . after having waited long time to get this book from my local library i was so disappointed that it was so poorly written and so badly not thought through i could n't even read it completely , but skipped sections to finish it , knowing what was going to happen before i got to it .
first , fix the date in the description amazon ! ! ! ! ! in spite of loopy 's warning i ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory . wrong ! i received the same <NUM> book and when i complained to amazon they sent me a replacement . another <NUM> book . while the information in the book appears good , it 's describing conditions over <NUM> years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream . the clark fork , for example , is described as `` teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin . '' my online research has indicated the clark fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide i would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip . if this book were up to date i would give it at least <NUM> stars . but considering the age i would recommend you pass and search for other sources
filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material . this book , although nice on the application side , falls short when the going starts to get rough . this book has chapters that are not even worth reading , like the chapter on eigenvectors and linear transformations . in general , the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems ( a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory english saying `` blah , blah , as we saw previously , blah , blah , blah . '' if you doubt me , do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink , later ) . is that what you want ? the serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books . i 'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour . i 'm just saying explanations are lacking . a reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text , and <NUM> % are done by rote . this is correct . the `` hard '' problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction . another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians . i feel this is correct too . applied mathematics students should also avoid this book . i do n't think this book prepares you for `` the next level '' , where you 'll be working with real problems . i do n't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra , and i do n't think there 's nearly enough matrix theory here . also , i think the book has that american textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections . it 's not a good writing style for my taste . it 's kind of like a calculus book . they lie to you first , and then they teach you `` advanced calculus '' and `` analysis . '' personally , i do n't like that approach , because i think it 's a time waster . and , you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate ( this is true for engineering students at my institution ) . quickly immerse yourself in `` matrix analysis and applied linear algebra '' by c. d. meyer and avoid this book ; or , another great book ( and everybody says so , because it is ) , gilbert strang 's `` linear algebra and its applications . '' the virtues i see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications `` appetizers . '' all in all , though , it 'll do you more harm than good . students who enjoyed this book have probably have n't read any other . this review refers to the 2nd edition
wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously have n't heard this trash . sheesh , where do i even begin ? you thought fiddy was bad ? how about chingy ? lil jon ? nope , they 're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh . these guys are a disgrace to the black race , aaron mcgruder is totally right ( creator of the boondocks ) if martin luther king jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of black america , perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point . afterall it was chris rock that said , `` there are black people and there 's n * * * ers ! '' then everyone in the audience laughed their * sses off because it 's true . unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group . do n't give me that rubbish on how it 's just the music , no way folks , this goes far beyond the music itself . this is a reflection of the sad state our society is in . ok people you want to talk about the actual music ? we shall then , but these cliched annoying 'beats ' lack so much substance that i 'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music ' . the lyrics ? they bring new meaning to the word stupid . so there you have it , this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them ( the aforementioned rap degenerates ) they really take the cake for retards of the decade when we talk about `` i love the '00s '' in <NUM> years . by the way check out the boondocks , it 's a great comic-turned-cartoon , it 's very fresh and unique
i ordered this for my father , and according to him , there was only one disk in the package . very disappointing . he did n't want to bother with sending it back .
i 'm sorry , i love gina gershon and i was looking forward to watching this movie since i do like action films . but this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick . i was n't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show . the basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an aryan militia becomes prominent nearby . it starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate , and the white boys in the militia do n't like that . * gasp , i never would have guessed * main character kicks everyone 's behind , gets the girl , acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any b flick action film . your time could be better spent watching paint dry . or if you 're desperate for something like this then watch universal soldier , at least it was funny
this album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating , and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere . pacific is simple in its structure ; and for the most part is listenable . at timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums , but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that 's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge . overall i 'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach , or some other equally applicable deviation . the group includes lucas jensen , clay , and howard hudson , and is currently playing shows to support the release . visit their website and show the band some support at http : //www.thewarmsupercomputer.com . content copyright www.maximumink.co
sad to say this book is an embarrassment to both psychiatry and the christian faith . however , neither should be blamed for the nonsense of a man who claims to represent both . there is so much wrong with this book that it is n't worth getting into . i find it highly ironic , though , that peck is guilty of the same grievous sin and `` malpractice '' as the father of his character jersey . jersey 's father was a psychologist ( not an m.d . ) , but use to put on a physician 's coat when seeing patients . peck saw this as highly offensive and evil . yet he , a psychiatrist , had no qualms about pretending to be an exorcist and perhaps causing severe psychological , not to mention spiritual damage to his `` patients . '' if this book has any merit it lies in its ability to be a good case study on how not to practice psychiatry . from reading his books i ca n't help but get the feeling that while peck sincerely wanted to help people he was too caught up in himself . perhaps the enormous early success he enjoyed from `` people of the lie '' did a trip on his mind . i hope he and all those he treated can find healing . dominus custodit te ab omni malo : custodiat animam tuam dominus .
before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral- & quot ; forest of equilibrium & quot ; and winter - & quot ; into darkness & quot ; which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is
we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
do n't get me wrong . i love bill murray and i 'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he 's deserved . but these wes anderson `` comedies '' are just lame . rushmore started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out . the royal tenenbaums was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story ( it felt like two-hours even if it was n't ) . and now the life aquatic . all of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts . i do n't think there 's been a good comedy since a fish called wanda in <NUM> ( although parts of the big lebowski are hilarious ) so i do n't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies . most stink . maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy . that might explain the glowing reviews here . although anderson 's films are competently made , they feel stuffy and pretentious . humorless . i chuckled once per hour . not a good average . i do n't think this movie ever makes up its mind . and i 'm so sick of owen wilson that i wish hollywood would give him a paid vacation . does he have to be in every single movie ever made
the lead singer 's song delivery is quite mopey . the keyboard solos are rather pedestrian , but was way ahead of it 's time , it 's match for match with `` free jazz '' and japanese noise . the guitarist is quite talented and to be honest , the rest of the band weighs down his true potential . the song `` riders in the storm '' is a good exhibit a on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates
overall , i was not impressed by this rambling and disjointed book although ferguson makes some interesting points . the book is background to a british tv series involving ferguson , and it suffers very much from being written for that format . his basic argument is that the great wars of the 20th century tore apart the great multi-ethnic empires of great britain , russia , turkey , austria-hungary , and germany , unleashed ethnic tensions the empires had contained . this , he explains , is the reason for a lot of the violence of the century , as new nation states sorted out their ethnic identities with large-scale organized violence following . this is , indeed , a very fertile field and ferguson unearths the mass graves with relish . we are presented with the familiar parade of horribles -- kaiser bill , hitler , stalin , pol pot , etc. , and a huge section on the pogroms against the jews in central europe and the nazi extermination efforts . the narrative tends to jump around quite a bit , something i would attribute to the tv format of keeping viewers interested , but it 's a little disconcerting for armchair readers . but in the end , ferguson is unconvincing . i do n't think he has fully thought through his thesis here . unexplored is the question of why some 20th century wars of liberation , for example ireland 's , had low death rates , while the establishment of others like turkey were so murderous . there were bitter ancient ethnic and religious issues in both ireland and turkey , and yet both took different routes . also ignored are instances where threatened ethnic wars were largely averted , as in the case of canada after the british empire collapsed , and indonesia after the dutch withdrew . i found him also fighting a straw man . he beats down the theory that the wars involved class conflict , and insists ethnic divisions are more significant in explaining the carnage than class . perhaps soviet historians presented this view , but i thought <NUM> resolved the debate about marxist interpretations of history . which brings up a final point . ferguson muses about why the last decade of the 20th century should be so quiet , compared to all that happened . i might think that the collapse of the soviet empire resolved the last issue of the wars of the 20th century by declaring another big loser .
i love leslie nielsen , but this movie is not funny . his better movies are wrongfully accused and the naked gun movies
the most untalented producer in the business . honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit . the rest of this is trash . especially those chickenheads total . and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass . dont give this bum anymore money , just listen to biggies two gems and `` f '' the rest
wow . i read this book a few days ago , and definitely have my own opinion on it . i thought i would come here and see what other folks are saying , and i 'm not altogether surprised . the first thing that continually surprises me when i read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is , in fact , well-written , if not even brilliant . there is , of course , no accounting for taste . what disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship ( which suggests a lack in either education or practice ) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views . i urge those of you that see bush as a righteous man to please `` read around . '' there are , obviously , dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like god and george w. bush will not even acknowlege , much less discuss , defend , or justify . to ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed . while i do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people , i am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts , or at least allows them to be performed , that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose . read other books and you will see . one subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil . i am not supporting them or denouncing our own , but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others . labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting , but that they fight simply to overcome those who `` love freedom . '' this is from page <NUM> of this very book , ( a quote from phyllis wheatley ) `` in every human breast , god has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom . '' here 's a 'revolutionary ' thought : everybody loves and wants freedom . if people are fighting they are fighting for freedom , we simply must ask one question : freedom from what ? read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question . also , see if you can discover , honestly and objectively , the freedoms that we are currently fighting for . another huge bother for me in this book is that kengor refers to texas as the largest state in the nation . it 's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement . another horrific , to my mind , thought is that bush , and lots of his followers , truly believes that god wants him to be president . a megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an `` i 'm on a mission from god '' world view scares the hell out of me .
many reviewers and critics said it best ... what do you do when the `` hero '' of the film ( ethan hawke ) is a complete a -- -hole , winona ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give ed wood , jr. a run for his money , and stiller , who is supposed to be the bad guy , actually is n't that bad of a human being ? and winona 's friends are the smarmy , arrogant , generation x punks who think they know everything ( when the reality is ( forgive the pun ) they do n't know jack ) . past generations would quote tolstoy and shakespeare , generation x quotes tv commercials , scooby doo cartoons , star wars , and bad sitcoms . generation x is probably the most insincere generation ever , detaching themselves and calling themselves `` ironic '' , when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism . is this film an accurate portrayal of them ? yes , in some ways . is the film worth watching ? yeah , at least once . stiller gives a decent performance , it 's nicely shot , and garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth . this is probably due to the fact that garofalo actually has some substance herself , as opposed to the character she plays . check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film .
dude ? ! ? ! what happened , when i heard about a new zombie cd i was like o yea ! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like wtf ? ? what happened to hellbilly and sinister kind of music ? ? i dont know what happened but , i 'll admit theres a few decent songs like let it all bleed out and the scorpion sleeps , but wtf ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
this would never have been published as a first novel . i had read and loved earlier books by jeanne dams and was looking forward to reading this book . but the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist , young helda , unbelievable and not very likeable . you had to do more than suspend disbelief with this book , since everything about the book was so improbable
i was shocked to see that maurice white had a hand in this misinterpretations of earth wind and fire 's classic songs . this cd was to launch or re-launch the stax label . its too bad the label did not launch with more orginal artists and compositions . while you may like the arrangements of the elements ' compositions , i could not get through this effort . the originals suit me just fine .
in the film commentary , director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying , ' i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it . ' ( that 's a paraphrase ) . and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad : the director did n't know what it was about . the weird , atonal score by gerald busby was an annoyance throughout , often drowning out the dialog . it 's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear , or in a psychological thriller , just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho . only in this film , the creepy music played on and on . that was it . no nuances , no alteration , no variance , no imagination . just the same creepy atonal 'psycho ' music all the time . duvall and spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal . lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time , and dream-like sequences , conveying ... mystery ? suspense ? drama what ? ah .. i got it , they convey confusion ! that 's it ! the writer/director was confused ! a waste of talent , and a waste of my time watching it . it is one of those films i watched thinking it had to get better . it did n't .
nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie
this is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college -- imitations of what 's on the shelf right now , only `` smarter , '' which really just means `` condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite marin county . '' but you should n't be surprised -- the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self-absorption ( even if she wants to pretend this is a novel : novels have plots , honey ) . bypass this and read some dorothy parker instea
i found this version at the library and decided to check it out . i was amazed at how bad it was . for one thing , they changed the story around which was bothersome . the singing is really bad , and i think the thing that that bothered me the most is the strange costumes ( tamino looks like an elf ! ) i also hated all the strange creatures that come out , instead of animals coming out when tamino plays his flute , they have people prancing out on stage dressed as who knows what . the whole thing was just horrible , costumes , the set , everything ... and a lot of times when the commentator is explaining a certain part , it 'll be playing a whole different aria ( or the wrong part of the aria . ) the whole thing is so chopped up , and the dvd is more blurry and grainy than i 've ever seen anything on dvd before . i would n't buy it or even waste yout time getting it from the library . you 're better off buying a real production on dvd of the magic flute for your kids , such as the one at the met with kathleen battle .
i am so tired of people like britney , who has no talent , she can not sing , making `` music '' . where has all the real talented artists gone ? instead of recording real horrible music , she should stay home eating like a cow , getting fatter by the minute with her useless `` wannabe '' husband and keep popping babies . her <NUM> minutes are up ! thank god ! can the real singers please come back
short , sweet , and to the point , i was extremely disappointed in this version of the mikado . i guess i should have known it would be a poor production when a new copy is selling for $ 1.62 . i learned a valuable , albiet inexpensive , lesson though . from now on i will read the reviews before making a purchase
i love vincent price and have many of his movies but this one i wish i had not bought . it is really stupid . it was one of his later movies that he probably made just to have work
i 'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here , but i can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst i 've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree . the concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing . the authors jump around constantly , use new terminology at times before introducing it , and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter . stylistically , the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep . the first sentence of the book is `` this is a book about signals and systems . '' sure , this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing , but trying to make sense of it when you do n't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge . after reading the chapters , we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us . i 've dealt with bad textbooks before , but this one tops them all . needless to say , it was very frustrating experience and i ca n't say i recommend this book
i know you 're excited , and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail , and you 're working on [ probably ] the biggest budget you 've ever had to work with , but please save the $ __.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead . then go to the library , and oogle over how many of these ridiculous cds they have for you to listen to for free . trust me , once you decide on your songs , you 'll never listen to the cd again
i bought this album thinking it would be good , because every review i read gave it <NUM> stars . so i thought `` why not ? '' and bought it . i put it in the cd player , and was immediately dissapointed . the first thing i noticed was how terrible the sound levels were . it sounds like it was recorded in my garage , everything is way over-saturated and the drums are mic 'd terribly . you ca n't even tell what 's going on half the time , which is n't saying much , because there is nothing very interesting happening in the guitars . so i listened a little longer , thinking `` it has to get better , maybe they 'll add some symphonic stuff or something , considering this was reviewed to be some sort of black metal masterpiece . '' i was wrong of course , as the first track remained pretty stagnant , as did the next , and the next track etc . assumed that the frontman must be a good singer , considering his howl is absolutely laughable . once again , bad sound levels come in to play here , even though not a whole lot could cover up how terrible this dude is . basically this album is not the black metal masterpiece it was hyped up to be . if you are into really bad prog metal with bad production , this album is for you . if you 're not , steer clear of this album . it was the biggest waste of money i made this year
this cd had the makings of a great recording . the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch , please record another one but leave popper at home.he 's full of a lot of things , but talent is n't one of them
i randomly chose to buy and listen to this cd because they are playing at coachella . it is n't good . it reminds me of stereolab but without talent . each song is more insipid and boring than the last . the music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine , irritating electonic blips , guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless . needless to say ... i do n't get it
even the avid `` trekie '' reader of the star trek science fiction novels , movies and television series must suspend disbelief , when he finds captain kirk saying `` beam me up , scotty . '' but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort , when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world-wide `` rapture . '' though the characters and their roles are fictitious , the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer . the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event , and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions . in the september/october <NUM> issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions . instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform . billy graham 's biography by strober notes that they criticized graham 's `` new evangelism '' for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems . yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the `` tribulation force '' or as exemplified by jerry falwell 's moral majority . they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations . mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the united nations . the u.s. statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially , while evangelicals and liberals - e.g . southern baptists , lutherans , presbyterians , methodists - and catholics are continuing their per capita declines . such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism 's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society . i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the `` left behind '' in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society , and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind . and in not just a few respects , they may be wise to do so . thomas j. hickey
i could give a long winded review on how bad this album is , but let me just say this ... radiohead is one of the few bands that i fell for all the hype about . what an idiot i was , i bought this cd and listened to it about <NUM> times trying to figure out what it was that i was missing . i finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever . the song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable . garbage folks that is all this amounts to . the most overated band of all time perhaps ? oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes i did n't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance , let me say ... it ahas all been done before . you just have to dig a little deeper than mtv and rolling stone magazine to find it . do n't believe the hype !
i 've read a lot of stephen king 's work , and loved most of it , but 'firestarter ' was a big letdown ! it 's not quite in the 'abomination ' category of 'from a buick <NUM> ' , but at least king could blame that one on his car accident . this one is probably only about as good as 'the tommyknockers . ' the premise is great , but once it gets away from 'andy and charlie on the run ' , and becomes 'the life story of tom rainbird ' , it goes downhill very quickly ! not to knock king too much , but as this books goes along , it seems obvious that sk was losing interest , either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason , and wanted to 'explore ' the supporting characters more ; or simply because this book came out fairly early in king 's career , when he was known to partake of certain 'substances ' which he later swore off ! worth reading only if you really want to read every sk novel . otherwise , just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one ( with the exception of the two mentioned above ) surpasses 'firestarter '
do n't read this book . i wish i had n't . it ruined pete rose in my eyes , not because of what others have said about him , but because of what rose said about himself . my grandpa was a huge fan of pete rose and once took me to meet him at riverfront stadium when i was around six . about the only thing i 'm glad for with this book is it did n't come out in my grandpa 's lifetime . we all make mistakes . we 're only human and that 's what humans do : we screw up . sometimes badly . i wish pete rose was in the hall of fame . i wish he was coaching the reds today . i wish most of all he 'd never placed a single bet on baseball . but as for pete , like i said up there , he still does n't get it , and i doubt he ever will . this book was a disappointment for many reasons . it did give me a nice look at pete 's career with the cincinati reds and took me back to my grandfather 's tales of how great the big red machine of the <NUM> 's was , but what was lacking in these <NUM> pages was contrition , and i think that was supposed to be what this book was about . the pete rose i met in my prison without bars , was a likable fellow , but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative , `` this is somebody else 's fault '' attitude that put me off and i 'm sure put a lot of others off , too . rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the <NUM> 's , a fact that surprised virtually no one , but instead of presenting an apology , or even a straightforward confession , rose comes across as a bitter man , still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing . he blames everyone from his friends and business associates , to major league baseball ( for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players ) . rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa , charlie hustle , the greatest baseball player of his era , left me feeling negative toward him , and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook . those were not images i had of the man before i started this book and i 'm sorry that 's how i felt when i was done . if i could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work , i 'd tell him : pete , you 've led an interesting sixty-plus years . you 're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field . you deserve to be in cooperstown . but your attempt to make amends with this book -- -probably your last chance , sadly -- is a dismal failure and a backset . i remember well the night you passed ty cobb 's all-time hitting record . i read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom i heard so much growing up . i now wish i did n't know 4/5ths of what i now do know about you . as i said starting out : do n't read this book
this is a joke right ? ! i honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because i figured nobody could be that bad on purpose . these british rappers are hiliarous , they basically talk over a beat and it does n't even rhyme half the time . i got given this cd for free and i still want some money back
i 'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie , but they never achieved it ! ! if it 's hentai or anime you are looking for this is not it ! ! there really is no plot or point to this movie . this is absolutlly the worst movie i have ever seen !
most people considered this the cheap trick & quot ; comeback & quot ; album . sixteen years after the fact i 'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a & quot ; go-back & quot ; album instead . while cheap trick did n't set the music world on fire with most of their <NUM> 's releases , it was n't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release & quot ; the doctor & quot ; that i actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums . on & quot ; the doctor & quot ; i searched but came up empty . & quot ; lap of luxury & quot ; is n't quite that bad , but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow . i 've made dozens of cheap trick compilations over the years and & quot ; let go & quot ; was the only song that i included off of lol . the thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the trick back to their rockin ' roots . well let me tell ya , this is far from it . i know . i remember
what a waste of my money , stories of sucesses and failures of a real estate salesman , how boring ! buy something else or save your money
let me just say , i 'm not a seattle scenester , i 'm not illiterate and i do n't like the lashes . sorry ! i found a copy of this ep in the used bin at my local record store so i thought i 'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks . needless to say it 's going back to the used bin . imitating the strokes and the killers is really played-out right now . what 's the point ? these songs are derivative with a capital `` d '' . the world does n't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what 's already out there . the music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really dumb ! it 's like reading a <NUM> year-old girl 's diary . even my friend said `` it sounds like these guys are about one year too late . '' the lashes are so derivative and unoriginal i almost suspect they were `` manufactured '' to be popular . absolutely soulless .
i purchased this years ago and tried to read it but found it hopeless . the style , mistakes and flat out omissions make this useless . wheelock 's latin is far better and worth the money for textbook as well as the workbook
loud , obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the hanna-barbera cartoon . after watching this film i realized that the legendary <NUM> 's mega-flop `` howard the duck '' was almost twenty years ahead of its time . there 's very little difference between scooby-doo ( and most of the other current films of this type ) and that classic bomb ! perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered `` sequel worthy '' . also , just to be fair to howard the duck , at least that movie had the visual appeal of lea thompson . if your idea of fun is bombastic , poorly produced special effects , a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you ! certainly worth checking out if you 're a fan of the scooby-doo character , but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back ! the sequel deserves the exact same review . -j
i give this cd one star , not because it is n't good , but , because it is the same stuff they have already sold once . i am a big blind melon fan . i was fortunate to see them live <NUM> times and they were great , but , when you can download songs like mother earth , whoa god , tickled pink , and rebirth . i have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff . the only people interested in this album would be melon fans . evident by how poorly nico did in sales , this is very disappointing , it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off . there is nothing new , so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old cd 's and play them , do n't buy this , unless you do n't own the albums . the surviving members should be ashamed of themselves
i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful `` supergroups '' . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $ uck . when damn yankees released their <NUM> debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their `` supergroup '' scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller -- -- '' why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . '' supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup
the planets seem to have a problem deciding what they ' l be . are they a band that puts a rock twist on classical ? are they a bloated chamber orchestra ? are they a rather sparse symphony ? what is on this album is a good example of mediocrity . if you want good poppy classical music , check out vanessa mae . if you want good classical music , look at the scores of albums arranged by truly great composers . the planets try hard and fall flat . perhaps in another couple of albums they 'll have found their voice , but it certainly is n't on classical graffit
who could like a band like the rolling stones ? they are not the world 's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but start me up and shattered . their new album is the most horrible cd i have ever heard . stay far away from that cd . get anything from the stones that contains start me up or shattered insted .
i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it 's release why ? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on hd or blueray or a new <NUM> disc dvd set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie ..
`` reefer madness '' ( originally `` tell your children '' ) was created to teach parents that it 's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids . through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of marihuana ( mike nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter j ) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin . we see firsthand that even teens who can quote shakespeare like nobody 's business can not escape its evils . here are some of the symptoms of casual marihuana use : - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street - playing the piano too fast - having sexual relations with people you do n't really like that much - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well - having no recollection of being framed for murder if your child has experienced any of these symptoms , he or she is a marihuana addict . the solution is simple : force them to watch `` reefer madness '' because if we do n't heed its warning , `` reefer madness <NUM> '' will be coming to a theater near you or you ... or you
i was extremely disappointed with this book . it was not what i expected and i was bored <NUM> % of the time
i have to contradict the other review . i thought it was shot fine , but the sound was not good . moe is a two guitar band and i believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other . on the dvd , al is real loud , but chuck 's guitar is almost completely inaudible . this is a real big disappointment to me . i really like moe , but i would not recomend this dvd except for those who have to have it . it 's a real shame
i am a huge fan of this series . this for the most part was a collection of the worst of the collection . wait until they put a better collection togather .
jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse . seriously , think about marc bolan trying to sound like a '50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like
there 's a ton of paper in this book , overboard , in my opinion . wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious . i 've taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information has n't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail . they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation . i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california
this dvd is fine for beginners who would like some stretching , but there is no weight loss aspect to it . i felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight
complaining , whinning , mumbling , beer drinking , bathtub soaking , unattractive alison and her overgrown , teenage hairstyled , beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter . the most horrible series i 've seen on tv , in the end alison seems to `` solve '' whatever the problem is but it 's not worth the watch . no one in my family enjoyes this show
this dvd gets only <NUM> stars because the 4:3 tv screen format of this dvd production is really ridiculous . but the movie is one of my favorites , number <NUM> on my all time best movies list . the feel of the movie is more like that of a typical <NUM> 's sci fi movie ( like 'andromeda ' ) than of a <NUM> 's movie . austere and unemotional ( like colossus himself ) , quietly and punctuously narrated , minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain , as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world . i like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens , led displays , printout terminals etc . really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the <NUM> 's . and captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings . attention ! spoiler ! the movie has no happy end , the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end . just as it is in d.f . jones ' novel 'colossus ' on which the movie is based . and that 's another reason why i like the movie so much - one of the few movies without a forseeable and boring happy ending . the absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending , by the way , contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer . this movie almost has the quality of a kubrick
this was n't a bad cd , but it was not what you typically think of when you think of manheim steamroller music . i was expecting electronica patriotic music . i got a kinda old trucker country sort of music . no wonder it 's so cheap compared to the other ms cds ..
i was disappointed in this book . i had started getting these books on cd from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few i listened to . i enjoy the author 's picturesque , almost poetic , descriptions of things . those descriptions were still there , but they did not connect well . the mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line , not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story . there is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats ' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line . i felt very let down at the end of this audio book
this recording is not meant as workout aid . the cadence is 'double-time ' ( equivalent to a 'jog ' ) not 'running . ' the numerous jody snippets ( and that is what they are ) on this and i would assume similar recordings are meant to fill a special niche in music ; that being the archiving of the military 's equivalent to sea chanties , road gang and field songs . they make hard , boring , repetitive work go easier . god knows pounding down a road for ten miles with a full ruck is a challenge physically and mentally . these recordings would be much more useful workout-wise if , rather than snippets , they were longer . there are a couple of dis though on this recording that have real talent ; good 'lyrics ' , good voices and a hell of a lot of character . as an aside ; my the military has certainly become pc since the <NUM> 's ! these jody 's are n't anything like the ones i recall from boot camp - with only one exception that pops to mind . ( my ' <NUM> star ' grade is for missing the mark as a workout aid . i 'd give it ' <NUM> stars ' for what i call it 's archival 'potential ' which could be improved substantially .
this is my first time in this forum i 've seen the film of the 2nd disc and i found the copy ... not only bad but unnoticeable as a miracle the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions . it is possible that fox home video have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc . if this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist . i choose the first option . are you so kind -via fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ? yours r
galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named dan the automator . dan the automator took an amazing , explosive , quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had . i 'm sure these songs sound good live , that is without dan the automator 's overproduction and mixing ( drum machines over stanton moore ? for shame ! the horror ! ) . the album itself is flat except for a few high points - `` paint '' is good , `` the beast '' is funky enough , `` never called you crazy '' is good , and `` all behind you now '' is a great song , or would be live . that 's about it . the rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring , and considering the amazing amount of talent dan the automator had to work with in galactic that 's a crime . crazyhorse mongoose and late for the future are both far superior records
the presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed , making it difficult to understand . examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated . as someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area , i found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information . not a good choice if you are a novice . too bad i could not give it zero stars
you have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on this item.i am sorry i can not go over <NUM> stars as unfortunately there is a defect on last track of the record , precisely on the song `` the last rose of summer '' .anyhow i intend to buy other deanna durbin 's records as i enjoy very much her voice , but unfortunately the wallet is empty now . thanks for all your help on trying to find `` shane : a tribute to victor young '' but no euccess . i will try to buy another item later .
ok , this movie is for either black people , or white woman . then , you may enjoy it . this is soo silly and corny i want my money back . interesting idea , but ... no thanks . lo
okay , the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen , but i like the actors ( especially ben 's best man ) so i was friendly with this movie for the most part . i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot , such as ... why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones ? or at least , why do n't they use them ? oh no , much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $ <NUM> to buy a car to drive to nc . i did n't even mind the fact that the whole `` we 're married and my husband 's a doctor . '' charade was so predictable . oh gee , he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people . d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and `` dr. holmes '' might have to step up ? and uh , they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gon na get busted ? what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending . it was obviously supposed to be a surprise ( and it was ) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience . i felt cheated . i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben , and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah 's little boy and all that . i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget , i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other . the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they 're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen . right up to the last moment , we think he 's breaking it off with bridget . instead , what the heck let 's just go ahead and get married after all . huh ? he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane ! ! ! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back . this man obviously does n't have a clue what he wants in life , and i 'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after ? not only that , but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously ? it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us `` do n't do it ! '' and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage , aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway . it 's just marriage . it 's romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after ! it 's been my experience , when things are n't feeling just right as you approach that wedding , turn and run . the last thing you should do is close your eyes , grab your balls and take the leap
i read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security . it does not . in fact , it glosses over the key , overriding issue : that the so-called `` social security trust fund '' does not in fact exist . the claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an iou that the government writes to itself . the book spends all of one paragraph ( see page <NUM> ) on this critical issue , suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds , rather than government bonds , and concluding , `` it is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund 's portfolio should make any difference . '' i just about threw the book across the room at that point ! in other words , the authors see no difference between a fund backed by real assets that can simply be sold and a fund that will require raising taxes or additional borrowing on an enormous scale
i enjoy jackie chan 's films but this was an exception . it would have been fine to have cast this movie with just jackie chan and fann wong . these two actors were great as a team . adding owen wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot . when he was n't tedious , wilson was boring . why was he even cast in this film ? this was a movie i wo n't be in a hurry to see again
modest mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album . i , however , can not find them . this is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable . it comes out of the speakers , into your ears and then disappears . all of the previous mm releases , and i 've heard , loved and lived them all , are unique , enduring and beloved pieces of music ; this record is not of that ilk . and that 's a real shame , mm are one of the finest bands of the past <NUM> or <NUM> years , right up there with the likes of ween , built to spill and all of the jagjaguwar bands . oh well , a rare miss . i 'm still a huge fan , still gon na go see them whenever the tour rolls around ( definately go see them live , when isaac is n't too drunk , the shows can be legendary ) , still gon na love the freak rock phenomena that is modest mouse , just ca n't seem to get behind this release .
`` philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up , 'what 's that ? ' '' - ludwig wittgenstein imagine spending an hour and a half with a teenage version of the sphynx from `` mystery men , '' but without mr . furious as a foil . instead , there 's the somewhat compassionate , somewhat opportunistic pearl madison , played by don cheadle . sometimes i was n't sure if cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted , or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen . the film is similar to `` mystery men '' in a way , though ; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew , and a cast of some of my favorite actors ( including kevin spacey -- also one of the film 's prodcuers ) and put them in one of the most frustrating films i 've ever sat through . i guess i 'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey , disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors . i would n't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany , but it does n't . when the credits rolled , the only thing i was thinking about was a guy who 'd stabbed his girlfriend 's retarded brother , and writer/director matthew hoge asking , `` what 's that ? '' i may as well have watched `` elephant '' again . if exploring suburban angst is your thing , you might like this film . there are better cooked stories out there , though . i watched larry clark 's `` ken park '' afterward , which was like `` the united states of leland '' in a less wealthy neighborhood . both films were depressing , but i felt so gross after i watched `` ken park '' i promptly returned it to the video store , showered and cleaned my whole apartment . at least i was shocked into action . `` the united states of leland '' just had me crawling back into bed . the soundtrack is okay . the score is by sunny day real estate 's jeremy enigk . jena malone shoots up heroin to the pixies , and there 's a dot allison song i like in the credits that i 'd forgotten about . no cd was released .
i found this movie somewhat entertaining , although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun . unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention , and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting , makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience . nevertheless , the film is about a whole host of young people , dressed up and heading for a party ( ostensibly martha plimpton 's party ) , but they never quite make it there . plimpton , someone i never really cared for , is actually rather funny in this role , and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party ( and her idol , elvis costello ) . christina ricci and gaby hoffman are both quite funny ; courtney love , paul rudd and janeane garofalo are also quite a trio . overall this is light comedy ; nothing special but still worth the effort .
like most indie gay themed movies , `` trick '' had quite a bit of buzz around it . a terrific movie with tori spelling ! how could i not love it ? i loved `` die mommy , die ! `` , `` girls will be girls '' , and `` jeffrey '' . so i got ta love this too , right ? right ? ? i found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality . a hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb ? uh ... why ? ? so they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy . and then it 's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans . as much as i ca n't stand tori spelling 's `` acting '' , she 's the only performer not phoning it in . ( maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots ? ) what little life there is in this movie , it owes it to her . the problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking . the `` sizzling '' dancer looked like bored monkey . and the soft , sensitive gabriel has no personality . why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery . i guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy ( which would n't be too much of an effort for him ) , there would n't be much of a movie . a cameo by miss coco peru is a nice treat . but she 's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish , you 'd think she was in a different movie . high expectations , very low gratification . honestly , skip it
i 've been a beastie boys fan since i was in <NUM> years old . i played the cassette version of license to ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones . and until a while ago i would maintain to anyone that every beastie boys album was great , cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop 's most talented artists . ( get to the point . i know , i know . ) but i had never really owned `` hello nasty ' myself . it was the only one of their albums i had n't picked upon release . until recently . now , upon closer inspection reveals that there really is n't a stand out track on the whole album . `` intergalactic , '' `` body movin ' '' and `` super disco breakin ' '' may have been pseudo hits but they do n't really stand out from the rest of the album , which feels like mostly filler . decent filler , though . there are a few stinkers : `` song for the man '' ( it 's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting , but this track is utterly skippable ) and dedication ( following house of pain 's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to ) . like their previous two lps , there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album . but in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed . i listened to it <NUM> times in a row while at work an could n't really discern any standout track . but for what it 's worth , i was n't annoyed . all in all it 's cool to hear the b-boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound , but it 's not mind blowing . i 'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their cds . it 's certainly wo n't detract from your collection and there will be a time you 'll want to listen to it . but i would n't expect to find yourself picking it over paul 's boutique , check your head or even to the <NUM> boroughs ( awesome , by the way ) for that matter .
i should first say that i have not watched the series , but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so . i am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime 's i have enjoyed include dragon ball z , outlaw star , cow boy bebop and ninja scroll . if you have only seen <NUM> movies in your life time and the other one was `` big top pee-wee '' , then maybe ( and i stress maybe ) i could understand a <NUM> star review . if you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you . if you are <NUM> years old you might be impressed with this . however if you expect depth of character , story evolution and strong plot , skip this . in a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/die , what ever , so she disappears and shows up in gaea as the wing goddess . two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world . the girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides ; the good guys get it the end . believe me when i say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one . the good : a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good . the bad : the tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized . the characters are n't developed at all so you ca n't really bring your self to care about them , or want to pay attention to them . the movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into <NUM> minutes and they failed miserably . i considered turning this off several time but felt that i should finish and form a complete opinion about it . well i have and it aint good .
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book . the book was anything but funny . i read about half , up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore . i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me . the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a <NUM> yr. old was just sick . i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it . i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick , mentally ill characters . i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
i can see why i saw the cassette version of this album in $ 1.99 bins in the '90s . chicago 's 21st album was the worst album to me , easily the worst i 've heard from them . the album sounds so boring , and the performances sound so uninspiring . even the diane warren-written song sounds lousy , typical of her sappy ballad pap ! there 's not one memorable song on here , compared to classics like if you leave me now , love me tomorrow or others . do n't hear a lot of their famous horns , only keyboards and pop songs . and ron nevison produced this overproduced , overwrought fluff ? if chicago , with their extensive catalog , even thinks about performing one song from this album live , you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions . they are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in <NUM> !
featuring george clooney in an early role and maureen mccormick ( marcia marcia * marcia * brady ) in a comeback role , of sorts . also featuring a confusing metafictional plot , flat humor , and mostly bad acting . `` return '' is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies . there were several of them made during the eighties , most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for `` scream . '' none of them were as good as that movie , however , and `` return '' is no exception . although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there are n't enough of them to sustain the proceedings . if you watch just to see clooney and mccormick , be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early ( first , in fact ) , and despite a valiant effort mccormick 's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just does n't work
timeline is equivalent to a <NUM> cent taco . it 's an indulgent bit of junk food . timeline starts with a hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico - an intriguing idea , but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters . there are so many preposterous story elements that it 's just really difficult to take seriously . the story is ever-predictable and ludicrous . but , a <NUM> cent taco is worth the effort if you 're real hungry . go back and read andromeda strain .
this album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky , wacky , vivid personality of the first three galactic studio albums -- this is boring , flat and generic . is that stanton moore or a drum machine ? precede straight to garage a trois
just like the beatles , led zeppelin in most peoples eyes can do no wrong . sorry they can and this along with 'in through the outdoor ' is a band so full of self importance that they can serve up drivel like this and go platinum . i mean if any other band served up psuedo raggae ( d'yer maker ) , a funk james brown catastrophe ( the crunge ) , half finished songs ( dancing days , the ocean ) and a complete mish mash of ideas ( song remains the same ) it would be career suicide , not zeppelin though . i find their arrogance on this quite breathtaking . sure 'no quater ' and 'over the hills ' are great , but jesus does n't plants warblings and hippy drippy lyrics grate after a while . mind you he never was that great when compared with say paul rogers or ian gillan . the only saving grace with this is one of the greatest cover designs ever
the las vegas hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars jayne mansfield , mamie van buren and ferlin huskey . it appears to be a low budget film due to the photography , acting and settings . if you are a jayne or mamie fan , you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only . one highlight of the film is ferlin husky 's dream sequence of jayne singing `` that makes it . '' air time of jayne is very small . trivia : the siamese cat in the film , which jayne is holding , belonged to jayne 's friend may mann .
people have called chuck palahniuk 's writing many things : neo goth , modern goth. , new goth .... just dont get the idea that its all about whiny teenagers wearing black and griping about their latent vampire powers through bad poetry . no , palahniuk writes a different kind of book without all of the grim color and stale mythology , but he maintains the same themes : deterioration of the human condition , lack of moral fiber in today 's society , and the danker recesses of the human psyche . survivor tackles these topics with dazzling success and even enters a few new contenders to the mix such as commercialism , consumerism , and materialism . and this is all very old news to absolutely everybody but me , because chuck palahniuk has been around for a while now . it was only until recently i decided to pick up one of his paperbacks at the suggestion of my thugish top <NUM> myspace friend with too much facial hair and the clown tattoo . now , the way i like my stories told is with a good opening page , a large use of style , and a frugal use on the words . typically , i do n't read too many novels over <NUM> pages long . i have read plenty of longer books in the past , and all too often the only thing that separates a long story from a short one is that the author of a short book knows how to consolidate his word use and when to shut up . i 'm happy to say chuck palahniuk is such a writer by all counts . like any good stylist , his words flow like water straight from the page into your brain as the protagonist 's situation is fleshed out . survivor opens in the first person with a single man on a plane preparing to crash into the australian outback . he 's the last surviving member of a death cult who has made some strange decisions ... some better than others . at this time he is known the world over as a great spiritual leader , anti christ figure , and media mogul . there are many misconceptions about who he is and why he 's on said death plane , and he 'd like to set the record straight with the help of the jets black box . and from there we meet the narrator , tender branson , now in the past tense and living in humble times as a religious servant . members from his cult are killing themselves left and right , so the government gives branson his own psychotherapist and puts him on suicide watch . but branson is way past believing anything the church filled his mind with , and is more interested in telling other people to kill themselves after they find one of his phony suicide hotline numbers stuck to the side of a bus stop . he works for a couple that is very well off , and through his years of service has accumulated a library 's worth of useful housekeeping tips . the reader is educated , in detail , how to properly remove tear stains from pillow cases , urine from drapes , bullet holes in walls , and blood from fur coats . everyday situations are presented from the most warped of perspectives , and depending on the readers attitude , this may either be disturbing or refreshing . example : is learning that everyone you love will someday die from owning and loving upwards of six hundred pet goldfishes that have all died strike you as ironic , or sad ? are you intrigued by romances sparked in a cemetery , or turned off ? how about an over analytic shrink who convinces a hypochondriac that he has multiple problems in an attempt identify and cure just one ? clever , or whatever ? if you 're leaning towards the former with any of these , i might have an author to recommend . the characters are wonderful , and i took to them like a kid to a black van with candy . they have no need for convention . they have their own means of courtship , their own philosophies forged in solitude and cynicism , their own reasons for being attracted to someone else , and their own reasons for living and dying . but none of this is to say that everything is mentos and diet coke . while i 've never read another palahniuk book , i have seen fight club , a filmed adaptation if his book , and the voice of the protagonist in that story is very similar to the voice in this one . i could n't even read a sentence here without hearing edward norton 's voice , so similar were the personalities . both had a very sardonic tone towards everything modern and cynical one liners about the status quo . sloppy , but ill let it pass . did i mention that everything i just said only applies to the first half of the book ? the second half falls to pieces and leaves what could have been over arching themes or meanings in smouldering shambles . it 's a shame really . the first one hundred and fifty pages of survivor read very much like something i might very well write ten years from now , whereas the second half was more like the rough draft of something i could write now . character actions break the bank of plausibility and some scenes read like the author is trying to beat you over the head with some point that you just ca n't make out . for a book that started out so strong , i was left with a story that ultimately delivered nothing but the comical and poignant one liners it offered along the way . but hey , that 's life , is n't it ? well sure , its life , and its shaggy dog story telling too , but read both halves and tell me that something wasnt wasted from the first one . threads were coming together . if the book had stayed on course all the way through , i 'd be using this review to announce chuck palahniuk as my new favorite author , and maybe survivor as a favorite book . unfortunately , the second half was so lacking , i can barely recommend it as a whole . but there 's no reason that good writing should go to waste . use the first two chapters here to qualify yourself for all of palahniuk 's writings . you can do it in one sitting and be introduced to a wonderful mind and voice . from there you can hopscotch the palahniuk library with some assurance that everything will be a-ok in your tragedy of choice .
i completely understand and genuinely enjoy the chinese tradition of the lion dance . it is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer . but this movie , while building to the climactic end scene , has about <NUM> lions dancing at the end . all of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions , and all the while the viewer is left to be confused . clubfoot was a great addition , but enough with the lions ! ..
i hate to be the only one to say it . but this movie sucked . it 's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational . this movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful . the main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass . he manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in tuva , and in one instance hands an unsuspecting tuvan a joint . not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well . but its hard to take since paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed . but paul isnt the only ass of this documentary . he also has help from his friends of tuva and the filmers . if there is any value in watchings this piece of @ # * # its in what not to do when you visit other countries . seriously , one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there . from that character 's earlier appearences in the film , i would have to say that he would have deserved it . the only thing going for this movie is photage of acual tuvan 's singing . im so sorry they had to meet this guy . if you do decide to get this do n't forget to watch the interview with the directors . thats definately the best part . ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before , but this two are like charactures of them . if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing the journey of man
i watched ten minutes of beanie seagal trying to act and turned my dvd player off to read a book . i had to . i felt like i was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie . it looked so common i did n't even need to see the rest to tell you the end . i 'm willing to bet some people got shot , somebody got away with the crime , the police arrested beanie , and somebody 's mother was yelling at somebody . i do n't even care if i 'm right or wrong because regardless , i 'm not gon na finish watching this movie
blech . i hated this book . i read a lot of `` high drama '' books about teen issues as i work with teens who find themselves in this genre . unlike speak , or crank , or even cut , smack is a book that does n't connect with anyone . oh , and did i mention that it is boring ? do n't be misled by the other reviews , this insipid ride to unbelievable town does n't belong on your bookshelf
this book was a giant disappointment . very outdated - virtually no information on how to do this kind of investing electronically . a waste of $
do n't get me wrong . i 'm a raging hippie , who 's completely anti-war . and the lyrics on this album are great , and i love the cover of `` imagine '' by john lennon . but it seems that the actual desire to make good * music * fell to the back burner on this one . it 's not that the songs are bad per se , but they 're all fillers . it 's an entire album of fillers , with no really great songs to bring them up . overall , a disappointment , which is unfortunate , since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music . if you 're new to a perfect circle , pick one of the other albums . if you 're a veteran , sure , pick it up . but i 'd suggest listening to it on random with your other a perfect circle and tool cd 's
the material is fine . they cover most of the basics . however , i found the book to be extremely repetitious . they would often say the same thing over and over , page after page . it was comical really . the book could easily have been edited down to half its size . the construction of the book lacked any organization at all . i got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing . you could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book . i also had a problem with this abraham thing . it was kind of a turnoff really . i understand it 's a nice marketing angle , but enough already . i hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity . it 's too bad , really ; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick .
the way idle in his book badly treats anyone who saw his performance but did n't care for it shows how truly stuck up he is . everyone over <NUM> who watches his performances has to believe he 's every bit as great as he thinks he is or he gets negative about it . the drawing of idle as a lady is thankfully missing from the new paperback version . to the most recent reviewer here before me i say this . george harrison was part of the arguably biggest bunch of musicians in history ( the beatles ) . there was a moment in the <NUM> 's when almost every youngster in the us , england and australia between <NUM> and <NUM> years of age was into the beatles . there was never a moment when the pythons had such a fan following . comparisons between beatles and pythons are ridiculous . when idle 's time comes the only people who 'll blab about him in their own books would be the surviving pythons ( even carol cleveland )
this book is widely known as a classic , but the reader is left wondering `` why ? '' protagonist ( ca n't call him a hero ) of this novel is poor farmer ethan frome , who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife . he finds some `` excitement '' when mattie comes to visit , but again , the reader wonders why , because she 's vapid and uninteresting . to recap : we 're presented with characters that are n't the least bit likable to begin with , and turn pages eagerly waiting for the happy ending . instead , wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable . i feel like i wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book . why ? ? ?
too bad he ca n't sing as good as he looks . they say betty grable had the million dollar legs . he has the million dollar face [ circa : the <NUM> 's ] . if in doubt -- check out his second thru fifth albums as follows : second album -- back cover third album -- front cover fourth album -- back cover fifth album -- front cover . for the multi-million dollar face -- check the single record picture sleeve for `` runaround sue '' . it 's all in the face -- such as his . he has absolutely no talent at all -- other than his million-dollar face . hear : `` thoughts '' and `` love 's cruel '' from the fourth album [ these are solo -- no overdub ] and `` movie of you '' from the fifth album and `` when i think of you '' from the second and * third albums and these show what a producer can do with even the worst of them . the record companies is after only one thing -- the public 's money . take away his million dollar face and he 'd have nothing . it 's all in the face such as his million dollar face [ the <NUM> 's ] . his looks : $ $ $ $ $ $ his talent : none . for a photo of the multi-million dollar face -- see my image related to this item
as a lover of many types of music , this movie sparked my interest .... so i rented it . i found myself thinking throughout the movie `` i ca n't believe i 'm actually watching this . what a waste ! '' not only was the plot slow to the point of boring , but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that i ( as a grown woman ) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes . the small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story . also , please carefully consider before allowing children to watch ! ! i will never , under any circumstances watch this movie again . ( i want the reader to know that i am in no way a movie critic . i am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what i found to be a complete waste of an evening .
this movie is being described and sold as a comedy . it is not one . it has several funny lines , but the movie is more of a romantic drama . if you are looking for a comedy i do not recommend this at all
johnny depp is my wife 's favorite actor , so she bought the astronaut 's wife from a bargain dvd bin when she saw his face on the cover . the plot 's a little garbled , but it goes something like this : capt . alex streck ( nick cassavettes ) and commander spence armacost ( johnny depp ) go off on a space mission . when they come back , they 're different . some kind of weird sound -- it sounds like shrieking static -- was beamed into their bodies . what it is , exactly , we 're not sure . let 's call it `` a possessing entity . '' this malevolent entity wants to have children . twins , to be precise . so spence becomes fixated on <NUM> ) molesting his wife jillian ( charlize theron ) , and <NUM> ) building a spacecraft for two pilots . and then jillian finds out she 's pregnant ! and soon , streck dies of a seizure and his wife natalie ( donna murphy ) commits suicide with a toaster ! and it turns out she was pregnant ... with twins ! scary stuff , right ? well , no . it 's not scary . in fact , the film lingers and drags . struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic sherman reese ( joe morton ) . sherman is convinced something is wrong . he goes about it all the wrong way , of course , babbling on about aliens from outer space , harassing poor jillian , and basically ensuring that he 's a one note character , not an actually developed person . this movie is a blatant rip-off ( or homage , if you think it 's good ) of rosemary 's baby . this explains theron 's pageboy haircut , but does n't excuse anything else . the battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer 's patience . will she escape her husband ? will jillian abort the children ? does anyone care ? it 's hard to care . for much of the film , we 're not entirely convinced that there 's anything actually wrong with spence . he seems genuinely concerned with his wife ; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing , this would have made for an interesting twist ( maybe she was crazy all along ! ) . but it devolves pretty quickly . there 's lots of sexual symbolism , and not the good kind . yes folks , this is the first film i 've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with depp 's `` oh '' face ( fans of office space will know what i mean ) . is that symbolism or what ? finally , depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason . it turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it ( especially when angry ) , such that we 're not sure if spence really ever had an accent . would n't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him ? yeah , that would have been neat movie . rosemary 's baby was very much a product of its time . the astronaut 's wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects , but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond . everyone gets that the devil is evil incarnate and that you do n't want to have his baby . the astronaut 's wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad ... jillian 's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know . fortunately , depp and theron would go on to do much better works . alas , the astronaut 's wife serves as a reminder that you ca n't just swap out religion with aliens and assume it will be a great movie
in `` palindromes '' solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be . he 's great at pinpointing where it hurts , but i think i 'm ready to call the doctor . there 's a scene in preston sturges ' `` the lady eve '' where henry fonda and barbara stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship , and henry fonda is staring out over the water saying something like , `` i feel like i 've known you all my life . i keep meeting you , etc . '' `` palindromes '' stretches that idea over <NUM> minutes , using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses . when she 's finally successful , you 'll be mumbling to yourself , `` this is so wrong . this is so wrong . '' solondz reportedly wanted heather matarazzo to reprise her role as dawn weiner from `` welcome to the dollhouse '' for this film ; when she declined solondz had her character commit suicide .
i just reviewed the other cd and like i said its a waste of your money . save your money for something valueable
the pretentious film goer has never had a greater ally than lynne ramsay 's morvern callar . what is little more than a bland stew of typically successful indy film techniques ( hand-held shot , character-based , amoral , unique , hip , naked ) becomes an immenitely defensible , but truly awful film . to merely skim the surface : why morvern is touted as a study of progress , liberation , or self-discovery is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film ; indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack . although other indy film goers may crucify the non-believers , this sort of movie is equally disgusting as the bloated star-powered behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision . that sort , however , is only after our money . morvern caller is after something much more dangerous : our admiration . for more information on lynne ramsay 's film , see : `` no skin off my nose , '' a succesful , art-house play prominately featured in the fountainhead .
dancing on dangerous ground is best described as a ballet expressed through the medium of irish dance . the costuming is modern and the acts form a very cohesive story ( much more so than riverdance ) , but the superposition of romance , tragedy , and war on a dance invented for celebration seems ... contradictory at best . the performance is technically excellent , and for some , the military scenes alone will make the dvd worth it . but the irish legend - a tale of a first officer and a queen who betray their king not unlike lancelot and guinevere - has griana truncating her forms so as not to bounce too much during her lament , and both leads trying to express longing without breaking irish posture during their romance . in that sense , watching dancing on dangerous ground is kind of like admiring a painting of the sunset over a tropical beach done in glorious black and white . even if you think black and white photography is beautiful , and love sunsets and the tropics , you end up wishing that the painter had chosen to change either the subject , or the medium . the one place where medium and subject do work well is in the military scenes , where irish precision is put to amazing use ; then the watcher can feel the rhythm and the power conveyed , even through the tv screen . but in the scenes in between , i found myself craving a no-hold-barred energetic number that expressed the joy of irish dance ( like the ones which made riverdance famous ) , and wishing for the full upper-body expression of a ballet during some oddly stilted during laments and romantic scenes . as an irish dance piece it 's well executed , and as a ballet the costuming is inventive and the music beautiful , but there 's an odd quality to watching it . sometimes it gives the impression of muted color , sometimes of undersold majesty , but always there 's the feel that the passion , while * almost * there , is somehow still missing .
buy one of the other versions with special features . this is the older , first-generation dvd with no features . nothing . plus , this is a flipper disc ! a great movie worth owning .. just not this edition
like hayek 's road to serfdom , this book was written during the secon world war when keynes was busy crafting the post war peace . it is infused with the 1930s ' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the communist version more than the nazi/fascist version . keynes is indisputably the 2oth century 's most important economist but why does schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position # <NUM> ? i put it down to the same reason as marx ' theory of alienation gained such sway . as there was little else to salvage from marx ' writings , they hit on that to make him apear relevant . marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history . i see little relevant in his work which i feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction . unlike gary becker and other recipients of the nobel prize , schumpeter tackles big issues . but the big issues shrug him off . nothing here to ponder over
this is by far one of the worse things i 've ever heard . right up there with chingy or changy or whatever it is . they should be ashamed . it 's a miracle that can say `` laffy taffy '' and still show their faces in public . for shame for shame . for the record , d4l , to para-quote your own lyrics , no `` i ca n't do it it like you '' nor would i want to . i would never suck so bad . <NUM> star here it comes
for me , as an old superman reader , i found the movie story very hard to `` believe '' . the picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece , wish richard donner has this same techonolgy in <NUM> . why the story is so weak ? first , it is not logical for superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially lois ( and specially if their relation went to making love this time ) . second , the reason of this disappearing , and what a reason , he knew from sciencetes that his planet , krypton , might no be explode and there are some survivors , well , superman does n't need earth people to tell him about his planet , he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check , under the red sun radiations . and if we presume that he went for this reason , why it took him <NUM> years to come back ? , ....... no answer . third , clark kent was absance too , for the same period like superman , is it normal for lois not to doubt in this matter , we all know she is the all time person who always think that clark kent is superman , but now she even does n't care of saying hello to him ? ? ? ? fourth , why he need space ship to come back to earth ? we all know that under the yellow sun , he gain all his power back . more and more , i ca n't believe when he can carrie a whole island of kryptonite all this distance from earth to space , while he usually ca n't breath if he was under the radiation of the green kryptonite . well , this story suits children who are new to superman . i think they should contact people like alan moore and cary bates next time if they want to make superman movie .
yet another shakespeare adaptation ... but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out . romeo must kiss juliet . oh no , interracial sexuality ... too risky . a truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers
i do n't know alot about old movies , especially not silent film , or anything before the <NUM> 's , so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy . most of the shots were very long , repetitive , and boring . it was rare for a scene to have much editing at all , it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that does n't tell much of a story at all . the woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious . in my opinion , i 'd rather read it myself than have it read to me . i do n't like that voice there . as some of the other reviewers have said , some of the effects and costuming worked very well . very impressive for the time . the direction , action , and pacing/storytelling just did n't seem to work well at all for me . very slow . i fell asleep several times and had to rewind . if you want a good silent film , check out steamboat bill , jr . excellent
i would n't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it <NUM> stars ... a real injustice . this is a piece of garbage , plain and simple . if you liked their first cd you 'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band , no joke . the guy has a horrible voice and it 's only good when he yells , which is maybe in <NUM> songs on this cd , both of which fall apart after the heavy point . pure garbage , if you do n't believe me buy it and see for yourself , there 's a reason this cd is n't as popular as through the eyes and its cause it sucks
i am so sorry that i bought this book . it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman 's library edition . first of all the book is too large to read in bed . secondly , whoever did the proofreading should be fired . there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading . if the postage were not so expensive from israel , i would return the book to amazon
ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie , lots of action good gangster s * * * but this ! ! ! i mean wheres the firme musica ? ? ? you would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all . i mean some of the songs are good like the one bye funkadoobiest and girls it aint easy bye the <NUM> corners and the one bye boss catch hit and run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence , the one so ruff so tuff by zapp and roger great song ! ! ! but not on there . well i have them already it 's just the point that they left some stuff out . well ... just understand me , in what i 'm saying and get somthing else like the bound by honor soundtrack . now thats a good one ! ! ! as for the <NUM> in rating well you figure it out
peter hartlaub of the san francisco chronicle sums up the film 's lesson like this : `` keep disobeying your parents and eventually you 'll get your way . '' and i agree with him . this film is touted as being christian , is marketed through christian distributors and even comes with a bible study guide . i , however , could not find anything `` chrisitian '' about it other than it was relatively clean .. but to me just being relatively clean does not make it christian . i am a christian and i consider a movie as such when it portrays values such as ; respect , honesty , and honoring your parents even when it does n't seem fair . this film does not portray those values . if you just like horses and are looking for a decent film then you may like this one .
there are <NUM> good songs on this disc , stinkfist and aenema . the rest are pure crap . half of the tracks are n't even songs , they 're just a bunch of noise . no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster . they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $ <NUM> for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap . if you gave this cd <NUM> stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely
as others have pointed out , the group was just getting it together when the concert was filmed and it shows . while the audio is good , the performances in no way match the classic album they produced . also , the `` extras '' added to fill out this fairly slight offering , particularly those for clapton and baker are taken from the almost equally slight farewell concert film made about cream . for die hard fans and completists only
youve all lost your minds.please take a break.2 years or so.in this time listen to your first cd.notice the awesome sound ? ? ? the bass , the drums.notice the singer friggin going crazy.now when you make the next cd make sure the tone is exactly the same as the first.exactly.nothing different.it was perfect.like kfc chicken ! ! ! also jon , start wearing the adidas suit again and maybe youll have a flashback and start singing with true emotion again.also get rid of the lame masters of the universe mic stand ! money has destroyed yet another great band ! ! ! !
well , i am not financed by any right wing think tank ( but if there 's a think tank out there that wants to finance me -- right or left -- , give me a call ! ) , but forty years ago ehrlich was predicting massive global starvation in the <NUM> 's . well , i went throught the <NUM> 's and i do n't really recall that . if you 're looking for a scary but fictional story , read steven king ... or paul ehrlich i guess . but let 's not pretend that this has anything to do with reality .
i 've probably listened to `` crane wife '' several dozen times ( one of the perks of working for a hipster clothing retailer ) and after rolling meloy 's lyrics around in my head for a month or so i can honestly say that he has created the pirate-prog rock song cycle of the year , which somehow is not as cool as you 'd think it might be . what i really do n't understand is the slavering fanboyism this band seems to inspire within some `` intellectual '' music fan circles . just because you need to use a dictionary to decpiher meloy 's overblown dickensian narratives does n't make them well-written or intelligent . instead `` the crane wife '' is the newest addition to the recycled 18th century story sketches meloy does n't seem to be able to depart from . maybe i 'm just too picky but lyrics such as `` produced my pistol , then my saber to make no whistle or thou will be murdered '' from `` the island '' come off as extremely silly , especially when filtered through meloy 's extremely nasal delivery . the `` crane wife '' titled-tracks produce some interesting images , but ultimately lose their effectiveness due to meloy 's weakness for 10-dollar-words . overall , the whole album sinks under the weight over over-writting , over-singing , and over-playing . meloy and co. should put down the dickens for a little while and read some william carlos williams .
ok , this was the last jacksons lp and i do n't understand why this was their best selling , compared to the gem destiny and super giant truimph . my father bought this in <NUM> and did not even get his moneys worth . this is n't a reunion album at all . more like a high tech compilation disaster and jermaine is only included in <NUM> track and michael , only in <NUM> . although no video availbale , i love the mick jagger colab `` state of shock '' ( # <NUM> on billboard and # <NUM> on hot r & b/hip hop singles ) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp . `` torture '' was torture and so was the video . although top <NUM> hit , it was so horrible that jermaine and michael did not join their brothers in the video ( although they provided lead vocals ) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy . `` body '' was good although marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to micahel 's `` wan na be startin ' somethin ' . later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is randy jackson 's falsetto disaster `` the hurt . '' this lp ( although i do not own the cd version of it ) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it .
the mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion . the black eyed peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like . these guys have zero talent and zero class
i will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers , this is not a developer book , by far . it also has a lot of repetition in it . you can explain the different security groups twice , but <NUM> times seems like a little too much ... the fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me , because that is what i am looking for in a book . how to use sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
i 'm a loyal orton fan ; trailer park is her best , and i 'm a fan the `` other side of daybreak '' . this cd is a complete disappointment . it is trite , boring , and political in a very dull and usual way ; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness , charm , and melancholy that so characterize most of orton 's work . i get the distinct feeling that she did n't have this cd in her , but just put it out there because there were so many ( ourselves ) who were waiting . orton 's merit is that her songs come from her heart ; these songs come from her head . these songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop , and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden . we wish beth the best ; but we also wish she would give us her best ; and if she ca n't do that , well , we 'll be content with her 'classics '
sadly ... when ann coulter ( a transvestite - or possibly even a transgender patient him/herself ? ) launched her patently absurd & lame attack on john edwards ' sexuality ( never in question before ann 's pitiful attack ) ... she lost all credibility ... even with her beloved far right . if she ca n't argue the politics then i suggest she simply shut up . for this reason ... and so many others ... i have absolutely no interest in anything further to do with ann coulter . she gives conservatism a bad name
i do n't have much to say that has n't already been said , but i felt it important enough to pipe in and agree with most of the negative comments . the book is unnecessarily complicated , skips non-obvious steps in the examples , provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed , and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts . contrasted to james stewart 's calculus book that i 've used for the past year , this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an english major . the key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book . i 'm a berkeley student , for whatever that 's worth
because she is a real-life `` wife of , '' gigi levangie grazer has been hailed as the `` on the inside '' hollywood chick-litter . inexplicably , it turns out , because `` the starter wife '' is full of the vapid , name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from nebraska could dream up . gracie is a `` wife of '' -- wealthy , toned , dyed and perfectly preserved , and married to a hollywood heavyweight with one kid . until kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly , gets an earring , and then tells gracie that he wants a divorce . in the dizzying whirlwind of divorce , gracie finds out that he 's having an affair with britney spears ( presumably in the months before she started slumming it with kevin whatsisface ) . a concerned pal lends gracie her malibu house , so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track . and as she wanders the california beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend , gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man , and kenny 's dissatisfied has-it-all boss . can she become more than kenny 's `` starter wife '' ? okay , it has a different plot -- one that shar jackson might find emotional satisfaction in , admittedly . but the core of `` the starter wife '' is yet another thin plot , with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping . it 's even worse that much of grazer 's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press , brad and jen have broken up . so no one 's worried about them procreating . grazer 's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself , which meanders aimlessly between hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches . the writing meanders as well , as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space . grazer even has the excruciating taste to name gracie 's gay pal `` will . '' it 's not witty or cute , just embarrassing . perhaps the biggest flaw is that gracie -- the wronged wife of-turned-starter wife -- is a pill . despite the men going gaga over her , the supposedly smart gracie comes across as a bitter airhead , obsessed with age even when she 's feeling good about herself . kenny is a cliche of the selfish ex , while will is a cliche of the lovable gay pal . only lou , a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him , comes across as a real person . with more hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches , gigi levangie grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort . sure it 's just a fluff book , but it 's really bad fluff
there 's a lot to like in this book , theoretically . the worlds themselves are well-drawn , the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty ( that sort of mimics but does n't really ever come close to the best that william gibson has given us ) . the science is seamlessly integrated into the story , and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure . the theory does n't hold , though . this just is n't a very good book . the action follows three different characters , along three different threads . at first , and for most of the book , they have no obvious connection with each other . their stories appear to unravel aimlessly , and although lots of stuff happens , none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story . it has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations , physical or moral . there is a payoff , but it takes a long time to get there , and by the time i did i was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it did n't really have much of an impact . there are three major problems with this book : information withholding : i like books with central mysteries , that make you wait ( and work ) to understand what 's going on . it 's a good propulsive technique , plot-wise . but the mysteries need to resolve . the author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through , dropping occasional hints that are n't so much tantalizing as frustrating . as i said : by the time i figured out what was going on , i 'd stopped caring . this might just be my limitations as a reader , but i gather , from other reviews , that a lot of people feel the same way . you work so hard to understand what 's going on that it 's difficult to enjoy any of it . dreams : harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot : to elucidate the characters ' psychology , and to give us a window into their past . this is unfortunate , because ( in my mind ) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition , instead of wending it into the story . generally speaking , as soon as i hit a dream sequence , i lose interest . i lost interest a lot in this book . which is a shame , because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful , strange and sometimes even touching . it just needs to be presented better . unremitting dourness : there is nothing pleasant about reading this book . the main characters are either savage and unlikeable , pitiable and unlikeable , or mystifying and unlikeable . often all three . and , with the exception of the wife ( who i liked almost as much as i pitied ) , none of the supporting characters are much use either . the worlds they inhabit are brutal , dire , unpleasant , and dour . there 's a lot of sex here , but as portrayed it 's mostly just another kind of violence . the whole thing 's kind of a downer , pretty much the whole way through , and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing , as if it 's been grafted on from another , happier book . the writing itself has some odd lapses too , given the care that went into the structure of the book , and the obvious attention to detail . lots of tortured , passive sentences . a few bits of dialogue that sound like campy chandler . harrison is obviously very talented . i wanted very much to like this book , and i suspect i 'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future . there 's a great deal of potential here . it 's just that most of it went unrealized
this is the type of cookie cutter crappy late eighties dreck that was played on a lot of radio stations at the time . although , cheesy as it is now , definitely takes you back to a time and place , abeit , a very cheesy time and place . anybody still growing their mullet ! ( sic !
as a nursing major the book was difficult to get through . possibily due to trouble outside of school . definitly not easy reading , but lots of good information . i recommend this for anyone who is thinking about nursing
my daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps . that 's just a fact because we in a house in the city . this is the weirdest cd i have ever heard . it does n't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze . it does not help her sleep , in fact , it keeps her from sleeping and after a while , she is agitated until i turn it off . i 'd say if you do n't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this . i 'd recommend just playing any cd that you currently own on repeat mode during naps . the point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase , normal sounds in the home do n't startle and awaken her . if you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear , i recommend woody guthrie `` nursery days '' for your baby . it has become the soundtrack of our lives .
<NUM> 1/2 competent though disappointing , this highly referenced trance album can not escape it 's plodding , dated backbone of a beat , no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be . of course , listening to the album <NUM> years later , one immediately feels the bland , aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality , which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in house-centric circles that is . the thudding , ever present , 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper , rendering most of the yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal . thankfully once in a while , particularly at the start and finish of the disc , a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions , allowing dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways
although the last couple of years i mainly listen to jazz from the phenomenal period of music between the early <NUM> 's and late <NUM> 's , i am continually amazed at the abundance of quality output . the blue note re-issues of works by horace silver , lee morgan , grant green , larry young , hank mobley , art blakey and blue mitchell to just name a few are true musical expressions of a fine art . but ascension by coltrane is noise and certainly does not fit in with the works of the above artists which represented great musical milestones . only his early stuff can really be classed as music .
he sould keep writing rymes for other people i love rbx and the work he does with others but on his own not so goo
here we go again .... another tortured collection of three chord , twelve barre delta blues . in truth , these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited robert johnson first recorded them ; now hearing clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying . how many times can we hear `` i woke up this morning , baby ; my cow just up and died ..... da dum , da dum , da dum ..... i woke up this morning , baby . my cow just up and died . da dum , da dum , da dum .... so i drank a bottle of hooch and i began to cry .... da dum , da dum , da dum .... '' come on , people ! if this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization . when eric clapton plays cole porter , duke ellington , and rogers and hart on his guitar -- -unaccompanied -- -- chords , melody and bass line -- -- like django reinhardt , wes montgomery , and joe pass -- -- then maybe i 'll consider him a great guitarist . today 's youth are clueless about almost everything , and guitar virtuosity is no exception . i do n't believe clapton has ever heard of key modulation , arpeggios , or chord substitutions . in truth , he is an average rock guitarist , and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing , that 's not saying much . for anyone to call him a great guitarist , let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived , is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity . it 's like saying madonna is the greatest singer of all time . odds are those who make such vacuous , ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie woodstock generation who would n't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him ( which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time ) . i know we 're living in the age of grand mediocrity , but enough is enough . go buy a wes montgomery , django reinhardt or barney kessel album and listen to sophisticated , nuanced , and soulful guitar viruosity . if you have half a brain , you 'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated , unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like clapton and hendrix were great guitarists . if after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that clapton is a great guitarist , here 's what you do : pick up your fender strat , turn the amp volume up to <NUM> , smoke a joint , and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist . eric clapton is a great guitarist ! what a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s .
after norah 's first two cds and the little willie 's cd i was greatly looking forward to this release . to say the least i am disappointed . i was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep . where is the range of work ? all of the songs on this cd sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me . i 'm giving it <NUM> stars just because of norah 's angelic voice , otherwise i 'd have to give this one a <NUM> star rating
i ordered this book twice , especially because the picture shows the book with a blue cover which is the cambridge press edition.the books i received were not from canbridge press and did not have the appendix iii which is the genealogy . these books came from paperbackshop in england . i feel that the genealogy is a very important part of this book and should always be included .
`` the hospital '' as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience . it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one . i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's `` network '' and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness . i 'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole . if george c.scott 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding , drinking , or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant ? diana rigg is completely wasted in this film . her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by scott 's character . the film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of arthur hiller . the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
there 's a myth going around that jarvis cocker is some amazing poet , immortalising the average and championing the silent kitchenette majority . there is an equally prevalent myth that he tapped into a musical vein that discovered something new in old synthesized sounds and cheesily orchestrated compositions . in actual fact he both is , and has done , neither . this record is consequently as bland as it deserves to be . it is truly a non-event and should be avoided without giving it a second thought . the observations cocker is lauded for could be written by any <NUM> yr old public school boy who has watched coronation street or the royle family on uk tv -- possibly more authentically and possibly better . musically it 's pretty much the same deal . you feel like asking him `` what do you listen to for pleasure , jarvis ? it certainly ca n't be hackneyed crap like this . '' the whole thing sounds like early scott walker trying to do a number on a modern northern city ... pretending , sub joyce , that he casting it into an immortal and tragic frame . the problem is that jarvis has no muse . there is certainly no bloom to lift the themes and you 're left with a sense of dull ideas penned on the back of write-up from q magazine . i 'm sure this cd will appeal to someone somewhere . good luck to them and bon voyage . perhaps i 'm just too bored with mediocre efforts to lift my attention and join the party . jo whiley can probably fill-in for me while i 'm away doing something more interesting .
i 'm a huge alton brown fan . this is one of the books i asked for when my birthday came around . i thought i wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good . i was very disappointed . while there is some good information in it , it 's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes . there are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets , but a simple file folder would solve that . sadly , i will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase
this is an extremely dry anime . the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor . not so for the anime . the character batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version . expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking . these really make the movie crawl . one minute there 's action , next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism . seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 of the movie . the visuals are awesome , no question about that . even so , they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story . altogether , not much actually , happens during the movie . if you must see it , rent it first to be sure you want it
i was terribly disappointed with this king release . could a creative writing student done better ? perhaps . it was by far the worst published work i 've ever read . it was unreadable . throughout the entire first chapter i waited for a plot to be formed . the characters were choppy and the story went nowhere . the book seemed to be published on his name alone . i have been disappointed in s. king for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch . i am a long time fan , i began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book i read , written by him , was hearts in atlantis .
i ca n't stand this movie , it 's one of the worset . the acting is horrible , it 's dark , gloomy , and so boring . it 's fun to watch and make fun of it , but thats about all . i do not recommend it , i would give it zero stars if it was possible . the child actress `` mary '' and then the older grown up `` mary '' actress is n't suitable , she does n't even look like she could have been the same person or type , how awful ! watch another version , this one is a waste of time and money !
even with the promise of chevy chase dying in the first reel , this film is so dumb and bad . it 's easy to think that benji typed this film all by himself . except he would have eliminated chevy 's voiceover . i was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic , but it was too painful to be fun . chevy chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets
i loved amanda 's first two albums . but this ? some of the dumbest lyrics i 've ever heard . this cd totally sucks . buy her first <NUM> cd 's , but do n't touch this one ! ! i love her , but this cd is rotten to the core
i asked a friend for recommendations for a mindless beach read , and she suggested this series . i 've suddenly lost a lot of respect for her . it goes beyond being a bad book , into downright offesive . what woman behaves this way ? it seems assembled from off the shelf parts , by men sitting around a conference table , asking each other what women want .
having been a glass fan since music in <NUM> parts and a r. shankar fan for even longer , i eagerly anticipated this collaboration . individually , both glass and shankar challenged my listening in many directions . when passages finally arrived , it was a real disappointment . this work challenged only my patience and ability to stay awake . every two years or so i give it another listen to see if a new perspective emerges . it does n't
if you like crummy productions with scarred and silicone filled breasts , buy it . if you want to see real yoga adepts doing real yoga - this aint it ! the women could n't do tai chi or yoga if their life depended on it . a real hilarious video , buy it if you feel depressed and want to laugh real hard ..
timeline is equivalent to a <NUM> cent taco . it 's an indulgent bit of junk food . timeline starts with a hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico - an intriguing idea , but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters . there are so many preposterous story elements that it 's just really difficult to take seriously . the story is ever-predictable and ludicrous . but , a <NUM> cent taco is worth the effort if you 're real hungry . go back and read andromeda strain .
i rented this movie because i love adrien paul in highlander and well the premise that he is a vampire makes it all the sweeter . unfortunatly he alone could not carry the film . the movie is set in an skewed alternate version of the reality we all know . the version we get is a neo nazi like world in a bleak black and blue hue . the funny thing right off is the human police station is littered with propaganda messages and posters . why the filmakers put that in this movie is beyond me . i guess their trying to convey the surrealism of this world . vampires in this `` reality '' exist and recently exposed themsleves to humans at a risk of being demonized . then when the process is at its critical stage , a serial killer emerges from the shadows and starts picking off young college girls . we find out that the killer is a vampire and has a political agenda . which is to stop the vampires assimilation into humanity . a great premise which is killed at the very begining.the acting at best was a classic b-film . the actors look as though they know that the script sucks but they try to make it seem as if it does n't . adrien paul is very convincing in his role as vampire cop aaron . he is the only bright spot in the film . bai ling is a eccentric female vampire who falls for bookem woodbine 's character . i forget his characters name because he was as wooden as you can be . he does n't fit the whole `` tough cop in a bad situation trying to make the most of it '' kinda guy . the scenes in themselves seem ridiculous . at one point in the film adrien paul 's character is shooting at human cops because they attacked first i guess . he does this spinning in the air thing and you can obviously tell that he 's spinning on wires . the sex scene reminded me of well a soft core porno because the music in that scene sounded just like the chessy music in such a film . minus the nudity . you see them bumping and grinding but it never really goes anywhere . and they like showing a pillar apparently in the `` bedroom '' with ivy and water pouring down it . maybe that is an innuendo . the nudity that is in the film is downright ridiculous and makes the audience feel embarrased to watch it . over all i think it could have been done better and i only watch it to see adrien paul in all his sexy vampire glory . i 'd let him bite me anytime
i was extremely disappointed with this dvd , in both content and quality . i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances . fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences , be it for a television broadcast or live concert . the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired . but ... the `` bonus '' documentary was redeeming . `` half mile a day '' is definitely the stronger half of this dvd ; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the `` bonus '' selection . i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary
this music is pretty intelligent , but not very interesting . the forgettable melodies hardly connect with the complex rhythm lines ; on only one or two occasions on the cd satisfying harmonies come across . i bought this together with nitin sawhney 's `` beyond skin '' , which is an incomparably better cd - sawhney plugs in nicely with earlier work from portishead , hooverphonic , and even the roots . karsh kale however , seems to pay tribute to jean michel jarre 's `` waiting for cousteau '' . during yoga , my teacher wallpapers her lesson with a whale sounds-cd . when i do yoga at home , karsh kale is a neat substitute for that
the movies and stories are classic westerns , the quality is horrible , these are not remastered . it looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to dvd . if i did n't like the actual movies , i would not buy knowing the quality
i 'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing the horse whisperer a couple of hours ago . i 'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else . not only are marriages broken , but trust between parent and child . i 'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character `` can not control , '' `` just feels right , '' etc . and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best . i am saddened that these people do not understand what love is , or for that matter what marriage and a family are . the pain and heartache , the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing . i 'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book . i think that all i need now is to hug my sweet , honest husband and dear children , who know that the greatest gift i can give them is to love their father . that is all . my vent is over . thank you .
not what i was expecting from him . everyone out there knows boney is a fantastic saxophonist . however , this album left much to be desired . i wonder why he left paul brown , his former producer . he released some excellent albums with paul brown . i do n't think he 's doing well enough on his own . i did not find any track particularly mind-blowing . if anyone that really knows boney doubts this , perhaps you ought to listen to `` seduction '' and `` sweet thing '' before making any comments . this latest album is nothing compared to those two . woork harder boney . i would not advise anyone new to jazz to buy this album .
i absolutely loved that song `` carry on wayward son '' which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history . rest of the other songs on this album are not that good . 2-stars
i was very excited when i finally received this cd because of all of the great reviews . i listened to the first song- it was good . i listen to the third- it was okay . by the time i reached the very end , i realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one . the music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds . the melodies have been slightly changed , and some have a slower tempo than the originals . i do n't mind any of these things . the problem i had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles . all of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late <NUM> 's music ( i ca n't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds ) . i wish they added a few vocalists to the music , used a combination of styles , and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds . i suggest you buy a couple songs , but not waste your money on buying the whole cd
i am only in my <NUM> 's but i did grow up listening to the original album of a chorus line ( my mom used to play it while we were cleaning ) and i got ta say that this remake is awful . the original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah . i do n't recomend this at all . if you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and i know that you will enjoy it much better
i gave this movie every chance , but the story is slow , the acting is liveless ( ameche is the only one half-way decent ) , and the story turns out pointless . the ending doesn't really make any sense or have any impact , and the vagueness and indirection that is usually explained at some later point in mamet 's films is never clarified here . only watch if you 're a die-hard mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party , `` yes , i saw that one , and i agree it was bad ''
bought this cd quite a while ago . it is probably very good , but how can i tell when it wo n't play on my stereo ? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans . this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets . after buying the disc , i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says `` audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc . '' what a great idea : sell a disc to people that wo n't play for everybody . thanks a .. holes
if you want to read a classic of western mythology , look no further . this is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth ' about reality . the tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers ' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives . dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality , and when evolutionary 'science ' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy , ' this view will come out false . this could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight , so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong , let alone realize something is wrong with it . what almost everyone does n't seem to understand , even about valid arguments is this : all a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false . if the conclusion is outrageous , you do n't , `` bite the bullet , '' `` swallow the medicine , '' and accept the conclusion anyway . you say there must be something wrong with the premises , even if you ca n't point out where the mistake is . it took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why zeno 's argument that 'nothing moves ' is incorrect . but during that period of time , no one ( except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals ' like this dawkins character ) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves
sorry but i do n't like this , always the same distorded guitar , always the same riff , feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end , poorly done
well , the young gunz basically suck . their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame . they also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen . the production as a whole is decent at best . however , this album is <NUM> times better than the atrocity that is memphis bleek - <NUM> . but it 's still not good . jayz needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys ' that call themselves rappers . he should keep kayne , sigel , and freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting . young gunz & memphis weak just do n't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire roc for years to come . please jayz for the sake of the roc 's good name ... get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down . <NUM> star
englishman tony judt 's postwar is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking : to give a coherent account of the history of europe from <NUM> . the outline of events is well known : a continent in ruins at the end of the second world war , the miraculous rise of western europe from the wreckage , the concurrent enslavement of the east , and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems , culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control . it is a great story , surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization . judt seems to take the view ( with which most people would likely agree ) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics . in the big picture , communism failed because it was unproductive , capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite . the question he asks is a good one : why did it happen when it did ? why , after having survived so long ( since <NUM> , in the case of the soviets ) did the eastern block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties , and so rapidly ? his answer is , astonishingly , the helsinki accords . `` against all expectation , '' he claims , `` it [ brezhnev 's signing of the helsinki accords ] was to prove mortal . '' ( p. <NUM> ) . the argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the helsinki accords ( which included some boilerplate language on human rights ) , the communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the party . he thus attributes the collapse of communism to the role of dissenters within the non-soviet eastern block countries . judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field , not the actual players . he refers to himself as having been in czechoslovakia at this time ; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the soviet satellites were something other than marginal -- as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces . in this book , vaclav havel plays a far greater role than ronald reagan in the collapse of communism . in fact the name `` reagan '' itself only appears a dozen or so times -- in other words , it is rarely cited , and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do . ( reagan 's speech at the berlin wall is not even mentioned , something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar europe . ) eventually , the anti-american streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight : `` but it should not be concluded ... that it was american encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [ eastern europe 's ] liberation . '' ( p. <NUM> ) and then later , equally bluntly , `` ... [ despite ] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the american public record , washington did not ` bring down ' communism , communism imploded of its own accord . '' ( p . <NUM> . ) really ? who would have thought that forty years of american effort in the cold war was just a waste of time ? this proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against , but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of america , and specifically of the american taxpayer , in postwar europe . america paid for europe 's reconstruction ( marshall plan ) . america paid for europe 's welfare states ( by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense , and also in the form of endless credits and loans ) . america paid for europe 's economic prosperity ( by bankrolling the agencies which funded it -- such as the imf & world bank -- and by opening american markets to european goods while allowing european markets to remain subsidized and protected ; something that is still the case today , from agriculture to airbus ) . and finally , it was america who paid for the soviet 's defeat . without america , modern europe would not exist . yes , it is undeniable that communism rotted from the inside . but rot by itself does not cause collapse ( otherwise how to explain north korea , a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief ? ) such states continue to exist indefinitely , until given a push . and so to answer judt 's own question : the reason communism collapsed when it did was because america pushed . ronald reagan reversed american policy and stood up to the soviets , and did so at a time when the major western european states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement ( thatcher 's uk excepted ) . it had nothing to do with the helsinki accords . judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial , but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy . they are simply wrong . it is a pity judt fails here . the fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully -- or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up ( the european response ) . the lesson is that you must stand up to bullies . appeasement in all its guises -- rapprochement , ostpolitik , engagement , detente , nixon/kissinger-style scheming , or carter 's endless vacillation -- inevitably leads to failure . and when the bill finally comes due , as it always does , then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life . this was true in munich in <NUM> , and it remains true today . given the current state of the world , we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now . there are numerous errors and omissions , mostly minor ( iceland is missing from the cover maps ) , occasionally more significant ( for example , there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by american hedge funds against the weak european currencies did much more than just blow england and italy out of the erm in <NUM> . they also forced a hugely embarrassing french devaluation in <NUM> -- in the form of widened intervention bands -- and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments , basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy -- major changes in how these governments governed . the attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the euro , as a collective defense against george soros . ) but any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions ; in fact the strength of postwar is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics ( although weakened by the lack of source citations . ) it is in the small-scale work of collecting data that judt succeeds . it is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails . for example , toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the balkans following the break up of yugoslavia . judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar europe : the slaughter at srebrenica , in which <NUM> muslims were murdered under the noses of dutch soldiers serving under un command . he then goes on to contrast the situation when nato took over , at which point the slaughters promptly stopped , and ten years of peace ensued ( enduring to this day ) . surely this is something to which you would ask : why ? the answer is simple : the un force , as is usual with un forces , was too small , had a weak and compromised mandate , was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded , and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement . but the nato force tolerated no nonsense , they came in with the intention of standing up to the serbs , and had the roe to do it . the serb ` army ' ( if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term ) promptly collapsed . same lesson : bullies must be stood up to . perhaps it is the fact that the force was american-led which prevented judt from seeing this . ( at the time of writing , the un is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue -- this time in lebanon and darfur -- a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it , as seems all but inevitable right now . what a sorry institution the un has become ! ) judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent -- something usually missing from english-language accounts , other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly marxist . sartre and camus were predictable , foucault less so ( a substantial presence in france , but more or less unknown in america ) . judt appears to come from the political left himself , but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of foucault ( which can be summed up , deep throat-like , as `` follow the power . '' ) in foucaultian terms , the discourse of dissent ( which judt claims collapsed communism ) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time . he would have said look not at the surface , look at the constellations ( a favorite foucaultian term ) of power . any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in europe in <NUM> would center on the united states ( and might still do so today , despite a united germany , an expanded eu , and the absence of the soviet threat . ) in explaining the collapse of communism , historical roads as diverse as euro-marxism , macro√Ø¬ø¬Ω-economics , empirical rationalism or even great man theory all lead to the same place : america . but according to judt , washington had nothing to do with it . by the final chapters , any pretense of objectivity has been lost . 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world , but a passing american event that by implication the us deserved for its middle eastern policy . ( of all european leaders since <NUM> , judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for stalin or tito or ceausescu , but for tony blair . why ? blair supports american policy -- '' blindly , '' of course . ) in summing up what ( judt thinks ) binds europeans together , it is `` ... contrast with ` the american ' way of life . ' ( p. <NUM> ) lastly , not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to american readers . there is an overabundance of smug english circumlocutions and double-negatives : `` it was not for nothing , '' `` not perhaps terribly , '' and the like . meaningless modifiers , such as `` more than a little '' and `` decidedly , '' are used ad nauseum , so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words . judt could learn from the great english historians of the past , of whom there are plenty , from gibbon to churchill . there is in postwar none of their directness of language , that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose , noble in conception and majestic in scope . it is what makes reading them such a pleasure , whatever they have to say . reading judt is just a chore . in the end this book , for all its size , is just a sour little pamphlet -- an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain . it is the written equivalent of those old photographs of soviet leaders gathered atop lenin 's tomb on may day , in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out -- except that in postwar , it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing . postwar is not even bad history , it is non-history , just anti-american propaganda dressed up as scholarship . it should sell well in france .
as previous reviewers have commented , this is a very good overview of the cmmi . the authors work in the industry , and have done an admirable job presenting the nuts-and-bolts of this enormous topic in a straightforward fashion . but if you intend to use it as a tool , like you would paulk 's book on the sw-cmm ( sm ) , do n't buy it yet . the editing in appendix b renders this book useless to me ( i need it as a tool ) . when i compare the constituents of the process areas in appendix b to the cmmi ( cmu/sei-2000-tr-018 ) , there is erroneous duplication . e.g. , & quot ; commitment & quot ; in pmc reads exactly like & quot ; commitment & quot ; in requirements management pa ( it should n't ! ) . ditto for co in sam , co in ma , and the subsequent maturity level <NUM> process area commitments . the same erroneous cut-and-paste was made for the abilities , di , etc . the level <NUM> pas have the similar problem , erroneous cut-and-pastes from the rd template . i can not use this book as i 'd intended because of these errors , so i have to lug around the large heavy sei tech reports instead
layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time . cream is one of the most boring bands in history . why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like dire straits , and metallica who rock . ps.this clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all

after completing my first year of law school , i really wonder why so many professors use this textbook . more than half the people i spoke with in my class thought the casebook 's usability was poor or worse . property is not a difficult class , aside from future estates and related issues ( rule against perpetuities ) . the hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law , and this casebook does only an ok job highlighting that . it is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently . additionally , many of its cases are not sufficiently edited , thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue . my other case books are much more balanced on this issue . as a last note , the production quality is lower than what i would expect for its price . the paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price . i suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints , but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks , simply stated
shhh , do n't tell anyone but miles and his `` in your face '' trumpet give me a headache . i like funk and groove so i should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene . for me this cd is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums . i was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when i came upon panthalassa . track <NUM> of that cd ( in a silent way/shhh/peaceful ) is nice ; smoothing out and grooving out miles while staying true : say the purists . if you love it remixed and electrofied ( yes sir ! ) check out dj cam 's tribute to `` in a silent way '' .
the only thing milton friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper . ayn rand would have loved friedman 's disdain for the poor -- for anyone , in fact , lacking the `` initiative '' famously shown in a <NUM> cartoon in which barry goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a southwest ghetto and says , `` why do n't you show some initiative ? why do n't you go out and inherit a department store like i did . '' if you think the status quo was ordained by god , or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with , this book is for you . if not , start reading trotsky , lenin , and all the people with vision , compassion , and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet .
and folk revivalism is what it is , folks ; i 'll label it even if the populists fume at me because i know of more than <NUM> genres . meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the fairport convention , pentangle , and above all shirely collins . he even did an album of `` covers '' of shirley collins ' arrangements of british traditionals , a ridiculous concept if i ever heard of one . why cover another singer 's versions of traditional songs ? this idiocy should evince meloy 's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of british folk music , and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition . with no prosodic skill , he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as shirley collins ' repertoire . evidently meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a walter scott , s.t.c . or john keats , but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an american desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie . the wistfulness and romantic nostalgia of meloy 's work come off as trite and calculated for npr yuppies . moreover , his vocal range consists entirely of yelp , melancholy warble and nasal whine -- this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold . i 'll admit the band is at least competent , but do yourself a favor : buy comus ' `` first utterance , '' the incredible string band 's `` the hangman 's beautiful daughter '' or shirley collins ' `` no roses '' instead

eugene o'neill may have been the father of american theatre , but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in long day 's journey into night . o'neill 's characters were shallow , pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.the father-son relationship between james tyrone and his son , jamie , is meanspirited , and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems . tyrone regularly refers to jamie as a useless failure , and a drunk , not only to his face but to other family members , and in turn jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son , edmund . tyrone says such things as `` you 'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life ! `` ( p.32 ) and comments to edmund that , `` if he 's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey , he 's never shown it. '' ( p.131 ) . the characters of the parents are pathetic , the mother all fluttery and drugged , and the father as the stereotypical old , cheap , and mean failed celebrity . the only seemingly normal relationship is between edmund and jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love . the relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural , they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds . it is as if they entire family is bipolar . long day 's journey into night was based on the life of o'neill himself , with the character of edmund as o'neill . the mother of o'neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between o'neill and his older brother , and his father never accepted o'neill for who he was . these sad beginnings continued throughout the life of o'neill and was evident in the writing of this piece . if the characters in long day 's journey into night are closely based on his family members then o'neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine
i bought this book so i 'd have something interesting to read during my son 's tonsillectomy last fall . i was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it ! i got half-way through the book , and it bothered me so much ( my own issues getting in the way ? ) , i put the book away . i felt anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter , molly , while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with leo . i did n't like any of the main characters , including molly -- -all too unrealistic . but i picked up the book yesterday and finished it . the book was too flat ! though i do n't think she was a bad mom , she certainly exercised poor judgment ( and for what ? like leo was a good catch ? ) ! i wasted my time ( i do n't read books very often ) on this story . yet i did read the whole book , hoping it would get better , so i 'm giving it <NUM> stars . i did n't think i 'd get any more of sue miller 's books , but other reviewers said she has better novels
wu-tang clan has seen better times . i remember a day when you could n't help but love everything wu put out either as a group or individually . remember the good ole days of enter the wu-tang , liquid swords , tical , only built for cuban linx , and ironman ? now years later , the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim . do n't get me wrong , ghostface killah laid it down with his latest album fishscale . but clifford smith a.k.a . method man is a totally different story . 4:21 ... the day after continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling . there are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic `` is it me '' or the posthumous verse of odb on `` dirty mef . '' you can even accept songs such as the lauryn hill assisted `` say , '' the erick sermon produced `` got ta have it , '' or even `` let 's ride '' featuring ginuwine as being decent . one thing that 's become obvious is the fact that he ca n't hold it down alone like he did with tical . but a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we 've become accustom with from method man . i mean , `` somebody done f * cked up '' has some energy , but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once . the majority of 4:21 ... the day after is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both method and his guest artists . streetlife brings his wackness to songs like `` 4:20 '' and `` everything '' ( the latter also features an uninspiring verse from inspectah deck . ) and you would think putting method , rza , and raekwon on a track would be a banger , but `` presidential m.c . '' comes and goes without much fanfare . other weak selections include `` konichiwa b * tches , '' `` 4ever '' featuring megan rochell , and `` fall out . '' i honestly ca n't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21 .... the day after except to complete their method man collection . this album wo n't get much pub from def jam and it seems method man is going through the motions at this day in his career . everyone had high hopes for method man 's career ... but it seems like the only high he 'll be getting is with a blunt .
as a beginning blogger , i was disappointed with this book . i generally like the dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining . this one is not . the author is sarcastic -p. <NUM> `` what you 're not to read - i forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket . '' really ! the information on blogger does n't add anything that ca n't be found on blogger help screens . several blogging services , for example edublog , are not mentioned at all . last , the part of tens was not as neat as in most of the dummies books . i want my money back
for months , disney advertised this as a 2-disc special edition dvd . but at the last minute , that second disc mysteriously disappeared . why ? this is false advertising , and if i had my way , disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands . it 's unfair to force people who really want a 2-disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a region-free player . they did this same crap to alice in wonderland , but the other way around . uk lost a disc that we have , and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the us , but not in the uk , and giving fans in the us a 3-disc edition . i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world . unfortunately , i have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a `` special edition '' dvd . i do not appreciate being lied to . i still love disney movies as well as the excellent dvd editions , when disney actually releases the product they 've advertised for months , and i will continue to buy the quality dvd releases , but i do not enjoy false advertisement
the point has come that nearly all great recordings have been remastered in some way , shape or form and subsequently re-released . because of that i decided to get an ipod strictly for the purpose of `` collecting '' as many of my favorites as possible . my plan has been to buy most of them from amazon or an amazon seller & then put them on the pod . so much of my favorite music has been re-mastered ( makes me feel old .. maybe cuz i am ! ) that this has become quite a project ! anyway , almost every re-mastered cd i 've picked up has sounded better than the original . some are improved so much that it 's as if the album seems like a brand new release ( psbwb is a phenomenal example ) . anyhow , i did n't realize that cte was remastered and remixed when i bought it . i expected it to be like all the other remasters i 've listened to - a favorite album with much better clarity and a lot more boom . countdown to extinction is a masterpiece as far as i 'm concerned , even though my favorite megadeath album is probably peace sells . countdown was ( when first released ) absolutely perfect - something no other megadeath album had been . dave had recently gotten sober if i recall corectly , and that along with the new guys made this a new sound with much more maturity than before . it was landmark to be sure . did i mention it was perect ? the remix was a horrible mistake in my book . if dave wanted a remix for himself & burned it during the remaster work that would have been fine - but to release the so-called `` remastered '' cte in a completely different form sucks - i feel ripped off . i want the opportunity to own cte in remastered form without anything other than the quality of sound being tweaked . maybe if enough people complain and continue to do so the nagging will eventually lead to such a release . dave should be aware that potential new megadeath fans were won over by the thousands with this album , and it probably continues to do so - but if the average cd of cte floating around on the net or on store shelves <NUM> years from now is the remaster ( and thus also remixed ) , it will likely not win the new listener over . that 's sad , because cte is megadeath 's `` black '' album - and the remix is a completely different album with completely different songs . it is not a remix or a remaster , it 's a new release . had this remixed version been what was released when cte originally came out , it would n't be worth issuing as a remaster in the first place . i want my cte remaster ! ! ! !
terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with . although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue , it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid . it was a total watse of good celluloid
i picked this book up because i was running out of decent mystery novels , and figured i was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries . it only gets two stars because i actually made it through . and i only got through it because i had nothing else to read . i know nevada barr is a `` name , '' and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore , a popular one . but i could list the things that are wrong with her writing for ... well , let 's just say more space than amazon is going to give me for this review . her prose is bad . her imagery is unlively ( and if you 're going to write about a landscape like anna pigeon 's , you sure as hell ought to be able to write it ) . her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous ( anna 's romantic progression through this book : `` oh , i am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband '' to `` oh , it might be fun to be a lesbian '' [ an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve ] to `` let me have a fling with this random man , who , by the way , has as much character as a cardboard cut-out '' ) . worst of all , she cheats . i guess mystery writers do n't have an official code , but according to the dorothy l sayers model , thou shalt not give the detective clues not given to the reader . a mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle is n't there for you too . of course , if nevada barr had given us all the evidence she gives anna pigeon , there would n't be a mystery to have a novel about . her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot . this was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received . if you 're looking for an amazing female detective , check out laurie r king 's two series , one about sherlock holmes ' feminist partner mary russell ( as unlikely as it sounds , and more than good enough to make up for it ) , and the other about san francisco cop kate martinelli . if you want a book about living in the desert , i 'd suggest edward abbey 's _desert solitaire_ ( it even has a brief appearance by a dead body ) , or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _the monkey wrench gang_ . anything but this
i had the unfortunate experience of spending money at blockbuster and renting this dud . with such big name stars , i expected at least a mildly entertaining movie . what i got was one hour of lifeless , drab , big-budget flick . i could n't bear to watch another minute , thus `` tequila sunrise '' became the first rental i stopped watching since that fateful day i rented `` last action hero '' . the actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes , lending not one iota of believability to their characters . i 'm sure michelle pfeiffer , mel gibson , and kurt russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers . i hope the actors had fun making this production ; i sure as heck did n't have any fun watching it
had a huge crush on deven when i was little . silly little movie with very little plot . but brought back found memories .
i personally feel that the the book is small , being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards , but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book . a lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.the algorithms too are borrowed . information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking . unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and the osler medical handbook by cheng and zaas is far superior to this in all aspects . another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.the book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful . professor k.n.viswanathan , avmc , pondicherry , indi
i 'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because debbie harry is in it . it is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers ' discretion . is debbie harry real or is she just another `` videodrome '' hallucination ? i definately would n't say this is a `` fun '' movie either ... after watching it i felt dirty and sleazy , like i needed to take a long hot shower . anyway , since this is the big fancy `` criterion collection '' dvd , one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the tv version of videodrome shown on on sci-fi etc .. but no , instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of vhs ! they do n't even include the extra scenes as bonus material . what a waste ! unless you are really anxious to hear james woods commentary ( debbie 's on there too , but does n't talk too much ) then i would save myself the extra $ <NUM> and just buy the old dvd version
i was never much of a chili peppers fan over the years , but i thought i 'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.and just as i always thought , it 's crap . very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have . i feel like i need a bath after just looking at their picture . as far as the `` music '' is concerned , the singing is awful ( deadpan monotone voice ) , the instrumentation is very limited , and the overall production is 2nd rate . the only plus , if any , is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material , which is still not very good . the fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have really bad taste .
the best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and scorsese 's knowledge of new york personalities . but the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday , or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets . from the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality , scorsese tries to make an elia kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably . deniro 's performance as lamotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years -- monomaniacal mumbling , zero charisma ; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy . who was jake la motta ? why was he this way ? what was his background ? what did he hope to achieve ? on the criterion laserdisc of this film , la motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than scorsese and schrader 's drama does in over two hours . to me , that 's bad filmaking . i have heard from film snobs that much of raging bull 's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of scorsese . he had just failed miserably with new york , new york and this was almost a religious purging of his soul . i suppose if you want to read into it , be my guest . i consider that self-absorption . i have also heard the patronizing `` it 's funny '' angle regarding lamotta . i do not think this was scorsese 's intention and i do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny
there is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary : it is well presented with great cgis , narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars ( whatever this stars rating business means ) . the problem is the substance : it is simply not there . menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists ( as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents ) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it . i think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence . menzies , starts off with his conclusion ( rather than ending with it ) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it . when all alleged evidence is demolished , he arrogantly states that he will not budge , `` one millimetre '' as he puts it , from his theory and that , in time , everyone will accept it as a fact that the chinese were the first to discover america . a true scientist , even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint , always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future . menzies does exactly the opposite : with no evidence on his side , he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong . it saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea , menzies - not a scientist but , at best , a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that pbs , helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him . the feeling one gets at the end , is that pbs ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap 's air-ology . whilst visually pleasing , this pbs production is in substance a waste of time to watch , as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer

title begins : `` the party of death : the democrats ... '' just tonight - august <NUM> , <NUM> - while being interviewed about this book on the colbert report , ponnuru * clarified * that what he calls `` the party of death '' is really a collective of all who are pro abortion , regardless of political party ! ponnuru explained that he knows it 's not all democrats that are pro abortion , and he openly admitted there are republicans who are pro abortion ! so colbert asked ponnuru if he had also included the word `` republican '' on the book 's cover ( to be fair ) to show that some republicans are in ponnuru 's collective `` party of death '' , and ponnuru said no , he did not include the word `` republican '' on his book 's cover , and colbert then asked that maybe ponnuru did n't have enough ink to print the word `` republican '' on the cover , or maybe ponnuru did n't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word `` republicans '' along with `` democrats '' for the reader to understand his collective `` party of death , '' which again , according to ponnuru on national tv , is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion , not just democrats . yet the inside flap of this book asks , is the democratic party the `` party of death '' ? does ponnuru even know what he 's talking about when he 's this mixed up , completely contradicting his book 's cover and inside flap on national tv ?
i purchased this dvd , and could not get it to play in my dvd player . i sent it back for exchange , and received another identical disk that it too would not play . i sent it back for a refund , and was never able to view it . i never thought to try it in my computer , bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue . oddly , the dvd has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all dvd players in the us ..
... it gives one delusions of grandeur , a sense that any piece of garbage that comes out of one 's mouth is a work of genius . pure ego . pretention . stupidity . megalomania . do n't blame them so much -- blame us , we who actually bought anything lennon and the beatles put out . now , john came out with his best solo album plastic ono band soon after this so it 's not john 's lack of talent . this is what happens when cupid strikes you blind ... and deaf . do n't even think of buying this . i suppose the only good thing about is hearing the heartbeat of an unborn child and realizing that it is , after all , not a glob of tissues but a baby . so maybe there is some significant `` countercultural '' message in it , after all
author displays his ignorance of the holy scriptures through out his book . let me just highlight three areas . ( <NUM> ) he quotes <NUM> timothy 2:9-15 and then makes the following blasphemous statement , `` furthermore , they ( woman ) are held responsible for the origin of sin in the world : it was the woman who was deceived , not the man. `` how spiritually blind one can get ? let me elaborate . apostle paul in his letter to the church at rome writes : romans 5:12 `` just as sin entered into the world by one man , and death by means of sin , so death was imposed upon all men , in asmuch as they all have sinned . '' holy spirit is holding adam responsible for the entry of sin into the world . yes eve was deceived first by that serpent of old , called the devil . adam was not deceived , but disobeyed deliberately . adam was the door through whom sin entered the world . sin was the door through which death entered the world . i strongly feel that the words spoken by my savior , lord eshoo messiah ( aramaic for jesus christ ) to nichodemus in john 3:10 are applicable to marcus borg also . john 3:10 eshoo answered , you are a teacher of israel , and yet you do not undertsnad these things. ? ( <NUM> ) author writes : `` i see the bible as human response to god . rather than seeing god as scriptures 's ultimate author .... the bible thus tells us about how they saw things , not about how god sees things . '' this is blasphemy . holy scriptures consisting of ( law of moshey , prophets , psalms , four gospels , book of the acts of the apostles , <NUM> epistles of apostle paul , one epistle of james , two epistles of peters , three epistles of john , one epistle of jude , and the lord eshoo messiah 's revelation to john ) are living word of god spoken by his prophets and apostles through the holy spirit sent from heaven . if god had not revealed himself , we will still be speculating because we are fallen and fallible creatures . i thank the lord that he took initiative and revealed himself . apostle peter writes : `` we have also a true word of prophesy ; you do well when you look to it for guidance , as you look to the lamp that shines in a dark place until the dawn of day , when the sun will shine in your hearts . '' god with wisdom created the heaven and earth in the very beginning . book of proverbs was written so that we may know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ; to receive discipline , reverence , righteousness , and justice , and equity.it says the following about god 's word : proverbs 8:8-9 `` all the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing perverse or deceptive in them . they are all plain to him who understands them , and right to those who are willing to find knowledge . '' author ignored the words of the holy spirit spoken through king solomon , son of david , wherein he writes : `` if you will turn to my reproof , behold , i will pour out my spirit upon you ; i will make known my words to you ( proverbs 1:23 . ) '' in my view , author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise , he became fool ( romans 1:22. ) . ( <NUM> ) let me illustrate author 's foolishness with another blasphemy . he writes : `` but a moment 's reflection suggests that the ten commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view. '' . i wonder if he has ever studied the book of pslams . let me just quote psalm <NUM> where law is called law of the lord . psalm 19:7-11 `` the law of the lord is perfect , converting the soul ; the testimony of the lord is trustworthy , making wise the young men . the statues of the lord are right , rejoicing the heart ; the commandment of the lord is pure , enlightening the eyes . the reverence of the lord is clean , enduring forever ; the judgment of the lord are true and righteous altogether . they are more to be coveted than gold ; yea , than precious stones ; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb . moreover by them thy servant is warned ; and if he keep them he shall be greatly rewarded . '' book of revelation says that : `` this is the perseverence of saints that they keep the commandment of god and their testimony of eshoo messiah , who is king of kings , lord of lords . '' apostle peter <NUM> years ago had warned us of such self appointed professors when he writes : <NUM> peter 3:16 `` ..... in paul 's epistles there are certain things so hard to be understood that those who are ignorant and unstable pervert their meanings , as they do also the other scriptures , to their own destruction '' . holy spirit calls such authors as `` springs without water , cloud that are carried away with a tempest ; the mist of darkness is reserved for them forever ..... '' . `` verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them . '' author 's contempt for the holy scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the lutheran church . he says : `` i was nurtured in the the lutheran church and remained lutheran until about age <NUM> . '' luther is not much of a roll model for anything . it is luther who showed contempt for the holy scriptures when he called book of james , `` an epistle of straw '' . luther called book of revelation , `` worthless '' . talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude . lord eshoo messiah said `` unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of god '' . by that , my savior did not mean at all that we should be childish . what he talks about is having child like trust . book of psalms tells that `` he teaches humble his way '' . and `` fear of god is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction . '' to such self appointed reformers and professors , holy spirit had issued following warning in the epistle of james : james 3:1 `` let not many of you become teachers , my brethren , knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment . '' luther should have kept himself busy studying god 's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe , `` jews and their lies '' . this book came in very handy for hitler who sent <NUM> millions of the seed of abraham ( jews ) to their death in holocaust - pan european event . 6th commandment , which is law of god says : `` thou shall not kill or murder '' holy scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely . neither luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching . i am convinced that there was no reformation . things have not changed at all . in rome we have one pope on seven hills . protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill ( western and eastern churches ) . lord eshoo during his earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals , but instead said : `` because of the growh of iniquity ( lawlessness ) love of many will grow cold . will son of man find faith when he returns ? '' i want to cry out : help lord , godly men ceases to be , and faith has disappeared from the earth '' let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the holy spirit : proverbs <NUM> : 5-6 `` every word of god is pure ; he is a shiled to those who put their trust in him . do not add to his words ; lest he reprove you , and you be found a liar . '' he who has ears , let him hear what the spirit says to the churches . sincerely and cordially dr. ram munjal ph.d. ( physics ) ; s.s
although i do not agree with the message this cd is trying to get across , i will say the music is great . i think rock stars/celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded <NUM> year olds who think of rock stars as idols . it seems people in this world do n't make up their own mind anymore , instead they are manipulated by the `` loud-mouth minority .

this book would be more aptly titled , `` equiptment you could and should buy for photographing interiors '' . it 's designed for amateurs who do n't know anything about photography and want to be walked through the process of buying the right equiptment and then left in the dark as to how to properly use it . i know something about photography , and was looking for a book that would talk about photographing interiors and some exteriors . i was interested in uses of perspective , lighting to add drama , that sort of thing . the writer , once explaining the theory behind photographic principles , talks , not about how he was able to take successful pictures , but just that he did . he mentions the equipment he used and tells where he set it up , but for all his superflous text , leaves the reader with only the knowledge of how to re-create his shot in the same location under the same conditions . it began as an interesting read , as he explained about what the pros use . then he explained what the beginner could buy , but why it 's not really as good . he showed a few examples of how lighting effects a scene and alters color , but in general , his `` shooting by beginners on a tight budget '' should be `` shooting in these locations by beginners with several grand to spend on equiptment '' . i was hoping for a book that talked about the uses of lighting , the uses of color , actually shooting something besides huge , open , commercial structures . this is my first return to amazon
`` brutal planet '' review : in alice cooper 's long and successful career ( admittedly with ups and downs along the way ) , he has proved ( to me at least ) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history . albums like `` love it to death , '' `` killer , '' `` billion dollar babies , '' and `` welcome to my nightmare '' are just simply put - brilliant . alice was at the top of his game in the <NUM> 's . however , that is not to suggest that he 's never released worthy material since then . in fact the quite opposite . albums like his <NUM> hidden gem `` dada , '' <NUM> 's `` hey stoopid '' and the brilliant `` the last temptation '' ( <NUM> ) is amongst some of alice 's best work . however , in the summer of <NUM> , alice unleashed brutal planet , which was produced by bob marlette ( union - `` the blue room '' ) and executive produced by the great bob ezrin . while there are standout tracks like the title track , `` sanctuary , '' and `` take it like a woman '' -- - the album just falls flat . the new musical direction ( nu-metal ) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics alice has ever written . musicians : ryan roxie ... guitars phil x ... guitars china ... guitars bob marlette ... bass eric singer ... drums interesting facts : <NUM> . released by spitfire records , `` brutal '' planet '' peaked at # <NUM> on the billboard top <NUM> . <NUM> . there was a japanese/australian bonus track called `` ca n't sleep , clowns will eat me '' . that title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show `` the simpsons '' . <NUM> . the stage show - which can be seen on the `` brutally live '' dvd - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the frankenstein machine , a guillotine , two tv ` s - and in some cases - three tv 's showing weird video footage all through out the show . packaging : the album cover - which was created by kane roberts ' company planetfx - is a decent and once again , the booklet does feature the album 's lyrics . approx . running time : <NUM> min . and <NUM> sec . final analysis : musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy . despite being lyrically well-written , `` brutal planet '' is certainly the most disappointing release from alice since his <NUM> album , `` trash '' . * * 1/2 out of <NUM> .
of all the billboard cds , this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period . most of the songs are of the flip side vintage . the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on previous years . for myself , a disappointment
76:14 , remotion , pentamouous metamorphosis ... those are global communication albums . this is pure drivel comprised mostly of ( c ) rap and trendy house music that has been remixed . my biggest complaint is that i didnt buy this cd to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany ( c ) rap music ( and i use the term `` music '' here very generously ) and that appear here in a few of the `` songs '' . i bought this cd because the title of the group on this album is global communication , not gun master nig * er bit * h f * ! ker ! ! ! there is nothing here that resembles the music that global communication has released under the name global communication in the past ! knowing that mark pritchard and tom middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case ? i dont expect the same old stuff from them ( i was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to communicate ) but packaging this garbage into a cd released under the name global communication is like packaging porn into a movie entitled disney 's bambi returns .... it just isnt right and quite frankly , is super offensive . total waste of money for anyone expecting to hear global communication do something worthy of recording . through all their releases ( even the ones under other names ) this is the most shameful , vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention , thought or reflection
( <NUM> & 1/2 to be exact ) i have no ideal , why i 've choosen to write a review on this particular movie . i 'm not really a fan of comedies & after watching this i can see why . however , all in all , the film has been well made , and luckily does n't divulge into valugarity & offensiveness like a lot of recent comedies of this sort have -well maybe a little but not a lot . the actors are all likeable - unfortuntely i ca n't say that with some of the characters they portray . catherine keener is one of my favorite actresses but she does n't use her trademark sardonic wit and sarcastic humor like in a lot of her other movies ( i.e . being john malkovich , your friends and neighbors ) but she still manages to come away from this subversive comedy with a well likable character . ok , not to spend to much talking about this film : with all there is likable about this movie , for some reason , it just did n't gel with me . oh and by the way : i too know a few people like the character steve carell portrays in this film and you know what : they 're all highly intelligent individuals . sure they lack social skills and the right relationship , but why - in this country especially - is that so f & cking frown upon . if i had the choice of being a sexaholic hearthrob & a vastly intelligent person , i would choose the latter . seeya
this is n't a very good book . it might be good if you 're in love with history and you like reading 'harriet freed slaves . she took them to canada . ' over and over again . someone would read this and think harriet tubman was boring . if this is harriet tubman 's life , then my life is cool . in other words , beware . this book is only for school reports . i would n't say this is a good book by any means . it 's like being in slavery when you 're reading this . i 'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind
this is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting . and no , i 'm not even slightly exaggerating . it is also bizarre that i am the sole reviewer to point this out . janey is only a <NUM> year old teenager . she is indeed rather mature for her age . nonetheless , janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her . such an adult male ( or female ) is clearly breaking the law . janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined . the father is being played for a fool . this dysfunctional family seems doomed . janey 's younger brother needs her love and protection . is she capable of handling this responsibility ? will matters finally get out of control ? `` rain '' is morally bankrupt . the story line takes place in new zealand . perhaps the people associated with the american tv program `` to catch a predator '' and `` perverted justice '' should visit this country . david thomson flares into darknes
amazon 's review for this is ridiculous ; `` zeppelin 's one true disappointing album '' ( what about hourses of the holy , precense , in through the out door hmm ? ) `` there is some classic material here '' ? ! ? ! i have no idea what they 're talking about . this is the worst `` odds and sods '' album ever released . its truly insane to listen to this , and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults . it shows page 's poor mental state at the time ; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin . or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults ? that seems unlikely , but perhaps that 's the only way to explain this . did they really release everything they recorded ? the mind boggles ! nobody does that ; you do n't record <NUM> songs for a <NUM> song album , you record <NUM> , <NUM> and whittle it down to the best songs . if zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote , that would be amazing . it would be unlike any other band ever . sorry i dwell so long on that . it 's just i do not want to talk about `` the music '' on this album . its so incompatiable with zeppelin 's legacy , and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band , or it should be . this stuff does n't even qualify for the firm for gods sake ! as cynical as i am about led zeppelin , they could really get me rocking at their best ; they were majestic , mythical , and rocking , all at the same time ! they were a good band with good music , that always at least had interesting sounding material . this stuff would n't have made the grade on the sex pistols album ; its that bad . do n't buy this ; even if you 're vaguely interested , do n't buy this . if you like zeppelin , you wo n't after this ! or maybe you 'll just be a drone and use words like `` lost classic . '' if you do , you are a goofy sob
john le carre ' novels are all crawled forward like snail . reading his novels are just like reading those novels of those written in 19th century . his novels about cold war were like a guy walked in a dream , they have to be tolerated with extreme patience , because the blah , blah , blah sometimes would make you lose focus . this 3-dvd movie is just like his novels , so slow and so boring . i do n't believe any reader under <NUM> years could read along with great enthusiasm , his novels are written for the folks wearing bi-focals sitting on the recliners . i do think if all the spies who were caught and then put in jail during the cold war , there are <NUM> ways to make them confess and sing like canary : <NUM> ) force them to read john le carre 's cold war novels to bore themselves to death ; <NUM> ) force them to watch these 3-dvd movies , smiley 's people & tinker , tailor , soldier and spy ; <NUM> ) force them to listen to the sound track of 'sound of music ' 24/7 . they 'd be either gone crazy or hang themselves in their cells or , talk very soon : )
i just got this at a bargain price from amazon.co.uk . its great for completists and meek collectors , and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s . but it 's not very listenable . there are about four really good tracks on it , and no stars with the possible exception of glenda collins
the population of hong kong is approximately <NUM> million people . i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie . usually when a movie runs over <NUM> hours , it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in . in the case of hard boiled , the running time of <NUM> minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for `` most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture . '' chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay , and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff . he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging from a rope , while sliding down a banister ( ! ) , while being hurled through the air by explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . and he shoots , and shoots , and shoots . and the bad guys shoot , and shoot , and shoot . and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot , and shoot , and -- you get the idea . there are some fine action scenes in this film , but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended . there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next , and it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled . there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire
this band 's stated agenda was to create good old pop music , the kind you used to hear on the radio in the 1960s and 1970s . unfortunately , their execution was lacking . their singer and songwriter had next to no talent . his best work was singing with liz phair on a cover of `` turning japanese . '' and even that was hollow and soulless . then he killed himself and nobody cared except maybe close personal friends and relatives , but maybe not even them if they 'd heard this record . it 's that bad
this book says too little about so much . save your money and buy a real book not a promo type book for other books
i know that i will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes ... this is one of only <NUM> books that i have ever read that i truly regret devoting the time to , but once i start a book i always finish.i do n't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this . i just do n't get it . the main character was quite annoying to me and the story was so slow and predictable i really just wanted it to end . i would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you i am sorry .
there 's a reason why they talk about the `` voice of an angel '' -- it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one . her acting debut `` i 'll be there '' is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out of sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert . fast forward to the present : kerr discovers that unknown to him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth to a daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who is now a well-adjusted paper girl . the problem is , olivia has been kept a secret from her dad . rebecca is embittered , but kerr wants to get to know his daughter , and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father . music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together , but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps . `` i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler , who , despite being only in her twenties , has had an immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she will get a biopic , because `` i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way : it involves a rock star and his daughter . otherwise , it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting . with a forgettable script , not much humor and a goofy premise , the movie does n't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy , scripted for church to act out . and not a terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest ; it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills . the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet . as for acting talent , she is bland at best , but she does perform some good songs , and her voice is as pretty as ever . just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave does as good a job as she can , and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker . his is the only memorable role in the film , and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church . miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the britney spears approach . `` i 'll be there , '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can
the reason i purchased this particular cd was for the title song . however , i did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by john wayne that begins just before the song starts . what was the point of that ? who wants to hear john wayne speak every time one plays the song
it does n't worth more than any other book about fixed income and valuation . just four chapters about insurance . poor book
this book is a mediocre source for preparing for the pmp . it contains too many errors , inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test . if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book
probably the most ( although certainly not the only ) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on caroline higgins , a professor at earlham college . horowitz objects to higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the peace and global studies program , at a quaker college . it seems odd , to say the least , for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central quaker value . that horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection , and one involving such a tiny private college , shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to <NUM>
the debut blues traveler cd was truly fascinating . great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as gina , but anyway , warmer days , and sweet talkin ' hippie . this follow up travelers and thieves cd has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes . as talented as the instrumentalists might be , after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present . all in the groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody . mountain cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between john popper and guest , greg allman . in time i could appreciate it a bit more . onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic . however , the overall impression is that of boredom . the tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality . even popper 's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this cd . the discriminating fan will choose the first cd , four , and straight until morning and pass on this mess .
jesus , i 'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie . the only redeeming thing about it , was mia kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short . but besides her i the story was windy and contrived , too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to . mia kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me .
i watched troll <NUM> on showtime beyond ( showtime 's horror/sci-fi movie channel ) and like the movie itself is so bad it 's laughable ! i mean the part where joshua screams out `` your a genius big sister '' nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing the movie takes place in a small town where everyone is a vegan and like the religous people there have a phobia towards those who eat meat and they are `` unpure '' if they eat it which ironically saves johusa in the movie by eating a double decker sandwich with meat the goblins in this movie are creepy esspeically the one with the bolding eyes eek ! anyway thoughout the flim joshua is looking at pictures of creepy looking trolls which is ironic considering it 's golibins anyway in the movie the only way for the golibins to eat is for someone to eat something so they could eat them ! i 'm not a child but that still is a scary thought ! after watching this movie i did n't look at green and red the same way again nor could i eat much only watch this movie if you are looking for a laugh
for a <NUM> page book that focuses on only one subject , `` the homocysteine revolution '' should have included much more iformation on what a person should do in order to have favorable homocysteine levels -- especially when it comes to diet and other lifestyle habits . i bought this book for my father , and he and i were very dissapointed that the book for the most part negelcted this important matter , other than advising people to take b-12 , b-6 , and folic acid supplememnts .
this book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader . both my child and i felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects . trying to find information about da vinci 's life proved elusive . there was no infomation on his childhood , but most glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician or astromner . the focus was on his artistic ability , yet there were few pictures of his most famous works . the book did provide infomation , but in a rather boring and cluttered manner . this book is satisfactory as secondary reference . my child , an avid reader , did not enjoy this book . he said it was not for kids
this undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems . it is n't a bad little western , and the two lead roles are played competently by vera miles , whose most famous role was laurie jorgensen in `` the searchers , '' and sam elliott , who was born to make westerns . it had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations . unfortunately , the film was not well shot . none -- and i mean not one -- of the interior scenes is adequately lighted ; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background . the scenes in the cactus jail , which are key and set up the movie , might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light . then there 's the dvd which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film . the dvd is blurry and shows every scratch , spot , and speck of dirt that <NUM> years of obscurity could inflict on the print . too bad . miles and elliott deserved better . frankly , because of the technical issues , the film is probably not worth wasting <NUM> minutes on .
ho ho ho , what do you know ... the two `` it girls '' of vocal jazz both released holiday cds this year within days of each other ... first it was jane monheit with the ambiguously titled `` the season '' ... then came diana krall 's aptly named `` christmas songs . '' so who emerges victorious in this battle of the christmas jazz divas ? the first thing to consider , of course : who has the most gratuitous glamour shot on the album cover ? diana 's suggestive and/or very uncomfortable pose in some kind of lawn chair wearing a billowy shiny green dress ( strategically revealing as much leg as possible ) is a real contender ... but jane 's heavily airbrushed/photoshopped snow bunny/nymphette get-up ( complete with floating bubbles for no apparent reason ) is the clear winner in this category . on to the tunes ... i have to look closely at jane 's disc before putting it in the cd player ... it 's one of them newfangled `` dualdisc '' deals with a cd on one side and dvd on the other -- you can only tell the difference by looking closely at the tiny little print around the hole in the middle ... once you 've figured that out , you know you 're in for a rocky ride when the soft-rock contempo-easy backbeat of `` this christmas '' kicks in ... you got ta give ms. monheit credit for trying to come up with some fresh material here , but this is some really cringe-inducing stuff ... things do n't get much better with `` merry christmas darling , '' a comatose , melody-free bit of nothing featuring a tinkly electric piano solo and overdubbed backing vocals . things pick up on the more jazzy swingin ' tracks such as `` man with the bag '' and `` sleighride '' ... however on ballads like `` moonlight in vermont '' and `` have yourself a merry litte christmas , '' jane reveals a disturbing tendency toward mariah-esque melisma that will make your skin crawl . the guitar/vocal rendition of `` i heard the bells on christmas day '' is nice , but next thing you know you 're awash in the treacly jazz/pop crossover of `` my grown up christmas list '' and heading straight for the eggnog ... i do give jane a lot of credit , though , for including the somewhat neglected holiday classic `` the christmas waltz '' ( one that diana apparently overlooked or just does n't like ... ) what about the dvd side of this `` revolutionary dualdisc , '' ? wow , folks ... it 's amateur hour at epic records ... a faceless actor in the shadows pretending to be a radio host interviews jane ( looking refreshingly like a normal person ) about a few of the songs on the album , interspersed with badly lip-synched `` videos '' of those songs which consist entirely of soft-focus waist-to-head shots of ms. monheit uncomfortably hamming it up for the camera .. yikes ... oh , and you can also listen to the entire album in `` enhanced stereo '' ( whatever that is ) ... the best plan is to simply skip the flip side ... better yet , save yourself a few bucks and get the normal cd version if you intend to buy this album despite its weaknesses ( when it 's available again , that is : the original discs were recalled as part of the sony copy protection `` rootkit '' debacle ... ) decision : diana krall over jane monheit by a ( gentle ) knockout ... ( see my amazon review of `` christmas songs '' for details ...
while a good dvd by itself , its intentions are very bad . most of the footage was stolen from several people who were planning to release it on a different dvd
now that we have had the benefit of over two centuries of historical-critical biblical studies , we might now very well ask : where do we go from here ? i would offer that the fundamental working hypothesis of such studies is that `` they made it all up '' and so the scholarly task becomes one of reconstructing that process , but the unquestionable assumption behind it all is that anything , positively anything , is more credible than traditional christian faith ( this is amounts to , for the critical scholars , a doctrine of `` justification by doubt '' ) . and so the game proceeds . canonical scripture is called upon , and even appealed to , when it can be interpreted to support the working assumption that nothing at all is what it might seem when it comes to christian origins . but whenever scripture supports a traditional understanding , then it is systematically demolished , discredited , decoded , and rejected as the purely ideological product it most assuredly is . and all of the other texts , the schismatic , heterodox materials and the gnostic drivel -- which the church had its apostolic reasons to reject -- must simply be seen for what they are , and not evidence of christianity 's original `` denominational '' condition . bart ehrman is a most clever and educated man , but , contrary to what some might assume , he does approach the material at hand with a clear bias and set of preconceived understandings . so let 's forget all the by now stale appeals to scholarly objectivity ( not to mention , personal integrity ) and letting `` the sources speak for themselves '' , because that is just so much fantasizing as well . traditional christian faith is dismissed by ehrman and his ilk as being simply one more product of identifiable historical forces and thus it has no intrinsic claim to truth . but try reading the bible with the assumption that it is all true , that what it tells us about who jesus of nazareth is , and the beginnings of his church are a reliable enough account of what did happen . i realize that such an enterprise is inconceivable to the scholarly guild ( with the refreshing exception of people like luke timothy johnson and n.t . wright ) , but philology is not faith , and in the end , it should never even be considered as a basis for it . ehrman 's reconstructions are thus of interest only to a person who would treat any kind of 'faith ' resulting from it as a kind of personal plaything , and not as the daily challenge to his own being . remember , christian faith is ultimately about god and our relationship with him , and not about the way in which we might choose to arrange the intellectual games we play with faith and our musings upon it . if you are interested in keeping god at arm 's length and not dealing with real issues of personal growth and spiritual integrity ( the kind that comes not from footnotes but from abiding in the holy spirit ) , then buy this book , read it , and enjoy whatever feelings of superiority it might give you . but if not , if you are seeking the one , true living god who awaits those who would believe in him through his son jesus , who is the christ , then forget about it and all the other 'ragings of the pagans ' . you see , they are the ones you will be able to spot on the closeout shelf .
wow ! this is without a doubt , the worst original cast recording i have ever heard in my life ! ! ! every song is pathetic , thank god there are only <NUM> of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap ! not even `` chitty chitty bang bang '' was this bad ( and that was really bad ) . while i was listening i kept waiting for it to get better , to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing , anything , but nothing changed it just kept getting worse . this crap includes the songs : this side of the tracks -- 1/10 one step closer -- 4/10 the buck stops here -- 5/10 it does n't take a genius -- 5/10 owner of my heart -- 5/10 the great american tv show -- 2/10 flushed down the pipes -- 5/10 storm 's a-brewin ' -- 5/10 road kill -- 5/10 but he 's mine/it 's never easy -- 3/10 that 's why i love my man -- 4/10 panic -- 5/10 finale -- 1/10 this side of the tracks ( reprise ) -- 1/10 when i bought this album i thought it was going to be another bat boy , but boy was i wrong ! do n't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do ! p.s the little lines before the numbers are minuses
this is a terrible album . cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is . the cover artwork is pretty funny and cocorosie is a cool name , the only problem is that they make music that sounds like it does and they charge people money to listen to it .
wow ... i thought this album was going to be `` too damn hot '' ... it is `` so damn not '' that it 's frightening . the tunes are weak , the doctor 's playing is okay but not inspired and bernstein 's guitar playing is beyond lame . i 've seen bernstein at a club uptown and he was decent at best ( better comping , not a great soloist ) but this album does n't display the best of either of these wonderful musicians ' capabilities
this book has a lot of names . i 'll give it that . but , there are some relatively common names that are missing . and so many invented names . my favorite of the invented names are schmoopie and poogie . as if these names will show up on a birth certificate ! ! the definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing . for the name `` cowboy '' the book tells you it means `` country '' for the name `` country '' it tells you it means `` western '' . not that either of those is a standard name , but , for `` words as names '' are n't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you ? also , the lists are totally false , something the author ( if you can call her that ) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies . and some of the names on these lists are n't even found later in the book . ( ex . lynus on the `` party animals '' list ) i wish i had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book i saw at walmart . i figured with so many names i would find one i liked , but i am just so distracted by all the junk that i will never find a good name here .
i can not recommend this novel to any reader . it had too many aspects of the countless , over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome . it was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together . the history , the relationships and the settings were unbelievable .
this is what occured when i heard this album . i immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out . and guess what ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! there was blood in my stool . damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics , curse you for wasting beats , and shame on you for calling this album `` blood in my eye '' when you do n't even know the history behind the book called `` blood in my eye '' . listen to us ja quit rapping and go work at kfc
although an interesting read , it sure as hell was n't worth the price ! this little book should have donated as a side dish . i guess you could say we got screwed , jack ! i can hear hunter laughing in hell right now ...
i first saw this movie in high school-i believe i was a senior-and i remember thinking , `` high school is not like this at all ! '' throughout the whole movie . now , i do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world , where anything is possible ( except laney boggs becoming prom queen of course ) , but i felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it 's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie . first of all , why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a prom queen ? ? ? in my school , the homecoming court and prom court were chock full of nice , friendly kids , and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities , not because they were hot like taylor vaugh or whatever her name was . i hate that stereotype because it does n't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest ! also , what was so terribly heinous about rachel lee cook that they would pick her over any other girl in the school-so what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body ... her only flaw was her love for being a loner . freddy prinze jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone wayyyyyyy downhill since this movie was released . the best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when laney walks down the stairs to sixpence none the richer 's song kiss me . the biggest let down of this movie to me though was that taylor won prom queen over laney . seriously , that still pisses me off to this day . the ending was just a complete and utter bomb ... i wanted that skank taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had some minor bad thing happen to her . she was just a horrible , snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her . oh well , this movie is pretty lame ... i will always remember it though because i saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year . cheesy movie ... laney boggs was robbed ! !
first of all , i think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money . i would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators . the question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of islam ? why today middle east is the target by the oppressors of the new world order ? who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring democracy to a muslim world . what would happen if islamic constitution would establish in western world . it would be a scary scene for that part of the world . those who are muslims or studied islam knows that it is a religion of peace . the word jihad in islam corresponds to fighting against the devil who resides within all of us which is <NUM> % of jihad and the other <NUM> % of jihad is self defence . there is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators . comon people lets not have a religious war , we are all the children of adam and beleive in one god . let us all join together to fight the devil who is here to destroy each individual of us . we must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of devil are doing to bring one world order and to enslave us under the devil government . peace to you all
i have to admit , i have forced myself to listen to michael weiner 's abortion of a talkshow more than once.in a way it 's almost humorous , until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously , they view him as a deep political thinker . he is not.he is an ignorant , homophobic , sexist , racist little subhuman troll . an insult to true , honest-to-god old-fashioned american conservatism . william f. buckley jr he ai n't . what this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual . one would find more insightful comments at your state 's mental hospital , or by a survey of several of your town 's homeless population . i ca n't wait for the day when savage , limbaugh , hannity , o'reilly and their counterparts on the left moore , franken , janeane garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve . or even better , we could get nasa to get cracking on building the first solar lander , and have them put these windbags on it . the average iq of the nation would increase , and perhaps we would then be able to listen to real political discourse , instead of a bunch of ignorant , partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another .
hard to believe it has been ten years since load came out . like many metallica fans i recoiled against it , not because of the songs per say , but the whole image change , the shock of metallica being on lollapalloza , the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by hetfild and ulrich towrds metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.it was too much for many people to take , and they rejected load right then and there . that said , with <NUM> years passing by , one can listen to load is a clear eye ( or ear ) . the fact is that while load is not up to the previous standards of metallica , it isint all that bad of an album , and despite the dramatica image change , it isint `` alternative '' , either . what load is more or less is metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal . think black sabbath , ac/dc , sad wings of destiny era judas priest , deep purple , budgie , ufo and thin lizzy . it are these influences that are most heard in load . the mid temp , chunky riffs , the wah-wah pedal drenched solos , simple 4/4 based arrangements . certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous metallica albums ( even the black album still had agressive and progressive influences ) . the problem with why load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold . one , at <NUM> minuites , there is quite a bit of filler on it . the hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a <NUM> minuite frame work at the very most when it came to lps , load would have been a double lp , and the number of successful double lps in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand ( the only one i can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is led zepplins physical graffiti ) . the filler material really weights the album down . the other problem is the bland , mid range production that bob rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power . some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last <NUM> years . songs such as king nothing , 2x4 , bleeding me , aint my [ ... ] , torn within , the outlaw torn and wasting my hate are fiarly solid . the problem is the rest of the material is not solid , and still has the lifeless sound . had metallica only released one instead of two loads , had metallica had better , more lively production , and had metallica taken the better tracks off reload such as fuel , devils dance , unforgiven ii and where the wild things are , then it very well may have been a near great cd ( think <NUM> stars or a- grade ) , but alas , metallica went a different route , and the loads are still considered a failure overall . i do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire load cd , but the individual tracks i listed for ipod make for decent rotation material
cynthia bass had the elements and the right characters for what could have been a sweeping epic . at best it was a fast read . not much takes place aboard titanic , since sumner spends most of his time in his room , not interacting with the interesting characters . which makes a reader care very little about them . and the sinking may as well have been about another shipwreck . she certainly did not describe the sinking of the titanic
the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film
i bought this hoping it would be a thorough historical , architectural and artistic explanation of chartres , and it really provides very little of such information . it 's mostly an hour of repetitive visual shots accompanied by chants . really a waste of money
as with most greatest hits collections , the record company leaves off just enough hits to make you wonder & quot ; what they were thinking ? & quot ; they also put on a few tracks that make you wonder & quot ; what were they thinking ? & quot ; here , there are some obscure tracks that clearly are & quot ; filler & quot ; while omitting some of his best tracks from rock radio and even top <NUM> hits ? where is i found somebody ? ( oops , that was only his first top <NUM> & quot ; hit & quot ; ) where is & quot ; partytown & quot ; ? ( probably his best party song and a big hit on aor radio in the early <NUM> 's ) . & quot ; do n't give up & quot ; was also a rock radio track and a great song from his first album . i would title this album & quot ; some hits , some mediocre stuff , some stuff sorely missing , sorry. & quot ; now , where is that eagles box set we have been waiting <NUM> years for
however , with all the good material in the early <NUM> 's coming out i was suckered into listening to just about every little thing . this has some rather blah songs on it , and the thing is they try to sound like everyone , but themselves . on `` dead & bloated '' they try to sound like danzig , `` sex type thing '' which is the best song on the whole album they sound like alice in chains , `` wicked garden '' and `` plush '' they sound like pearl jam , and probably the only song that they do sound like themselves is `` creep '' , and with this one i have some rather bad memories of this as i remember this is one of the songs i heard all the time when i first moved down to florida . i moved down with no job , or no car , and i was bored out of my skull , and no social life either , as no one seemed to speak to one another . as the lyrics go `` feeling uninspired ... think i 'll start a fire '' . now that i was down in florida full time i was n't having a good time , and i know even now listening to this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here as if they were yesterday , and it 's because at times i feel it was . everything else on this album was too perverted , or just too long-winded .
this is an appaling book , spouting the kind of africophobism that genocidist writers like conrad and haggard did many years ago . this man is a stooge . avoid at all costs
i give this hack job the extra star for the fact that it had some very creepy visuals a handful of jumpy scares & a good idea for a story . how sad is it though when that kind of potential ca n't crutch the horrible outcome , wich resides in plot-hole central usa , home of the university of bad acting & laughable endings ( ubale ) . oh man ! horror fans ! `` boo '' could have been an excellent new low-budget horror flick if it had a tighter script with a much better ending & included some half decent actors who actually had a grip on there character 's . all & all what we are left with is an all over the place mess with some good visuals & scares . so many missed opportunities & so much potential lost . what a sad waste !
i am currently taking an undergraduate course on cather , and i hoped that this book would provide some insight into a side of her not covered in the course . however , i found the book full of jargon which rendered it incomprehensible to me . perhaps if you are already initiated into the world of & quot ; queer studies & quot ; you will find it interesting , but i do n't recommend it for a casual reader
this book was an incredible waste of time . i felt that the essays were a ) far too dated ( a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies ) or b ) too out of touch ( rape in cyberspace was not a real rape in cyberspace , folks ) the authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and i have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays . finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics . not even a single case study
i felt that the tamara hayle mysteries are all missing that at-the-edge-of-my-seat suspense that is required in mysteries . i could n't care less about the characters , and the outcome was predictable
living near mccarter theater in princeton my ap english class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for broadway . afterwards , my teacher asked what we all thought , of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the `` favorite '' students knew which opinion to take . they all raised their hands and said they loved it to , however , no one could say why . why not ? because everyone hated it . i was the first to open the flood gate . `` i thought it was ridiculous . it has no real substance to the plot . '' `` that 's because the language is the point '' `` well the language is the worst part . why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors ? especially ones that stupid ( 'does the bicicle miss the boy ? ' ) ? '' my teacher flipped out at this . `` you do n't understand ! that 's what literature is all about ! metaphors ! '' the woman , asides from being a gigantic b * * ch , was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on jimmy smitts . a month later , the new york times , reviewed the play after its broadway premiere . they said pretty much exactly what i thought . i was going to bring the review into class , but why bother ? the woman already hated me . ps . one earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped . during a q & a afterwards , emily mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this . i agree with the reviewer that they clearly did n't come to a good solution
along came polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely jennifer aniston makes this film almost worth while . i probably would have turned this movie off if it was n't for her . aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one , she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. ben stiller is another story , he always picks the same , stereotypical role . i guess stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part . oh well , along came polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon . i recommend the good girl or reality bites instead
frankly , sex magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe . masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a sigil . have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal . simple , no ? and , guess what ? that 's all this book says , as practical information goes . the rest is conjecture , faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed
a moose from california compared audra 's `` bill '' with one done by jane monheit . i took his advise and listened to both . audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz . the moose from california has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.this is a sad recording as far as jazz goes . it should be in the cabaret bin . absolutely ! !
while julia barrett touches on the language `` spoken '' in jane austen 's novels , it 's not expressed with any feeling or wit . the words seem to be a jumble of austenique words placed to look good , but not sound good . after chapter <NUM> the book goes into a million different directions , is narrated from several characters points of view , leaves almost no room for the main characters ( charlotte heywood ) views to be expressed , her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy . in most of austen 's novels , you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her `` intended '' . in charlotte , you wonder how they fell in love at all . they rarely see one another , they rarely speak and when they do , it 's mostly short and nonsensible . then there is the plot line , or rather shall i say lines for there are several ( thank you mr. collins ) . there is the plot to save sandition by gaining a physician , by adding a crescent , allowing racing gentleman and their horses ( and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out ) and then the smuggling and bootlegging . dear me ! how did anything get done ? i confess , i got bored and just scanned the rest of the book ! honestly , i was disgusted . if you love austen 's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it , let me recommend a book far superior to charlotte . instead try sandition . sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places . charlotte heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around sidney parker . however on the whole , it 's a much more convincing end to austen 's last attempt . the characters actually grow . they learn . here is an example . in charlotte : arthur parker is an `` invalid '' who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended , also thinking herself an invalid , about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments . to which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease . and then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them . ( sigh ) . in sandition : arthur parker is an `` invalid '' who realizes that perhaps , not only is he not an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain . he falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints , only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest . he learns from her what it is to be healthy . they both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes . he collects and she draws what he collects . he learns to protect her ( instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses ) and she learns to be stronger . sandition is also a book in which you can actually see charlotte and sidney fall in love . you can watch her struggle over `` does he or does he not '' . it 's a much more delightful alternative to all the `` our herione '' and `` our hero '' and `` my herione '' and `` my hero '' 's that go on in charlotte ( if i read one more of those i thought i would choke ) . so , to sum up ? do n't do n't do n't waste your time , money or energy on charlotte , but do get sandition . it 's a welcome addition to jane austen 's library
i have read all four of sarah vowell 's books . i believe that is all of them . i thoroughly enjoyed three of them and would strongly recommend them . with for radio on , her first book , she seems to be in a different place . radio on is a diary of sarah listening to the radio . although the concept is interesting , the result is a lot of very short entries in which there is little opportunity to develop anything . but the real reason i did n't like radio on is because of sarah 's perspective at that time . she is a very critical person in this book . nirvana is the greatest band ever , and the grateful dead is worthless . whether it is music , politics , or a variety of other topics , you get the clear impression that her opinion is right and any others are wrong . radio on is a very mean and negative view of life and our world . the worst case scenario , though , is someone reads radio on first and does n't read sarah vowell 's other books . that would be huge mistake
this is the film that could easily have tanked the career of lesser mortals , but the mighty jane fonda continued acting in six or seven subsequent films until <NUM> , when she married ted turner and her film career ended rather abruptly . kris kristofferson is simply awful/laugable in his role as a wall street troubleshooter . do n't look for this mess to be released on dvd anytime soon , unless it becomes a camp favorite . this film tries to be a potboiler , but it ends up being a soap opera with the world economy as a backdrop . it 's one establishing shot after another , and the actual consequences of any actual conflict are too abstract for anyone to care about . fonda and kristofferson must have been embarrassed at this thing . it 's just a sheer waste of two good actors . the plotline is so paper thin that even a kid in second grade would find it to be implausible . in fact , here 's a script for a story that i wrote in about three minutes , which would have made more sense : `` heroes of the stratosphere '' by thomas redmond after taxiing down an airport runway near san clemente , california , jane fonda and kris kristofferson take off in a badly-maintained twin engine biplane with jane fonda piloting . at 6,000 feet , jane decides to put the plane through its paces , and begins performing aerial stunts like barrel rolls and steep power dives . unfortunately , the airplane is not in very good shape and after about ten minutes , part of the left wing flies off . `` hey ! , '' yells kristofferson . `` hey , yourself ! , '' yells fonda , coyly . `` yow ! , '' replies kristofferson . at that point , fonda manuevers the biplane into a tailspin , and kristofferson flies out of his seat , into the air and begins to fall to earth without a parachute . then , in an attempt to save kristofferson by scooping him into the navigator 's seat , fonda puts the plane into a steep dive but is unable to rescue the hapless kris because of the damaged left wing . fonda ends up crashing the airplane into a lake near the dupont estate near wilmington , delaware about a half an hour after takeoff . somehow , both kris and jane emerge from the experience unscathed . later on the two are reunited and they get married and live happily ever after . the end
i can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke cd ! this is just a regular music cd with the lyrics inside the package . the lyrics do not show up on the tv screen when put into the karaoke machine . no fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another , under good light because the type is so small ! ! ! ! oh yeah , great fun for a <NUM> year old ..... not ! !
the two best essays in this book had been previously published ( perhaps in oprah 's magazine ? ) . most of the rest were shallow , not long-term friendships , and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month . do n't bother
i 'm a huge fan of the show and i 'll never buy this . the suits in hollywood have outdone themselves with their chintzy decision to release this best of - rather than season by season . pathetic
there was a flaw on the dvd . it would get to a point and stop . it was a gift and <NUM> days would have passed before it could be returned
this book reads like a graduate thesis . it manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments . each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length , but i recommend not finding out for yourself ; spend your money elsewhere
if you find another source for this movie , pursue it ! i liked the movie very much , and saw it first produced on showtime entertainment . this copy appears to be burn made from someone 's tv set . good movie for cheesy fun films , poor quality recording .
`` phoenix '' : this is the first record grand funk made after one their core members was ousted -- terry knight . it 's a good record , at best . however , compared to the albums released before `` phoenix , '' it 's a real yawner . the twinkie clavinet on some of the songs is hideously reminiscent of the partridge family 's sound ! it 's the anti-gfr , i tell ya ! another negative is that the `` phoenix '' era of gfr is sort of a precursor to `` christian rock '' -- lame ! it 's an all-too typical story in rock-n-roll land ; the rich rock musician does things on tour that 'd make the marquis de sade blush , feels guilty about it , and then hands out advice on how everybody else needs to find jesus . gag ! the liner notes of this record states , `` although not a million-seller , `` phoenix '' was nonetheless another top ten album for the band , and proved they could do it on their own . '' well , i 'm not sure just what they mean by that `` it , '' but for me `` it '' has to do with losing their great sound by kicking out one of grand funk railroad 's founding members , and replacing him with a large sack of sweet'n low . about the `` grand funk remasters '' : first of all , what took so freakin ' long to release these records in this format ? why do we have to listen to crappy sounding cds in this day and age ? as nathan ( william snape ) says in `` the full monty '' during one his dad 's ( robert carlyle ) clumsy dance rehearsals -- '' that were crap ! '' even the beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality cds ! ( `` the capital albums vol . <NUM> '' ) oh well , better late than never , i guess ! i just have one last thing to say to the record companies , et al involved concerning this faux pas ; guess which finger i 'm holding up ! there 's a world of difference between the sound of these cds and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material ; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters . however , the bonus music on these cds makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes grand funk .
i do n't understand all the raves for this cd , i was so disappointed when i listened to it . i 've always liked john barry 's film scores but in this re-recording all life has been drained out of the music . where 's all the emotion , the excitement and pathos ? instead , every track sounds the same -- they 're all filled with a melancholic boredom . give me any of the original soundtracks over this & quot ; easy-listening & quot ; interpretation
seasons one , two , three : `` go man , go ! '' season four : the one to forego . speaking as a fan who was first stupefied ( amazed ; astonished ) by bob and david back when they were the kings of megaphone crooning ( `` people did n't want to hear songs about things that had n't even been invented yet ! they wanted to hear songs about new things . `` ) , that is , speaking as the rare fanatic , the rare `` mister mr. show '' raising his voice on amazon who laughs just as hard at the good g rated sketches as he does at the good nc-17 rated sketches , i find `` season four '' the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless ms sketches available in one package . funnyguy bob odenkirk , reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life , says that four was the season when `` well-crafted '' sketches were `` in '' , `` absurdity for absurdity 's sake '' was `` out '' . no longer , he claims , was mr. show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers . translation : they dumbed it down for the audience ( and/or : horsing around in the writers ' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat , facing the corner ) . enticing as the term is , `` well-crafted '' here seems to mean `` warmed over snl type stuff '' , as in : spicing up the world 's 1000th jerry springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat ( momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is `` funny '' incongruity ) and ladling on the same gay panic , the same class anxiety that makes the real springer show such a howl . overall , ms4 's concepts become less novel , less thinky , less left-field-funny , with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true . what i mean is : a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor . but at least sgrh is a species of comedy . i have n't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies , and accounts for at least <NUM> % of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts . excelsior ? ( ex-cel-si-or ( n. ) slender , curved wood shavings used especially for packing ( originally a trademark ) ) . this set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours . one , and only one , sketch makes me laugh out loud : the phenomenon of `` monster parties '' ( as documented in novelty songs such as `` halloween shindig '' , `` dracula 's pajama party '' and the like ) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid tv grammar . original , bent premise anchored by yet another simultaneously vicious and sympathetic david cross performance . for the most part , the gang seems tired , like they 're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny . surely , anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass .
raven on her own is sophisticated , but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy ! as are most of these tracks not by real artists with cds , just kids stuck together . <NUM> of jesse mccartney 's worst songs - sorry ! some chisty c. romano tracks . `` anyone but me '' is a gem , get her ep instead . hayden 's `` my hero ... '' is great also , this girl can sing ! she 's also on the ice princess sndtrck ( `` i fly '' ) which i recommend in addition to `` go figure '' if they let her , she has a huge future
i was walking around the local library the other day and came across multiple books on writing . to my surprise , the public library had more books on writing than the college library . i thought to myself , `` i 've been looking for these kind of books to enhance my writing ! '' so i grasped this book in my hands and began reading away . as i continued through this book , i began to notice the editorial commas . i slowly connected the truth of the book 's title to the content of the book : this was a book based around press and media writing . i found a nice and quiet place to read at the library 's local history room and then sat down near a desk . while reading , i decided to give this book a review , so i wrote down notes in a notebook . however , my logic and learned way of writing may or may not conflict with one from the press ; but i felt that errors and other press related style and/or punctuation was not pointed out soon enough . therefore , i was confused as to the difference between press writing and academic writing , and may have created a biased review . i would have liked the differences pointed out . please do n't smack me with the stupid stick for having errors in this review : i 'm still working on my english . with that being said , onto the online * evil smirk * book review . e-mail vs. email : as much as i admire a businessman becoming a writer for the journal of technical writing and communication , he forgot one thing : e stands for electronic ! instead of being <NUM> , he went on this long rant about being an `` oldbie '' on the web and a javaslinger ; he coded his first page in raw html ( javascript ) . i 'm oldschool , but at least i understand why it was called `` e-mail . '' something that i found silly was his inability to appeal to authority . let me ask you something : if the owner of ebay were to write up a report about his or her company and list the company 's name multiple times through the report , then would you accept that as the correct spelling ? i would . case closed . appeal to creator wins . possible error at the top paragraph on page <NUM> : `` the first example , however , places 'and added ' in a parallel position ; thus the 'and added ' clause is made dependent on the ... '' let 's look at the semicolon and the word `` thus '' . last time i checked , a person is suppose to use a comma after and independent marker ; thus , a comma comes after 'thus ' . is the missing comma suppose to be some type of associated press ( ap ) writing editorial punctuation ? you could smack me with a stick for not reading the ap style guide , but it would have been nice if the author and the copyeditors noted what was going on . some of the material and possible errors at this point make me question if i should continue reading the book . i looked up semicolon in the index , and it was about <NUM> or so pages ahead of the past page i was at . i noticed the semicolon was feared by the author and not brought out in detail . i 'm not chuckling . i 've questioned a few of the matters in this book . i 've been able to accept press vs. academic so far , but i 'm starting to get concerned if what i 'm learning is correct or not . i grabbed the book from the library to learn . however , if these are mistakes , then i 'm a novice writer learning mistakes that were n't meant to be mistakes . i do n't think that 's a good way to learn how to write . do you ? let 's go to the their vs. his or her debate : i do n't care who or what you are , i 'm going to use his or her . if something is singular , it 's going to stay that way . i do n't approve of the media or some other brainwashing superpower to change the rules of english grammar . this is why i 've got to love some of the reviews on amazon.com . people do n't seem to care about grammar . makes me feel like someone is trying to sell me snake oil and the people around me are conspiring with the retailer . apparently , i 'm not the only one that feels this way . not after reading the rest of the reviews here . may i mention that amazon.com was advertised in the book ? yeah . thanks for dumbing down grammar . another section was where he used a comma instead of a semicolon to creates sentences like the following : page <NUM> : i like trix , i like lucky charms , and i like cocoa pebbles . maybe i 'm missing something here ; maybe he was trying to detail something ; maybe he 's adhd and forgot ; and maybe the book is adhd . i like trix , lucky charms , and cocoa pebbles . thank you parallelism . a person is suppose to use a semicolon instead of this serial comma junk he 's selling ; however , this could be a style concern . another entry about style and its concerns with semicolons could have been inserted . yeah . i 'm done reading after <NUM> pages or so . at least i read more than a fifth of the book . parts of the book i liked : introduction to brackets . it may not have been correct , but i understand what it 's about . `` i 've written a stylebook that i hope makes the following point : be skeptical of stylebooks . '' you seem to have accomplished your goal : your book makes me borderline schizophrenic
the music on this anthology disk is very bad . you have to `` want '' to like the germs . you must have alternative motives . your mind must already be set before you press `` play '' for the first time . maybe somebody cool that you know liked the germs or maybe they were name dropped in a magazine you like or that guy from the offspring wearing his blue circle logo germs t-shirt is burned deep in your psyche ... maybe you just like the name `` germs '' ? it is a cool name for a band and they do have a cool minimalist logo . if you were to first encounter this music blindfolded wearing headphones and without any knowledge that this music is the germs , you would likely rip off the headphones , take a couple asprin and run for the hills . why ? because this music is just plain bad
leans towards the blues side.heartfelt vocals.lacking licking licks.less driving than their debut
this is easily the worst sinatra/riddle/capitol record and i 'm not surprised it 's been unavailable for years.sinatra wanted to record something with the hollywood string quartet and this is the result . he 's in wonderful voice , but the material stinks and riddle 's scores are painfully dragging . he simply does n't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing . `` blame it on my youth '' is the standout , but you can keep the rest . the emperor has no clothes on this one
mike jones is n't anything different . still tippin is talking about what every other rapper has already covered . who cares if your `` tippin '' on <NUM> 4s ? all the other songs are just basic rap songs with no real meaning . also , how many times does this guy need to say his name or give out his phone number ?
this book doesn ` t compare very well with any other recipe books you will have seen - there are no pictures of the finished dishes for a start . a lot of the `` celebrities '' you won ` t have heard of - that shouldn ` t matter if the recipes are good . its a very american book and doesn ` t travel well ; the quantities are measured in `` cups '' , oven temps quoted in fahrenheit only and products not available anywhere else ( what are `` graham crackers '' ? ? ) there are lists at the back of bands with food names and songs with food names ( brilliant journalism girls ) and the authors thank you pages are hilarious - thanking their cats and themselves for the joy-filled experience of working with each other . i realise a recipe book has to have some simple ones included , but hot rod hot dogs - buy some hot dog sausages , buy some white buns , add some relish and mustard . enjoy ! peanutbutter on toast sandwiches , buy some peanutbutter , toast some bread . enjoy ! they ` re having a laugh , aren ` t they ? but this book is supporting a charity . it doesn ` t actually say how much of the proceeds are going to freedom from hunger , just `` some '' ..... so i suggest you give your donation directly to the charity instead of buying thi
i love this movie ! it is so incredibly stupid and funny . it is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass . the grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns . the film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated tv special . this is n't as stupid as barney , because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny , rather than just childish and retarded . this film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com , so be sure to rent it before you buy it .
everyone who reviewed this piece o ' crap <NUM> star had the right idea . now , let me drive the point home further : this song is pathetic . billy joe should really quit whining about how he `` walks alone '' . after all , green day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame nirvana retread . so sorry , but you do n't walk alone . maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money , i would n't be so opposed to this song . i 've heard it said that this song has emotion . that 's great ... where ? i know it 's not in the bored way billy joe sings his uninspired , typical `` nobody-loves-me-even-though-i'm-also-a-rock-star-and-i-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-i'm-a-sellout-i'll-sing-about-being-a-loser '' lyrics . you want emotion ? listen to bell bottom blues by derek & the dominoes . you can tell that eric clapton meant every word he said . with this annoying track , all you can tell is that green day is a highly overrated group . if they do n't stop playing this song , and fast , i do n't know what i 'll do .
honestly , i think this is horrible nothing catchy or good about it .. all the songs sound the same just nothing syticks out ... there last cd was the same thing but a little better . if your gon na buy one bleeding through cd i recommend portrait of the goddess ... stay away from thi
i think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing . weird . buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them . it 's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind . hardcore sublimers may want it , but you never really have to open it .
if you like warmed-over syd barrett , here 's your guy . a few nice tunes but becomes monotonous very quickly . stoltz ca n't sing worth a damn - i 'd like this a lot more if his vocals were wiped and a real singer overdubbed
my daughter 's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron . i thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge . soon after i noticed that my daughter was acting upset , when i asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song . i have n't seen her this upset about anything in a long time . even after i explained to her that it was just a story and not real she still was upset for the rest of the night . i know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children , but i 'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it . i have removed the craft that she made so she does n't need to be reminded of it . i know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well
this book is very vague . i found the main characteristic of prof. tanenbaum 's book is that he likes to use abstract algebra to deliver his example . for example , in chapter <NUM> he talks about languages , levels and vm . he uses l0 , l1 , l2 to represent languages and m0 , m1 , m2 to represent virtual machine . for people already have prior knowledge of programming such as c , java , when they read this they could easily reference to something they have already studied , but for me i still can not relate them very well . in contrast , in randal e. bryany & david o'hallaron 's book , the beginning of book gives out a concrete example : the c programming language . i found the latter always work better even after took the architecture course two years later . my point is for people who want to have clear idea of real world , you should pick another book . this book might be suitable for architecture theory ( hopefully ) .
what a hateful album this is . each song , a classic in it 's own right , eviscerated by this glorified club singer . the song `` it was a very good year '' illustrates my point , you hear williams 's voice , and it 's dire , but then to have sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed . i would be surprised if this sells even one copy , especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this . which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original ? do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs , if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh
if you must watch this film , watch it for winkler , who gives an interesting preview of his future role in `` arrested development '' . watching this movie for `` prinz '' and `` stiles '' is counterproductive . not only have the actors `` failed to make the best '' of the script , the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences . thus , we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school , muse about becoming `` singer-songwriters '' , and `` stop paying attention '' to their college plans . much like the `` friends '' genre that this movie shamelessly imitates , this is a `` time porn '' piece , where the characters have little else to do besides `` mature romantically '' and `` find themselves '' . a movie for history 's circular file
after i read erik larson 's wonderful book `` the devil in the white city '' i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes ' story . but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment . the production is amateurish at best , complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of `` mondo carne . '' with such a wealth of fascinating information available ( court transcripts , etc ) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened ? this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland . truly disappointing . perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes . this most certainly is n't it
anyone ever see any of these rap `` artists '' perform live ? they 're the most boring , derivative `` entertainers '' in the world . they walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and yell their lyrics . they go from talking on records to yelling on stage . quite a stretch . all this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying `` yeah ! '' `` uh-huh ! '' `` what ! '' `` that 's right ! '' `` uh ! '' etc . get real . meanwhile , the only `` music '' provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage . it makes for the most dull , predictable `` concert '' you 'll ever see . i ca n't wait until all this nonsense just disappears . in a world of common sense , these idiots would still be flipping burgers at mcdonald 's .
the last time i saw the names `` adam goldberg '' and `` giovanni ribisi '' together , they were two american soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain private ryan . goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long . at times towards the end i was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to `` memento '' or something of that nature . what this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels , that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution . some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning . despite a stellar cast that besides rabisi also features jason lee , christina ricci , vince vaughn , haylie duff and elvis costello , it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey . rabisi stars as gray evans , a movie star actor who is having marital trouble . gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set , going through fan email , and getting bugged by people , that a fan is stalking him . relentless in his obsession of this belief , he starts obsessing about others around him . great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales . we understand that gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time , of being the stalker , but by the time <NUM> minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring . the ideas are there , i just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all . the sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing , and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat . if you like independent films , or want to try something different , by all means give it a try . i do n't see it as being something i would watch again , or have in my collection for killing time on a sunday afternoon with
i am very disapointed with my purchase <NUM> of the songs on my wison pickett c d were damaged the disc looked new but the recordings of these songs were ruined they did not pla
this cd does not have the original artists performing the songs , which is all that really needs to be said about this cd . i normally would have listened to cuts from the cd , but i do n't have a sound card at work and made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it . still , you should n't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if a cd with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it
the author like so many others lumped all christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one . no , not all christians are the same . furthermore , the author took many verses in the bible out of context , rather than choosing to see it as a whole , he instead sees it in pieces , as being contradictory , not bothering to take seriously why the bible made certain statements
dull and uninspiring , listening to this cd i could n't see what distinguished the doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene . if you like the white stripes , franz ferdinand , arctic monkeys , the killers then be grateful that they 've saved rock music from boring dross like this
sorry , i 'm a big fan of the first two d.f . cds . anxiously awaited the third ... bought it without hesitation ... mmm , sadly disappointed . the magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart . cosmic , mysterious and almost spooky . so fitting to the groups name , deep forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world . comparsa on the other hand , though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to expand their creative global conquest , fans like myself feel abruptly misdirected . harsh , tinny , fast latin rhythems , overwhelm a majority of the otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks . i just ca n't seem to kick back and drift away with this latest endeavor . unfortunatly , it reminds me more of a nature company latin sampler ( do n't get me wrong , i love the works of groups such as b-tribe ) . but if you 're expecting more of the same to come out of this beloved duo , get ready for a hard right . perhaps their next albumn will return to a kinder , gentler world
this movie should have won an oscar . the acting was superb . kate capshaw and elle mcpherson were so convincing as lesbians . their common interest of jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians , but them ( of course ) , is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes . the writing is amazing . the nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more . stockard channing was aspiring as a pyschologist . she made me feel like i could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant . the stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life . the twists and turns provided in the three sisters story was like a m night shyamalan movie . i wo n't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise ! all in all i feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss . with dialogue like two men saying ( ... ) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like alice or claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - i feel like i should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber
i was trying to watch it , but can not open de dvd because it is the wrong country code ? ? ? ?
the first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other , and , as such , is unavoidably boring . the second third of the movie features a game of charades , which is embarrassing . the final third of the movie , though often self-indulgently mediocre , does possess some tension and drama , though it 's largely derived from people 's being mean to each other . not my idea of a good time
first cd of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out. can not believe they lasted that long.i remember seeing these guys open for alice cooper on his 'trash ' tour.talk about your suck-support acts.simply love some of the song titles here , like their mtv video `` naughty naughty '' and `` bang bang '' .like , how long did it take for them to think those up ? other hair bands i do n't care for include trixter , warrant ( after cd no.2 ) and firehouse.total waste of time , money and effort.i 've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of white lion , faster pussycat or poison.do n't you dare ! danger danger does n't even come close.avoid at all costs
i liked the first two afterhours compilations , mostly because they are so downbeat and emotional . there was a concept in those albums . now global underground ( in my point of view , a very unrespectable company or `` label '' ) gave the opportunity to amateur computer-music geeks to become a part of what was a fine series of compilations ( and good compilations are so hard to find ) without using any criteria . there is a lack of criteria also at choosing unrepresentative tracks by major artists like cinematic orchestra and gusgus . two stars , because i only like no more than four songs . and they 're no big deal at all .
charles band invites you into his dull graveyard ... this movie starts with a little girl playing with a bunch of dolls . she mistakenly bumps into a table and breaks a vase . her father comes downstairs and decides to punish her by forcing her to bury her little buddies in a grave outside . she somehow trips and falls into the grave , killing herself . dad buries the daughter with her beloved toys . flash forward to thirty years later , a new family has moved into the house . the youngest son is a nerdy geek who likes to collect action figures . imagine his joy at discovering a whole gaggle of antique dolls buried in his back yard ! these dolls come to life and start protecting their new owner by killing everyone that ever picked on him . there are no spoilers here , i 'm not giving away anything that is n't on the back of the dvd case . charles band returns to what he knows best , making evil puppet horror movies . but just because this is what he knows best , does n't mean he 's any good at it . this is really just a reboot of puppet master and demonic toys with a new set of evil dolls . the production is shoddy , shot on a cheap dv camera with horrible lighting and a soundtrack that someone did on a casio keyboard from <NUM> . not to mention the fact that the puppets are the best actors in the movie . ever since charles band came out of retirement or hiding , the blockbuster shelves have been graced with horrible full moon movies that are a few pegs below what they used to be . even in his prime , charles band was nobody 's genius , but time has definitely taken its toll . titles like decadent evil , doll graveyard and the gingerdead man prove that you ca n't keep a hack director down . band is back , folks .
what 's wrong with bhg ? besides everything ? is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives ? my sister burned this cd from a friend , most likely because she likes the bad touch song , and i 've been the one having to hear it in the morning when she 's getting ready for school . it 's pathetic . i do n't know how much i can stress the word `` pathetic '' , but it 's the only way to fully describe it . out of <NUM> tracks , there 's one , count it , one good song , `` the inevitable return of the great white dope '' , because it 's nothing like their other songs . everything else on this album is just like `` fire water burn '' , `` the bad touch '' , `` hell yeah '' , you get the picture . palm-muted , droning , songs with extremely explicit lyrics , which is the only reason people will remember them . is n't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage ? having lyrics about sex wo n't get you any . bands like blink-182 , sum <NUM> , and system of a down have funny songs , but they have their limits . about the `` music '' : <NUM> ) palm-muting does n't make a song good . i get it . you can palm-mute . so can most people who play guitar or bass . <NUM> ) make your music more diverse and varied , or at least change your patterns . elastica 's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns , except they play faster , and the songs are n't much longer than two and a half minutes long ( not that i 'm comparing bhg to elastica ) . <NUM> ) do what you do `` best '' , and do n't try metal . `` magna cum nada '' is bhg 's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish . stop . the problem with bloodhound gang is that they just wo n't die . people like them somehow , and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses , not saying that they were ever good . why do n't we go through the songs and rate them , shall we ? <NUM> . i hope you die : see track <NUM> <NUM> . the inevitable return of the great white dope : best song by bhg , but still not great . <NUM> . mama 's boy : see track <NUM> <NUM> . three point one four : see track <NUM> <NUM> . mope : see track <NUM> <NUM> . yummy down on this : see track <NUM> catch my drift yet ? i do n't think i can fully show my displeasure with words . `` <NUM> star , because <NUM> is not an option '' is exactly correct . people , if you actually want bloodhound gang , copy it from someone . maybe if they see their record sales go down , they 'll actually think about quitting . p.s . track <NUM> is called `` this is stupid .
as a sales pitch for tellington touch , this book is great . as an instruction manual , it is totally worthless . complex gestures such as those mentioned in the book need illustrations that take one step-by-step through the manipulation process . there are n't any , just a few photos that show one stop action part of the whole . it did get me to take a t-touch workshop , which was beneficial for my old and arthritic dog . the process works . the book does n't
i am a fan of historical fiction , and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public , who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have , will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them . why tamper with history , when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie .
even though kathryn kay was mentioned as a former vogue doll employee , her doll `` ginger '' by the cosmopolitan doll & toy corp. was not illustrated and with absolutely no information . this book is otherwise recommended for vogue dolls only
i really did n't like this . the idea for the seer was interesting enough , i suppose , but it was n't executed well . and vesputo ... first of all , who the heck names a character vesputo ? it screams cliche . anyways , he was just sort of ... semi-evil . like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of generation x with the goatee and the shirt that says `` i am the villan '' or some other rot like that . it just did n't work . and the whole ... 'random assasination of the king ' thing was n't done that well . i had to read it twice , because i was like `` eh ? what the * heck * just happened here ? '' . and the romance was something that you 'd expect a third grader to write ... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it 's all `` my love ! '' and they have n't seen each other for what , a decade or so ? it 's kind of ridiculous . so all in all , it 's something like three and a half stars for concept , minus two for execution . but amazon does n't let me do half stars
personally , i like the other albums from staind . i love `` dysfunction '' , i like `` break the cycle '' , `` <NUM> shades ... '' was tolerable , and i really enjoyed `` chapter v '' . however , even for a debut , `` tormented '' just sounds inmmature . there 's emotion , but i lost count on the how many times the `` f-word '' is not only mentioned on the album , but on each song alone . then again , fred durst produced this band in the first place , so that probably had a lot to do with it . all in all , the album itself just flat out sucks
it is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by bad boy records . the transformation from their classic hit `` on the outside looking in '' along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad . i 'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground , and it hurt 'em . some will say `` well thats what you get for being a sell out '' but if your in the game making underground hits for almost <NUM> decades and your only know to a small region , you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve . i forgive them , not puffy . buy some of their old stuff
i 'm not sure what i 'm supposed to be expecting from a `` classic eploitation/revenge '' film , but if this is it i 'd say the genre died a just death . as many reviewers have pointed out , there are simply fatal problems with this film . the sex scenes are utterly awful , like they are from an instructional film . christina lindberg is beautiful , but do n't expect any thrills from her outside of some decent lesbian scenes . the lack of music and sound create a claustrophobic feel , but with this kind of film i can never tell if that 's intentional or just the result of piss-poor production values . the `` action '' scenes are almost all in slow-motion which is simply too slow and robs the scenes of any sense of real violence . i do n't know why people go for this kind of movie . i think tarentino has some sort of complex : he feels guilty for using the kind of production values he does , while the movies he grew up on looked and sounded like this one . he should get over it though , there 's nothing wrong with a movie that looks and sounds good , and does n't make you feel akward while you watch it . there 's little `` rough '' or `` shocking '' in this movie , its just not very well done . it 's interesting as a period piece , and its cool that i have a limited edition ( though it is not numbered as other reviewers have pointed out ) , do n't think of this as an investment though , in a few more years , no one 's going to care ...
well the band sounds like a yellow card , simple plan , panic at the disco , all american rejects etc . all of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy . and you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio . if your older <NUM> and up . you need to get in to some good music . try the ramones , the offspring , sex pistols or even green day .
i , also , must second mark twain . this book is a waste of time ! why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading tolkien , gk chesterton , cs lewis , and the like ? agh . then , that could just be my wacky taste in novels ... but this was bad . oh my gosh ! ! ! the descriptions were always needlessly long , the conversations always needlessly long , the ... blah , blah , blah , blah . that 's what the whole thing was . blah . the whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short <NUM> pg novel and it would have been a million times better ! maybe even good ! and i like long books ! this book is terrible . listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time !
this is one of the worst textbooks i have ever used . the book uses lame metaphors . the style of writing is also horrible . it is very hard to understand and has a lot of `` fluff '' information . i do not suggest any ap us history students to read this for the ap exam
i am a fan of michael crichton 's . having said that , i felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy , and that certain characters were not well developed at all ( e.g . the wife ! ) the basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful ; it moved along at a fast pace . however , crichton added too many characters , and made the book too dense . i had to skim the last several chapters because i wanted to know what happened at the end , but i was getting extremely bored . obviously , he has come a long way since this book : - ) sigrid
the orchestra was small and the instrumention poor . most of the pieces were short in comparison to the original movie scores , and tempos of some of the pieces were so different from the original movie scores that it made listening frustrating
i ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80 's best contributers to the synth-pop genre , human league , said that on the audio liner notes portion of their & quot ; very best of & quot ; album . the three former members of this group left in the early '80 's and formed their own music group , being heaven <NUM> . i 'm sorry to say that , having listened to this album one night this past week , i find the cd 's entire song selection , in my opinion , to leave a whole lot to be desired . i do n't even remember any of the titles , and i ca n't understand how any of these purely mediocre tunes ever could have been a hit in any country . that is essentially it for me , the reason i did n't give this album only one star is that , thankfully , it 's not the absolute worst i 've ever heard . i do n't think that my taste in music could possibly be that bad , i 've got taste , decency , dignity , integrity , and a reputation to uphold after all
i love jane , but i 'm going to have to return this cd because the dualdisc will not play in either my car or on my computer . worthless to me , i have no idea if the music 's good or not , since i ca n't get it to play
exiled cubans in miami up to <NUM> . this is real old stuff . i wonder why this book is still being published . felt like a collection of shorter magazine -- newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book . many long , disjointed sentences . could use an updating . there must be better books out there about this topic
it has come to our attention that the book `` the theory of everything : the origin and fate of the universe '' has been published . professor hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book . the text was written by him many years ago , however the material has already been published in books such as ' a brief history of time ' . a complaint was made to the federal trade commission in the us in the hope that they would prevent the publication . we would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that professor hawking was involved in its creation .
delightfully short in length , `` the good body '' takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read ... which is a blessing . the repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape , the body is good . there is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader , and nothing one has n't read or heard beforehand . regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth , the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape do still make a difference in a woman 's life choices and success . this feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of `` feel good about yourself '' books in the <NUM> 's , <NUM> 's and <NUM> 's .
more predictable than an old tv land episode of bonanza and much less entertaining , this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons , one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system , one an idealist , and the middle son , tristan , played by brad pitt , a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature 's anger . at least that 's what i think he was doing . the fact is i never was a fan of this movie , not back in the <NUM> 's when my best friend loved it ( and predicted julia ormond would be a superstar -- sorry , gina , if you ever read this , i just could n't resist working that in there , ha-ha ) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing . i do n't think there 's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone . it 's not spectacular in its setting , it 's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story , and i found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring . to each his own , i know some love this movie , but from where i sit , this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
its a good thing i downloaded this for free . because aint no way in hell i 'd buy it
the breakdance trio are back . this time around they 're trying to stop the demolition of a community center . and at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly 's - lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone 's - adolfo quinines - feelings towards kelly and turbo 's - michael chambers - love interest . if the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and bad costume design . even ice t sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents . but , if you liked the first movie , like me , then you ca n't resist buying this sequel . at least you 'll see turbo 's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly 's not that bad acting . otherwise avoid .
clearly john gardner is a literary genius , however not being one myself i found that his style was a little overbearing , it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that i was looking for .
the software supplied will not install on windows <NUM> . the website of the publisher offers a zip to correct . however the links to download do not work . email sent to publisher seeking assistance was returned
great book , but amazon have made a serious mistake in the description . they say it is `` leather bound '' . it is most definitely not leather bound . it is leatherette , which is not leather . leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic . do n't be fooled . it is not leather bound . i bought one and was very disappointed . i told amazon , but they did n't want to know and i see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not
i remember around <NUM> , nba inside stuff did a feature on b.j . armstrong ( my favorite player ) of the chicago bulls . b.j . said that his favorite song was `` mr. dobalina '' . i remember thinking , well , if b.j . armstrong likes this guy named del tha funkee homosapien , then he must be good . and yes , del 's first album `` i wish my brother george was here '' is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic . so i recommend that album over this one ( it 's cheap too ) . del was at his creative peak with that first album ; it featured great production from ice cube ( back when ice cube made good albums instead of movies ) . since then , his career 's been a mixed bag . his cd 's are very inconsistent . a best of cd is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd 's . but i think you 'd also be better off buying `` deltron <NUM> '' and `` i wish my brother george ... '' instead
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone . the movie is a nokia product placement , highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and , conversely , what a phone can do for you if you have one . the plot centers on jessica ( kim basinger ) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need . mystery # <NUM> : what is it ? after lots of running/driving in various parts of l.a. the bad guys round up jessica 's family , while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them . mystery # <NUM> : how will the cell phone save the day ? mystery # <NUM> . watch for the credits at the end of the film . they show up on a ... ? yep , you got it
the album is too short , mainly due to the duration of each song . only <NUM> titles . need to review personal objectives prior to purchasing
rabi maharaj is confused about hinduism , the `` culture-religion '' in which he was born and raised . except the part that he was born in a hindu family , rabi is totally ignorant of the concept of god in hinduism . christians worship one & only god in three persons ; hindus worship one & only god in trillions of forms . fact of the matter is , this concept of one & only god , started during rig vedic period in india , at least <NUM> years before the birth of hebrew civilization in the land of cannon . the hindu rig veda 1:164:46 states `` ekam sat viprah bahudha vadanti -- -- `` there is only one god [ truth ] , but sages call that god many names '' . another ancient hindu scripture yajurveda <NUM> : <NUM> states `` na tasya pratima asti '' [ there is no image of him ] ... another hindu scripture svetasvatara upanishad 4:19 states `` his form is not to be seen ; no one sees him with naked eye . '' ravi should also know that hindus do not worship icons but like everybody else use `` icons '' to concentrate on a god who has `` no name or form . '' i have a question for rabi and the great apologetic , radio-tv talk show guest dave hunt . you quote thousands of verses from the holy bible , when ever you wanted to talk , preach and write about christianity . so my question to you , `` why you failed to quote even one verse from a hindu scripture to prove your arguments against hinduism ? in my review , i quoted many verses from the hindu scriptures to prove hindus worship only one god . why authors of this book failed to quote not even one verse from a hindu scripture to prove their arguments ? how can you ridicule or condemn a culture/ religion like hinduism about <NUM> billion people on earth practice , with out even quoting one verse from a hindu scripture ? unless by writing this book their intention was to follow the foot steps of dr. joseph goebbels , propaganada minister of the third reich who said , `` repeat a lie thousand times and it becomes the truth . ''
i 'm a big sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection is n't of interest to me . but the omissions of do n't let it end , why me and love at first sight prompted me to give this a poor rating . i guess anthology does n't technically mean best of or greatest hits , but i hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out . i would recommend getting greatest hits and greatest hits part <NUM> if you 're just looking for a styx collection
barber 's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism . it works , somewhat , but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question . not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology , as the war in iraq has shown us .
if you want a greatest hits package from reba mcentire , get her first or her second one . this one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to `` do what sells '' . this collection is phony ... just like the lady herself .
for some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced , one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy . unfortunately it is not the case . the album is more for floyd 's fans who are eager to have all the small details.well , personaly i do n't care that much about these details , all i want is the true staff , for that i would recommend to those who are hesitating , do n't buy this dvd , buy the cd ... or wait for the true dark side of the moon
i read recently that sheryl crow 's song `` good is good '' a song from her new album , was nominated for a grammy award . seriously , how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that . tnmc , also won a grammy when it was released . i still can not understand why , but i do have a theory . simply put , the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity . while only a mediocre talent at best , sheryl crow is deified . i realize that this is only my opinion ( and i have a right to state it ) this type of music nauseates me . there is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated . do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek . i do have a solution : all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned `` crimes '' should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some `` soul . '' peace
eight long years after this album was released and i figure i might as well write a review . i know what people say , that , it was n't the downward spiral <NUM> . well , i was hoping for something equally as impressive as the downward spiral , not the same . i realize bands move on , grow up , get old , but , such a contrast . the downward spiral , and previous works , were a progressive movement towards something .. something . the fragile may have been that something . the world will never know . i wonder ... who will hold the chalice next ? blame it on fear , blame it on drugs , blame it on pressure , blame it on whatever , but , this album is the ultimate opportunity lost . successive works , such as `` with teeth '' , are just flat out laughable . was nine inch nails ever a great band ? i have my doubts ... yet , i can still remember being dumbstruck by the glory of mr. self destruct that first time ... as far as i 'm concerned , this album was trent 's fall from godhood . this album has no purpose , no progression . it 's a mess of half committed tracks and trivial ambience . there is no plot , no experience . while downward spiral was a journey to something divine , this album , however , lacks any magic whatsoever . this album will not change you . oh , nin will still be around , perhaps for ten more years , perhaps even twenty . but , that spirit , that anger , that power which is found in the downward spiral and broken will never show itself again . the sincerity is but a fading memory , and to those just discovering nin , will never be felt . all in all , i would rather have never been born than live in a post fragile world . it was that disapointing to me , and still is . one star for destroying one of the only joys of my childhood
i consider golijov the britanny spears of new music . he re-hashes what others have done , albeit with less originality than britanny , all the while making me nod off
even though i would agree that `` erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in `` pretty woman . '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good `` david and goliath '' story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the `` true '' story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones . however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the `` xena '' character is the main attraction in `` xena : warrior princess '' ( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character ) . erin brockovich is a vain , brassy , boorish , single mother of three young children , with no marketable work skills , a transparently opportunistic manner , who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in `` pretty woman '' ( prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree ) . the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident ; her lawsuit is lost , primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony ( swearing , cursing and shrieking from the witness stand ) while being questioned by opposing counsel . unbelievably , erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's ( played by albert finney ) firm , mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk . later , while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill , pro bono , real estate sale , erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records , that , for reasons she ( correctly ) does not understand , seem to be of particular interest to the buyer , the mega utility company , pacific gas and electric . erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg & e had ( for decades ) negligently contaminated the ground water ( surrounding one of their power plants in/near hinkley , ca on the edge of the mojave desert ) with toxic , hexavalent chromium . this discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits ( at least in terms of the award ) , in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg & e ( by and through the representation of erin 's boss ) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a <NUM> million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs . roberts gives a photogenic , if not especially gifted , performance in her role as erin . the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts ( literally gushing out skin-tight , low-cut , bustier-inspired `` work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet ) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents . while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit , she is not an especially likeable character ; rather , she is rude , verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests . albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry , the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss . the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing ; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work , the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts ( strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy , five-inched-heeled mules ) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters . aaron eckhart plays the affable , gentle biker and next-door-neighbor , george , who becomes erin 's boyfriend-by-convenience . the `` convenience '' factor is totally one-sided and for erin 's benefit exclusively ; she unabashedly uses george for free , live-in childcare , thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case . erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar `` bonus '' check ( from masry ) when the tort action case settles ; contrastingly , george gets a `` thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers . the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life , who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant . though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed , make no mistake-this movie is about erin brockovich ( indeed , i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present ) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening , generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face , due to the toxicity in their water source . erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience ( in typical hollywood fashion ) as a sort of heroine ; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people , walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich . is the movie entertaining-absolutely . inspiring- not even slightly .
jeez , maybe i am getting old , but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest . a brilliant scientist . disfigured . angry . finds temporary techie fix for face . goes to get bad guys . fighting . more fighting . still more fighting . ex mate learns he 's alive . he leaves her anyway ( he 's too ugly ) . the end . more to come , if successful . not recommended
this album contains one of the most annoying songs i 've ever heard in my life ... `` afternoon delight '' . the only good thing about that song is that is was so overplayed , that no one dares play it anymore while others are in hearing range ! :
i decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it . i watched it with my girlfriend . bad idea ... the sex scenes are bad and very short , and the rest is downright boring . this movie is simply bad , and slow , and generally laughable
clearly the worse she has ever came out with ! only one good song on entire cd ...
if you 're looking for good aftermath-produced or g-unit affiliated music , here 's which artists to go to and which to stay far , far away from : <NUM> cent -- go nowhere near the massacre . you 're <NUM> % more likely to suffer a slow , painful death just by touching the case . it is the worst cd you could possibly ever hear . same thing goes with the movie soundtrack . get rich or die tryin ( the original ) on the other hand , is solid ... especially on those bonus tracks ( heaven , life on the line , u not like me ) , patiently waiting , <NUM> questions , and anything featuring another g-unit member . pimp , with its lack of snoop dogg ( which the music video seemed to promise ) , high all the time , many men , and wanksta can kind of get old though . the thing about <NUM> cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all . he needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap . the reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with the game in the documentary and eminem in the re-up is because he has actually good rappers holding him up . he 's like the abbott of the comedians abbott & costello now . he has nothing worth contributing without his costello of some kind to be there for him . the game -- as soon as i heard this guy 's album and compared it to <NUM> 's massacre , i knew that if g-unit was going anywhere , this guy would be the one to take it there . and now it turns out he left . ca n't blame him when the clique-label 's leader is so dumb . was the most progressive rapper of the crew , and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive <NUM> 's massacre was . has the best , deepest subject matter within his songs , if not the best flow ( although his underground <NUM> bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums ) . as far as the mainstream and not underground cds go though , i 'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the g-unit crew . his documentary album has been called the third chronic , and has the best of dre 's beats you 'll find on any g-unit cd . criticisms are that he name-drops dre & nwa a bit too much , but overall , i think it 's not that big of a deal . he 's a big hip-hop history fan , and he 's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with dre . given a very brief profile of the rapper , he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype , ( average-looking rapper from compton who 's been shot a few times ) , but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the doctor 's advocate and his even better the documentary . young buck -- i 'd say probably the best g-unit member still in g-unit . this guy has the best flow , as far as mainstream cds are concerned . he also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world ( a.k.a . 'progressive ' ) , with references to the illuminati amongst other secret organizations . i like this guy the best of the remaining g-unit . 2nd best comes sort of close to him , but still does n't match buck 's raw skills . lloyd banks -- this guy is second best . his flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with the game 's , or at least land in that area . he , buck , and the game are my top three for g-unit ( even though the game 's not g-unit anymore ) . anybody else you can probably pass up . i 'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand . tony yayo -- the one male member who is worse than <NUM> cent . in the g-unit cd , they always shouted 'free yayo ! ' and now he is free . the g-unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release . his is of no benefit whatsoever to them . he might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of <NUM> 's style & outlook on life . joe -- the kind of r & b star you 'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an outkast track , mixed with a bit of r. kelley and a very small splash of stevie w. he 's not bad i guess . i hated him completely on ' wan na get to know you ' of the g-unit cd , but would definitely still listen to his 'ride wit u ' track off his own solo album . olivia -- pssh , are you dumb ? no . she 's partially responsible for candy shop . that should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back . she kind of ca n't sing either . bad move to make an r & b cd without being able to sing , i think . lil ' scrappy -- this is the same lil ' scrappy you heard on lil ' jon 's `` what u gon do ? '' track . he 's pretty good . decent at least . definitely not as decent as <NUM> cent 's original get rich or die tryin , but decent . he 's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in g-unit , excluding lloyd banks and young buck , but including <NUM> cent by himself . i think that 's everybody . so ... now you know all about g-unit , and who 's good and who 's not . if you have to buy g-unit , now you know who to avoid and who to embrace . if you plan on buying the original get rich or die tryin , i suggest you do n't . burn it , or have a friend burn it for you . <NUM> does n't need the money right now or ever again . if you decide not to buy g-unit , then more power to you . the game is actually now sort of the anti-g-unit since he left , because , you know , the majority of their members still suck . i 'd suggest mos def 's black on both sides instead of any of this stuff though ... even if you were planning on buying g-unit . that 's probably the best hip-hop album i 've ever heard , or will hear
this book has nothing to offer , except for those of you who now nothing about orisha tradition , and are curious . otherwise do n't waste your time and money ..
i ca n't believe the <NUM> star reviews this album gets . ( well , it probably deserves it more than yoko ono and syd barrett 's albums , which also get mostly <NUM> stars . ) `` golden years '' is an excellent track , one of bowie 's best ( wa-wa-wa ) .. the title track is pretty catchy too . but the rest of it is just depressing , dull songs with little of the originality that marked his hunky dory/ ziggy / aladdin sane era . he just ran out of ideas i guess . i can believe he does n't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all . i 've never considered david bowie a great vocalist , it 's a testament to the quality of his ziggy-era songs that you do n't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak , and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up . and the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter . i 'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums . but it 's not enough to save this lot of songs . i guess it all depends on what matters more to you , the quality of the song itself , or the vocalist 's ability . if you like the first , get ziggy stardust . if the latter matters more , get this album .
this series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle , feminism and the destruction of the nuclear , traditional family is one of the worst , most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the tv landscape -- although that is n't saying much since the ruinous , liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture . this desperate housewives series is rebukable on several , equally critical fronts . the first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness ; the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal `` values '' ; the third is its low class cast of monotonous , expressionless actors ; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to `` freshen '' its stale storyline . at the first season 's start , the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept : mary alice commits suicide , and this sets off the looming , boring storyline about the other four , remaining housewives `` intellectually '' attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season . at this point , the traditional and moderate american has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of mary alice . liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick , `` alternative '' debaucheries , and the show endorses this through the removal of mary alice ( mother ) from her family , where we only have a dad/son left . later on , the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of mary alice 's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents , mary alice and paul young . this show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family . other families include the divorcee ( teri hatcher ) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage ; flagrantly , feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men . another is the van de kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage , while one kid is a flaming , budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain . the next family involves the felicity huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly add/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids . the dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning , stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck -- an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life ! ! ! ! the last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia , through the eva longoria character preying on the high-school kid ( john ) , and also infidelity while she rapes him . by the rock-solid and sentencing examples above , it 's clear that the incorrigible theme of desperate housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family . this can not be defied ; only if you 're a moral relativist who practices pc can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment . the culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show , one marc cherry . cherry is a shamelessly , openly gay sodomite , and his `` alternative '' ( read : irreligious ) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection . using basic common sense , we see cherry 's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show 's plot twists , as cherry likely harbors much , personal resentment towards the traditional family , which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox , sodomite lifestyle . when cherry manufactures these scripts about bree van de kamp 's son being a closet homosexual who rebels , this blatantly is about cherry 's own , frustrated childhood . when cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up , this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally . to boot , this show 's acting by the four , enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable . hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon ; longoria is the slutty tramp ; cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion ; sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body ; and huffman acts like the frumpy housewife . their `` performances '' ( read : monotonous impersonations of people ) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed . in conclusion , desperate housewives is one of the worst , most irreparable shows to come out of un-american and liberal hollywood in years . it -- under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment -- unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme , and it attacks one of judeo-christian america 's most revered institutions : the traditional family . the show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it can not do so based on storyline , character development and interest alone . one severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored , lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony .
i purchased this album with such high hopes and when i popped it in to give it a listen , i was sadly disappointed . it was not the dj shadow that i knew . the majority of the tracks were rap , which would have been just fine if it had been good rap . it had no flow , no connection and was all over the place . i took a risk and purchased this album without looking at the reviews and i 'm sorry i did . always read the reviews ! ! ! !
maybe this book contains some good advice . but i gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it . i seriously doubt i 'll make it all the way through the book . the first part of the book talks about michael gerber 's ( fictitious ? ) mentee sarah , a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and ca n't get up . the conversations between michael and sarah are so contrived and syrupy , who can believe them ? sarah needs to climb a mountain in nepal , discover the meaning of life , and get it over with . the second part , which i 'm reading now , is structured around the <NUM> `` disciplines '' for building a company . i skipped ahead to this part , but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that i really feel lost not having read it . if you like business story books of the patrick lencioni variety , you might get something out of e myth mastery . but be warned : this book as many times longer than lencioni 's , with a lot less meat
after reading such good reviews , i decided to buy the cd . only to discover it is not my kind of music . this is like a kindergarten kind of music .
blast is a very well-coordinated show , as it is suposed to be . it employs a variety of different themes , instruments , and atmostphere , unlike , say , stomp . but blast does not feel like a theatrical piece . the majority of the show cold be played during a highschool football halftime or at an amusement park and could be well-recieved , but not in a theater . where the producers do attempt to showcase some artistic originality , they fail quite miserably . performers are enthusiastic , but they just do n't deliver the absorbing , fascinating dynamics that , for example , stomp does
just listening to few extracts of chopin sonata on amazon.com made it clear to me - i do n't want to hear the rest . let 's take the scherzo ( 2nd movement ) , for example . lang lang plays the middle episode not just `` a little slow '' but at least twice as slow . whereas if you look in the score you 'll see a strikingly different picture - chopin ( the composer ! ) asked for no tempo change , he never canceled molto vivace . unfortunately , it is very common when a performer changes things here and there , so it sounds so called original and `` deep '' , rather then trying to read attentively the composer 's code , understand and make sense of it . i trust chopin 's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing beauty .
this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant , in other words , what you learn here wo n't apply after the first <NUM> or <NUM> weeks . my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics , such as how to breastfeed properly , how to bottlefeed properly , how to swaddle properly , how to calm a baby properly , etc . all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn , each is given about <NUM> seconds of screen time . instead , the bulk of the program is wasted on things like `` pre-birth preparation , '' which interestingly appears toward the end of the program , and how the mother should take care of herself . these are important things to know , but not for a `` ultimate baby care dvd . '' the dvd packaging is also very misleading . it says `` over an hour of hints '' ... but that includes <NUM> minute of copyright warning and another <NUM> seconds of `` you should always consult your doctor '' warning , plus a long end-of-program credit . the actual content is about <NUM> minutes . i 've seen this dvd and the `` abc of newborn baby care '' dvd and even though the latter is not great , it 's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step , and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly . between the two dvds , i definitely recommend the latter . btw , you can likely find this at your local library . it 's also available from netflix . it 's just not worth the price of the dvd , not even 1/10 of the price
for an experienced financial professional , this text does not add much value . the book touches upon a great many subjects , but does not appear to cover any one in any depth . the book may be most appropriate as an introductory text on the subject on the undergraduate level but not as a practioner 's desk reference . as a professional with significant experience in investment banking with a cpa and mba , i was looking for in-depth guide to the specific mechnanics of the contoller 's function
i do n't think i 'm going to be around in <NUM> to give an accurate evaluation .i ' f i 'm still here i hope i still remember who neil young is , and i 'm still rocking in the free world
for the converted and knowledgeable about st. therese - you will be reaffirmed . for those looking for a good movie , you will be bored to tears ..
i expected so much better . the first two novels in this trilogy were very entertaining and managed to weave both dramatatic historical events with classic family tensions , particulary with the cheney sisters . each character including the tertiary characters were well defined . in this one , the other cheney sisters never even show up and unfortunately it is a glaring omission . predictable and boring from beginning to end . sadly , much like the heroine
this is like dull opera vs. trance . what a waist , i am mad i bought it
their first album & quot ; let 's get free & quot ; was a <NUM> star masterpiece , unfortunately this one is horrible . there are only <NUM> good tracks on this album , both which are deep and reminiscent of & quot ; let 's get free. & quot ; one is & quot ; sellin d.o.p.e. & quot ; and the other is & quot ; look around & quot ; which is already featured on beatnuts ' & quot ; musical massacre , & quot ; and to make things worse they chop off <NUM> minutes of the song . the other tracks are boring and uninspiring . they completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop . the beats are either recycled or & quot ; snare- happy , throw them bows & quot ; type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first cd . it 's much like a book with no pages . shine with no substance . it 's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots . i 'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old dead prez formula that made & quot ; let 's get free & quot ; so great . but until then , do n't pick this one up
the score to cast away is one of my favorites - right up there with ennio morricone 's underrated instrumentals for `` once upon a time in america '' - and it 's a real shame that , apparently , the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which does n't even feature the full soundtrack . luckily i got my hands on an academy awards advance album preview for cast away - the cd that universal sent to the academy awards crew for oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks . but i know there are more out there and i think it 's time the full soundtrack was released
this movie was so bad , i fell asleep watching it in the theatre . i normally like buddy films , but this one was just plain bad . the jokes were horrible , the acting was worse . reality tv fits into this movie seamlessly , which is probably another reason why i did n't enjoy it . i think `` reality '' programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business . to sum it all up , save your money , i 'm sure you can find a better way to spend it
i 've always loved the smothers brothers - they were so gifted , so funny . but like so many show business people , they fooled themselves into thinking they were more important , more informed , and had greater insight into life than everyone else . what is it about a singer or comedian or actor that makes them think they have a firmer grasp of politics or foreign policy than those who have spent their lives studying and working in the field ? this show just highlights that sort of egotistical celebrity folly - they sacrificed their sweet funny comedy act so that their political opinions could be heard - and all it accomplished was to make sure we did n't get to hear their funny comedy or their political opinions ! why do n't more entertainers just listen to laura ingrahm when she says - '' shut up and sing ! '' ? i quit watching the tv show when they got political and this program reminds me why i did .
i found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time . it 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning . the ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion . denzel washington did a great job playing the detective and john goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted . my recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money . buy somthing that has a good plot . d- is my ratin
i agree with the above review ; minimal information , absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying . meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books . he missed a few key chairs of note ; saarinen 's grasshopper chair and aalto 's armchair <NUM> ( zebra or tank ) chair . if you want a good welll rounded selection of modern chairs , i 'd suggest the <NUM> chairs book instead
i saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape , so before writing my review i decided to give the dvd a chance and you know what ? the picture quality on the dvd is n't much better ( if any ) than the videotape and the story still sucks . yea , vanity gets naked but it 's done in such an unsexy way that it 's well unsexy . she looked sexier with clothes on in the last dragon . the story if you can call it that is about vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend , one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together . soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him . the boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two , the gorilla and the man that is , with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her .
having been born in '86 , i unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70 's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80 's hardcore years . instead , i got to grow up with the mtv generation .... how so very lucky i am . yet , i figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as `` punk '' . so , if i could figure it out , any other idiot from this forsaken generation should n't have any problems . good charlotte is okay if you 're <NUM> years old , but if you 're <NUM> and you 're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff . if you 're my age and you listen to good charlotte then you are beyond any help . instead of good charlotte , buy or steal the real thing : subhumans : time flies + rats . it was the first one i picked up and it led to an entire collection of real , gritty , raw punk music . to all the good charlotte fans , take the advice i just gave you . go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it .
with a pacing that only tsai ming-liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy `` house of sand '' steps into the genre best described as the foreign doldrums . moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we did n't get along too well . the entirety of the movie takes place in the brazilian desert , a place that we movie fans rarely get to see . however , as you may have guessed , not a lot happens out there . there is n't even a weeping camel out there to keep us company . we watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere ( no explanation given ) and then dies , stranding everybody else there for three generations . i know , how can i criticize a plot for not having any developments ( other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt ! ) when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters . and to that i would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film . pretty much everything goes as would be expected . people walk around bored , some of them die off , there are some minor romances , and everything looks beautiful . about ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and aurea , the crazy man 's wife , desperate for anything that moves , strikes up a love affair with one of them . he promises to take her out of the desert , but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening . throughout more soldiers will arrive , and the females will always view them as tickets out of town , there to be seduced and exploited . do i believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny ? maybe , maybe not . in the end the point is made that living in the brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon , to which i would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart . another minor complaint i would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles . it would be fine , in a `` three times '' kind of way , had they bothered to label the passage of time . instead i was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave . there is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber , but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew . you have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this , and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off . `` rain '' and `` elephant '' leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique . these characters really may have been marooned out in no man 's land , but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away . i was n't lucky enough to have seen this in theaters , but i would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk . awe-inspiring cinematography does not make a movie . . .and here is my proof . * * 1/4
such a title should deserve better quality ... other cds of piazzolla are much better
if there is one thing michael bay is good at , it 's explosions .... big 'ol explosions . there are a lot of them in this film , along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers . this is a film that ben affleck & billy bob thornton ( both in the film ) admit to being ashamed of . pure `` leave your brain at the door '' entertainment .
i think irridium said it most articulately , but i just wanted to add to the hate for this book . i have never experienced such a strong visceral negative reaction to any work of literature . save yourself some time and read nabokov 's ada instead
i love this film . it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing . i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd , unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used . i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches . in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture . i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves . i 'd have given <NUM> stars if it had , so the minus three is for the appaling print . one of the worst i 've ever seen
i have read all of barbara delinsky 's books . of those books , there have been a number of rereleases . what is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this , and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback . if a book was released in <NUM> the price of the paperback should be lower , and the cover of the paperback should also have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current content untouched . i 'm from ottawa , canada and this paperback was very expensive . alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell
i was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because i felt like a traitor when i did n't like this book . i wanted to like it , i really did - but it was very dull . i ended up skimming most of it because it did n't hold my interest at all . the first chapter started out with a bang and i was totally hooked . it did n't take long to lose me . boooooring . i did n't like sophie , i did n't like royd ( royd - are you kidding ? perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there. ) . i was n't interested in the direction the book went . i thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes . if sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we would n't have had such a boring book . she was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time . royd was so very unlikeable i could n't believe they ended up in bed together . ick . adding jane into the book was very contrived . plain old artist jane and her cop stepfather joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer ? it seemed like a ploy to connect eve duncan with this book . not at all believable . the one sentence that i found interesting was when michael thought that jane resembled or looked like someone familiar . it seemed to be a lead in to the next book . the first ij book i ever read was ugly duckling . hopefully ij re-reads that one before starting the next one . give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [ ... ] .
do n't buy songs from this racist bastard ! ! ! ! and if he so-call `` hates everyone '' , why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the `` n '' word ? damn hick
the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition 's cover . however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances . the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen . with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes . the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story . the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. `` i 've made some cookies for tea , said ma '' . the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma 's . by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger , but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there , but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats . the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention . more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie . it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth . the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer . meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail . the final arrival for this story is grandma , with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table . not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table . the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home . the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me . the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them . at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down . for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest . there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child 's grandma 's cookies . there are roughly two to four sentences on each page . the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this
well . . . lem me see it was n't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored , although the opening sex scene with amber newman saved it all , the only reason i watch the film over and over and over again , i gave it a whole star just for that scen
jing wong truly sinks to a new low with this movie . jet has one oustanding action sequence but other than that , he just is n't used . jacky cheung is the star of this movie and plays an actor who absolutely never uses stunt doubles . it became apparent within <NUM> minutes that this movie was made to make fun of jackie chan . of course it did n't have to be so obvious but jing wong just keeps driving it into your head that he does his own stunts . so if you are familiar with jing then you know this is n't going to be a tribute to jackie . oh no , it is a punch to the throat through the movie screen . jet li plays cheung 's bodyguard and ends up doing the a stunt for him . after setting up his stupid jackie chan character , jing tries to do a remake of die hard . remember how you never knew what bruce willis was going to do and it was always surprising ? well jing makes about the worst movie possible from here on . instead of being clever , he makes jet just keep storming in on the hostages and then flee . at one point he takes a helicopter up and starts shooting right into the buiding at the main bad guy with all of the hostages standing around . after the helicopter crashes into the side of the building it does n't blow up , it just destroys everything on that floor . so other than one outstanding action sequence between jet li and ben lam ( guy with sunglasses ) , this movie is a complete waste of time . even billy chow could n't save this one . of course it would help if wong jing was smart enough to capitalize on the success of billy chow and jet li in 'fist of legend ' , but instead we do n't get to see them fight and get to look at billy chow in a thong . yeah , that it just what i am looking for . the universal laser and video company version is ok but the imbedded subtitles are sometimes hard to read . there is a version of this released by dimension video ( grrrr ) that has been retitled meltdown and has been shortened by <NUM> minutes and also has gotten a horrible new soundtrack including english dubbing and rap music replacing what was in the original . does n't matter which one you get because the chinese version is n't really any better since it is not a good movie to begin with .
i bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at amazon . what a major disappointment this disk is . embarrasingly amateur , with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses , it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well . another case of & quot ; dumbing-down & quot ; music for children , something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music ( the outstanding putamayo series for example is presented no frills , no dumbing-down ) . good & quot ; children 's music & quot ; inspires both parents and kids , and kids react positively to that in their parents . a shame to pay $ ... for this disk
there 's no spark whatsoever in spark . if you 're interested in the subject of co-creation read eric von hippel 's democratizing innovation instead . http : //being-reasonable.com/index.php/weblog/permalink/a_spark_that_wont_light_anyones_fire
uneven , choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable meryl streep . unfortunately , not even the fabulous ms. streep can save this -- recommended for devoted fans only , bent on completing their streep collection
ok , this movie stinks ! now that we have cleared that up , let 's take a look at why this movie should be watched . our story is about a post-apocalyptic world , in which the human race is forced to live undewrground ; in order to avoid contact with the radation that has killed life . as time goes on , two groups of survivors formed and did not get along . so , group <NUM> up and left and made for the earth 's surface again . this is where our movie starts . the group is a bunch of bikers and look like they came straight out of la , ca <NUM> . as they are settling in , the discover that there is some sort of ultra-smart , ultra-fast , ultra-carnivous species of rats on earth and there are large numbers of them . very cheesey and not worth more that $ 9.50 or $ <NUM> , but definatly worth watching . and , to all those weiners about these being real rats , get over it ! there is this perfectly legal profession in the united states that i 'm sure you would call for assistance if you had a rat problem ..... we call them exterminators ..... what 's the difference ?
mississippi and sugar baby are great songs , up there with the best dylan has done . however , the rest of the album , while listenable , is n't all that memorable . still , i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still , after over <NUM> years performing and recording . the same can not be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones . overall , time out of mind was better , although that too was a little overrated , with only not dark yet , standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs .
i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show . even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed - incorrectly - as there is no shania performance on the dvd . as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal - sorry ! !
i never read the book , but i hated the movie . the acting was weak , the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable . let 's hope they do n't make a sequel . the final straw was the avril lavigne song over the end credits
yes this cd will put you to sleep in minutes . its the most boring uninspiring classical music . the first cd was very good but this vol . <NUM> is like most movie sequels .... awful
... i mean , other than making a profit for the studio ( which , i understand , did not happen yet ) ... whoever wrote the script for this doofus movie ought to be re-trained , and put to work doing street-cleaning , or garbage pick-up , or something that he/she ca n't screw up ... better yet , re-train the actors and actresses involved because obviously they did this turkey for the paycheck alone and gave no thought whatsoever to the audiences that would have to sit through this drivel ... the premise of this film had potential , but someone , or , more probably , some committee decided , hey , we do n't want to make anything that is actually good ... heavens no ... what we want is a made-for-teevee spook story with a made-in hollywood big budget ... where did '' white noise '' go wrong ? almost from the begining ... so apparently some lower level employee of the michael keaton charecter is some sort of nutcase serial killer who just may be in the control of some trio of disembodied demons ... or something ... keaton 's pretty , pregnant second wife goes out for a drive and never returns .. did she slip , fall , and get carried away in the river ? ... apparently not ... apparently the afore-mentioned nutcase serial killer tortured and murdered her , maybe at the instigation of the demons ( or maybe just because he is a nutcase serial killer ... who can be sure ? ) ... anyway , one day some over-weight evp practioner comes along and tells the keaton charecter that the dead wife is contacting him '' from beyond '' ... spooky ? no , not really , as the overweight guy seems almost a buffon .. later we meet another pretty blonde who believes that chubby-cheeks has made contact with her dead boyfriend .. keaton hears a tape that may contain his wife 's static-filled voice , and he 's hooked .. later he sees tragic episodes before they happen ( and claim lives ) , and finds out that , maybe his dead wife is directing him to the scenes of local accidents , deaths , and worse ( again , we are never sure what exactly is going on ) .. then the big guy winds up dead , but not before telling the keaton charecter that there '' are a lot of bad people out there '' ( sort of like in real life ) .. keaton fails to prevent the blonde whose boyfriend may have contacted her '' from beyond '' from falling out of a high-rise apartment ( which would have killed you or i but did n't kill her ) , he goes to an uncompleted high-rise where some missing housewife is being tortured by his employee , is maybe attacked by demons and dies ... oh , sure , there is more to this loopy script , but why bother telling it ? i can write a better scarefest than this ... probably so can you ..
this one is for you . but honestly now , the guy does n't write -- beautiful voice -- but songwriting is a major appeal . so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake . ok , there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork , ( what a ) wonderful world , but generally this a very casual compilation , good for a couple listens . in general , art garfunkel is n't really good for more than that . check out him witht paul simon , that is amazing stuff , but this is kinda boring . i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs -- but even though there are good songwriters writing for him , the songs are still sub-par
the old timers like me back in the inner cities where smokey and the miracles orginally put their stake down in motown and r & b royalty , used to call him bill smokey robinson . whenever i meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in japan radios were blaring down the new york city school hallways playing the tracks of my tears , shop around , ooo baby baby ( which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the junior high school gym ) and the tears of a clown , all selections being on the ultimate collection~smokey robinson and the miracles , i know that my buddy remembers smokey 's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery . i apologize to my readers for run on sentences but smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul , r & b and the motown wall of sound ( they had one too ) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated . i heard that smokey recently brought his performance to flint , michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country . i really wish that i could have been there to see smokey put out before a hometown crowd . that must have been nothing short of a miracle . i am going to hit the click button now myself , i need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in junior high with the made in japans , fingerpopping all the way . please note , i meant to push <NUM> stars on this cd and can not figure out how to correct the above . i apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by smokey 's music probably realized this faux pas . jay adler , massapequa , new yor
this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website . very old version and took forever to get here
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on .... really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers . there are so many open ends in the story ... chartacters are not distinctly outlined ... tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
hitchcock said in interviews that the most important thing in a movie was if you do a flashback , the flashback must not lie to the people watching . if it does it distroys the trust we have placed with the film maker and hurts the feel of the movie . this first rule of his was thrown out the window with this below average hitchcock thriller . never before or after did hitchcock do this lie in the flashback thing . the acting is also well below what he was used to having in his movies . a rare misfire from hitch
i was n't sure if this was from a s. king writing or some child night mare of a writing ! it 's obvious that any one can write then have that book published . only the most outrageous of imagination could come with this fairy tale type of fantasia . sorry , but the author is searching for the truth in the wrong place ! you know ?
i was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews , but i could n't stand anything about the album . i hate good charlotte , they sound exactly like every other prep-rock band ( fall out boy , my chemical romance , simple plan ect . ) i could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the `` song '' names that this had nothing to do with life or death , and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs . after i listened to a couple of these so called `` songs '' i turned it off , and quickly threw it out of the window . my point being , with bands such as this , do n't expect anything hidden within the title , or the music . it will just be a boring listen the entire way through . if you were looking for an album that does have meaning , and is fun to listen too . i suggest eating your own exrement
i am so mad at disney and their movie `` hercules '' because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories . i like greek mythology , but the movies have not been good at all . and this weak effort is not going to do anything about it . the plot has been changed completly , pegasus is never mentioned in the real version , he is not trying to impress people , he had no trainer , the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned , the hydra fight is because of a different reason , ugly characters , hercules was never in love with a chick , hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either , and all kinds of things that i wo n't mention . do n't buy this movie because it is completly different , why do n't you read greek mythology instead of watching this
having taught the book for some years and having admired branagh 's talents as well , i was excited to see what he did with the book . his acting talents are remarkable , again ; the sets are exceptional ; the liberties taken deplorable . he ruined it . killing elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable . the end of justine is pointless . deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster . minimal script that truncates and eviscerates . horribly disappointed , especially by the maudlin sentimental ending ... bathos supreme . frankly , disgusted . kenneth , what are you doing
reagan began his acting career reading cue-cards in the service of general electric during his stint at the `` ge playhouse . '' reagan 's move to the white house had him doing much the same , reading cue-cards written for him by big business , including ge , a weapons and energy conglomerate that owns nbc . if people want to get a good feel for the reagan administration , i 'd recommend the books of michael parenti , who documents the legacy of dirty wars in latin america and the global class war that is turning our planet into a dystopia of haves and have-nots . globalized `` reaganomics '' ( aka , neoliberalism ) is creating a planet of slums and prisons , war and ecocide . the parts of government that served the general public are being shredded , while the entitlement programs of war profiteers and various robber barrons create record profits . it 's interesting to see the reverence kim jong reagan receives ; but whether people like him or not is immaterial , he was n't in charge of the country . rather , very rich and powerful corporate executives and an army of lawyers and lobbyists entrenched themselves during the reagan administration . this corporate coup is something that many presidents have warned us about , including president martin van buren who said , `` i am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion - the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government - would be exposed by any further increase in the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities . '' if people can break-away from the reagan illusion , and want to learn about real power in this country , i 'd recommend the dvd `` the corporation , '' and the books and radio show of thom hartmann .
talk about a typically clueless american . i threw this book away after reading about half in exasperation
<NUM> `` alien '' by director ridley scott and <NUM> `` aliens '' by director james cameron , are the only movies of this success fox franchise , that really were extraordinary films . `` alien '' is consider one of the most extraordinary horror movies of all times , mean while `` aliens '' is considered one of the best sci-fi movies of all times . sadly for the saga , the people of fox did a very bad job hiring david fincher to direct `` alien <NUM> '' and the french guy jean-pierre jeunet who direct `` aliens resurrection ''
this is the first book i 've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting , but because i could n't wait to be done with it . it reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or , perhaps , for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city . the themes , problems and experiences of the stassos family are so completely generic that , should the book be interpreted into any visual form , it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made ! and as for the `` poetic '' prose that is attributed to this novel : the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious . many experiences are not simply stated , but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning . one example that i underlined : `` ' i 'm always careful , ' ben said , in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom , a pomegranate -- into a crater . '' what ? ! ! ! granted , the context is missing , but even in the context , this quote made me laugh . and by the time i came to the last third of book , the laughter was all that got me though to the end ( that , and the fact that i had to finish it because i told someone that i would . ) if i could give this book less than one star , i would .
p.u.n.k.s . is a very bad movie even for a disney channel movie . a boy is feeling neglected after his dad dose n't make it to his party and then finds his father is making a suit that is a robotic suit for a evil boss that walks with a crow on his shoulder . this is by far the worst movie of the 1990s next to titanic . this movie is only for kids and idiots because this movie is awful . even randy quaid and henry winkler were embarrassed to be in this mess . if you want a good disney channel movie watch the paper brigade . the only good part was the credits
the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting . an effort to watch . make-up , dyed hair , costumes poorly done . one man 's eyebrows , the suitor 's , are altered like a woman 's ! no scenery or homes of interest , except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor . not a pleasant pace , without humor , without intrigue . a lesbian undertone in one scene . the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen , quoted . fanny sums up in one sentence , why she will not marry him . women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty , will wish to sum up their certainty with ms. austen 's line : `` his sole interest is in being loved , not in loving '' . this line is an exception to a lifeless script . there , now you do not need to endure the painful movie . here are two lines re-written by me : for the woman dealing with a trifling man : `` no man suffers pains of love on the stage . '' for dealing with the infatuated man : `` you have wounded yourself , but not with love . '' this movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen . there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film , humorous , with singing , with interest . a movie can take the best of the book , in the spirit of the book , which this movie did not carry , and make a movie better than the book . this movie is bad any which way . well-made period romance films are : `` pride & prejudice <NUM> , <NUM> , & <NUM> '' , `` wives & daughters '' , `` north & south '' . fairly made is `` under the greenwood tree '' . i rated `` persuasion '' at 2-stars for the wooden acting ; however `` persuasion '' is 5-stars compared to this `` mansfield park '' . `` persuasion '' has attractive scenery , costumes , beautiful singing , and an uplifting plot ; though of interest only to women , preferably who have already read the book .
high record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned . blur became household names in britain because of this album , especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle `` parklife '' , but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band : it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer damon albarn 's mental breakdown . but what did they expect ? this is , after all , the album that summed up britain 's geezer culture : where men are men and women act like men as well . where the thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away , and it 's okay to look after number <NUM> and act like a bit or a moron . this album , for better or worse ( in my opinion , worse ) is more representative of britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else . if you 're american and still think that britain is all hugh grants and tea on the village green , forget it . and here 's the proof . the album itself is cheerful enough , but totally uninspired . it bears none of the influence from american acts of the 80s and 90s , like nirvana , sonic youth , the meat puppets or dinosaur jr. , or brit acts like my bloody valentine . guitarist graham coxon 's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs , because they 're written by albarn . just tunes , many of which are distinctly ordinary . even much-lauded songs like `` this is a low '' are let-downs , because they do n't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the beatles or the kinks . indeed , blur are just like a modern kinks . just without the great songs . it 's sad that with this album , blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said . modern life is rubbish
not all sections are included . only one or two solutions per section . very rarely they 'll have an extra sentence or so of explanation , but that 's about it
when bob clark gave us the original back in the <NUM> and threw a young margot kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.as a result it worked for the most part.oh before i forget , rest in peace bob clark.he died at <NUM> in a head on which also killed his son last week.this version directed by glen morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.hey there 's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through andrea martin head.its laughable ! she would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.the acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.they 're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.you 'll probably do what i did after a while and root for the killer
dont buy this book ! or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long . wow i mean talk about boreing . is it the best of times or is it the worst of times ? you cant make up you 're mind on page one sentence one even ! ? ! if i am this guys editer i would have told him to just write about the best of times . thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow . only one star for you but keep trying youll get there

if you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking . if you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again ! this video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing `` club '' clothing instead of spandex . i was very disappointed with this purchase
what a waste of time , money , and talent . if its murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill . sorry i wasted my time viewing such trash
elaine feinstein obviously did n't have access to many sources for this very poor biography . sylvia plath certainly cast a huge shadow over hughes ' life , but we get very little insight into the hughes-plath marriage from hughes ' perspective . feinstein does n't know how to write biography -- a difficult art form for anyone who is n't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism . feinstein did n't want to annoy anyone with her lame book . dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which i wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript , and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of hughes in a thorough , responsible fashion . do n't waste your money on this book . check it out of the library if you must , but do n't buy it
cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today . they have such great stage charisma , top notch talent , and they consistently get better with age ! what other band sounds better <NUM> years later ? after my disappointment with the special one cd , i was excited to hear about this dvd ; i heard most special one songs live , and could n't understand why they translated to tape poorly . having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out . and the songs do sound much better now , such tremendous intensity robin has live , the guitars and bass sound great , and there 's a great build up to the climax of each song . however , what 's really the downer about this dvd is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track , you then get 2/3 of each live song . not a single song appears here in its entirety . it 's like a behind the music ( without drama or drugs ) based around a new live show . the banter is great , but this clip-show format kills the replay value of this disc . the closest comparison i can give is the 2-dvd version of silver , how the second dvd has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs . that 's exactly what this is like , however , you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show . bonus features are fun , with the band and their families visiting japan , although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety . perhaps someday we 'll get the budakan show on dvd or an updated every trick in the book dvd . update 6/14/05 : exactly a year later , i 've still yet to pop this into my dvd player for a second watch , and cheap trick 's still my favorite band .
i completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel `` overkill '' with regards to the puppy mill preaching . those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry . this choir member did not appreciate being preached at for <NUM> pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development . also , i got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and akc show terms and slang . again , those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what udx , cdx and ofa stand for . readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what bob stands for , what `` finishing '' a dog means , or what an open class is would probably take the time to find out . i would have preferred a patrick o'brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang . just throw 'em out there for those of us who know , and pique the interest of those that do n't . the way it turned out , however , is that one hundred and fifty pages of a <NUM> page novel were all either dog show terms explained , or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry . i am a bit amazed that ms. conant does not say anything at all about the average `` backyard breeder '' who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers , who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills , if not more . go figure . i have two other susan conant dog lover 's mysteries to read , and after this first , i am a little leery of even opening the covers
save your money and leave this book on the shelf . this guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear . moreover , most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling , peterson 's & quot ; summer opportunities for kids and teenagers & quot ;
i had n't seen all of these episodes when they aired -- nor all of seasons <NUM> or <NUM> , as my interest/obsession waned after the crew went to college -- so it was worth it to me to be able to view them all in full . however , they are n't very good and i very much doubt that i will watch them again and again over time the way i might the first <NUM> seasons . the final two-part episode is an exception but if one wanted , one could buy that episode alone on dvd . the creators took the helm back for the series finale and it focuses on our original 4-5 characters ( <NUM> if you include jack ) , leaving out audrey and others , which i for one very much appreciated . although to me they already had enough of an acceptable reason and to reunite everyone in capeside ( five years in the future ) and enough material w/which to surprise us ( and tie up some loose ends ) all in a nice melodramatic/comedic fashion without * killing another character off * . ( after both abbey and mitch met accidental deaths in earlier seasons , i feel like it gets to be a bit much -- but at least this time , there 's a believable -- although rarely occurring -- medical cause . ) at least joey ended up with the right guy ( in my not-so-humble opinion ) . basically , if you 're a committed dawson 's ( err , joey 's ; - ) creek fan and want to collect the whole set , you 'll want to purchase this season . otherwise , though , you might consider skipping it and maybe buying the series finale separately . also , special features were sorely lacking . this set marked the end of one of the wb 's most successful shows that launched acting careers for several young people ; the least they could have done is include behind-the-scenes interviews with cast/crew ! creator commentary on the last episode just does n't cut it
of all the terrific betty grable films i do n't understand how this one made it to dvd . i just thought the story was dull and the dvd quality was n't the greatest . i wish they would put i wake up screaming , the dolly sisters and mother wore tights on dvd
that is the bottom line for this author . she spends way too much time telling us to `` embrace '' our new , thick waistlines , and too little time on any real information or help . do n't bother exercising . just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place , get <NUM> hours of sleep every night ( good luck with that ! ) and eliminate all stress from your life . that 's all you have to do , and then you 'll only gain <NUM> pounds during menopause instead of <NUM> or <NUM> . save your money
after seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book i was eager to buy it for my recent trip to mexico city . sadly , it fell far short of my expectations . for starters , the maps are woefully inadequate . there are n't enough of them , they lack sufficient detail , and there is no number and letter grid system . that last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book . the overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical . making matters worse , the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended . i have had far better books than this when i have visited other parts of the world . i have to think someone makes a better mexico city guide too
i had high hopes for requiem of darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it . also , the characters looked very unique and intriguing . unfortunatley , the beginning is very rough , both in content and speed of the show . the plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories . he is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head . he meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers , and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy . unfortunately , the show is not as slick as the plot sounds . the first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling . it is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous . throughout the episode , you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises . the problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who 's who . the second episode i found more enjoyable since it was unique . it is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman . the willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children . it even has a little plot twist , nothing extrodinary but still welcoming . and once again , the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders . this is when the show became boring for me . i do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about , but i like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about . also , the show 's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the dvd . i give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great . unfortunately , the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show were n't the main focus of these first few episodes . maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot , but i personally do n't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk . one last note : this show has very intense adult content . do n't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not . actually , i personally thought the rating was too low for this show
dull and inane come to mind . consists mostly of peabody 's artificially `` catty '' - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets ( even the cat ) , fuzzy descriptions of egyptian `` archaeology '' ( ... ) . the plot is slow moving , clich√© and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts . i found more of pennance than pleasure in this read . avoid it
dont buy it from amazon ! i got burned , i bought what was supposed to be the new delux edition and what i received was the original cd release . i 'd rather buy items like this from official stores instead of amazon after that hell of an experience . over-all , its a great albu
i was very disappointed in cd . way to hillbilly for me
someone here says `` alot of indie snobs love deerhoof '' . that 's correct , and that pretty much speaks volumes . here 's another band with hip vintage equipment , boring song structures , alot of connections , and nothing to say . as if there were n't enough of these bands out there . absolutely nothing of consequence is going on here : it basically boils down to a phenomenal waste of human and natural resources to make this band 's cds and release them to their <NUM> or so fans ( mostly indie rock cd store clerks ) . it is also a waste of your time , and mine , giving them another moment of thought . extra points docked for the worst band name ever
so the creators of this show paid a lot of money to various record companies to feature songs on the tv show soundtrack and hardly if ever used new music that they themselves would compose or not . it is really product placement of the worst kind . be lazy and let other recording artists do the work for you , considering that this stupid show was made the way it was , it was not surpiseing that they reverted to this just to save money
although it kills me to write anything less than glowing about edwin mccain ( i think he 's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we 've seen in the last ten years ) , i just can not get into this album . like others have said , i too have every edwin album and have seen him in concert . i love everything he 's ever done .... but this album just does n't do it for me . and i know people will say ... `` give the album a chance '' ..... or ... `` let edwin grow and move in new musical directions '' . but ..... i 've listened to this album at least <NUM> times all the way through and it 's just not growing on me . it feels `` flat '' and just does n't feel edwin-ish ( if that makes any sense ) . even grammercy park hotel , which i saw him debut live and which is on his live dvd does n't feel the same on here .... just does n't have the feeling or soul . i would pick up austin sessions over this album any day . that is edwin doing what he does best . maybe he feels the pressure to write some `` hits '' so that he does n't have to spend two solid years on the road in the black pearl ( his tour bus ) ..... and who could blame him ? ? ? but this feels like he 's trying too hard . i soooooo hope he comes back with a better album next time , so i can rave about it , because although i gave this album <NUM> stars .... edwin , as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves <NUM> ! ! ! ! ! !
being an avid simon kenton fan , i was really looking forward to this book but found it quite boring . i suppose after reading allan eckert 's `` frontiersman '' , any accounting of the life of simon kenton pales in comparison
every soundtrack sounds like the previous one because of slow , ponderous , heavy , sterile , dry interpretation of the themes . one just expects some brightness in the playing but this is never delivered . this recording & quot ; tries & quot ; to have a story . stick to the original soundtrack . <NUM> times more enjoyable
oh my , what a voice , she really gets on one 's nerves . in way too much a hurry with all that she is `` trying '' to achieve . i could not get past the first couple of minutes of her whinny directions . do yourself a favor and pass this one by
first off let me start off by saying that i am a very big fan of edwin mccain , his band , and his music . i bought this dvd thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing , but was only left with my pocket 's empty , and my hopes shattered . edwin mccains personality is portrayed here , as all other reviewers have said , but that really is all that this dvd does well . with only about <NUM> minutes of live music i , as a viewer was left asking myself why edwin and atc records decided to put this disc out . the only notable music on this dvd is `` i 'll be '' . this is very easily edwin 's lowest quality item put out , lacking the passion , and originiality that so many of us know him by . a noteworthy story , if not the only one is the story of how he wrote i 'll be , and the only reason that it is noteworthy , is not because it is a great story , but rather i 'll be is a great track . so if you have money to spare , and time to waste then you can buy this dvd , but unless edwin releases a new dvd i suggest , that you stick to his cd 's
... or the other reviews . those reviews probably came from someone in their camp . when i first saw these two , i said `` no they did not ! '' if you go to a music store it n the rap section and look through it , you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers . these guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of mobb deep . these two clowns are nothing more than sucker mc 's trying to get a dollar off of someone else 's hard earned names . if you are new to hip-hop or just young , there is a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker mc ( a fake rapper , someone without skills , someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping ) and these clowns are it
nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers i have ever heard . i do give him props on his first album , but he went downhill and started that whole `` i can make great club beats , but write bubblegum lyrics over it '' trend . this sadly created all the chingys , lil johns and so on . the guy does n't add any substance to his music , yet he sells millions thanks to mtv . just save your money on real artist that makes real music
mr hibbert writes in a very dull , dry tone and i found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story . he confuses the reader with time , people and his interpretation of what elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen . i only read this because i had to ( for school ) . if you do n't have to read it , then do n't ! it will bore you to death
layout of book is really bland and examples are scant . the subject matter is interesting , but the book itself is dry- you can almost hear ben stein narrating when you read it .
the cast is great ! not sure how they got the stars to do this movie the story line about an aging robin hood and maid marian as a nun just does n't do well . filming is below standard and dialogue is weak . save your mone
most people considered this the cheap trick & quot ; comeback & quot ; album . sixteen years after the fact i 'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a & quot ; go-back & quot ; album instead . while cheap trick did n't set the music world on fire with most of their <NUM> 's releases , it was n't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release & quot ; the doctor & quot ; that i actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums . on & quot ; the doctor & quot ; i searched but came up empty . & quot ; lap of luxury & quot ; is n't quite that bad , but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow . i 've made dozens of cheap trick compilations over the years and & quot ; let go & quot ; was the only song that i included off of lol . the thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the trick back to their rockin ' roots . well let me tell ya , this is far from it . i know . i remember
i think it is very admirable that marsalis has attempted to produce a classical cd , however , this is not the sublime , masterpiece that so many previous reviewers have labelled it . his tone is particularly unstable , and not very even , his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however . this is a real shame , as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto , anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first . his tuning is barely acceptable , but only for a jazzo , he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher . please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone , played by a real player , such as bornkamp , rousseau , delangle , fourmeau , michat , londeix , etc . this is a good introduction to classical music , if for the first time , but please do n't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music , and of saxophone
in a nutshell , the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to anyone 's intelligence that i 'm surprised it got published at all . a lawyer wrote this garbage , huh ? i wonder where he graduated from . perhaps he obtained his 'degree ' from the same place scott peterson got the <NUM> fake ones hanging on his wall ? unbelievable ! did this 'author ' , and i use this term loosely , ever do any real research on this case ? this dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix . must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance . a total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well . for those who care about laci peterson and the truth of her murder read sharon rocha 's book , `` for laci '' as well as catherine crier 's book , `` a deadly game '' . also , do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain . if i could find information on this case myself , a lowly civilian , then surely dalton could have . i just do n't think he wanted to , frankly . i believe i could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome ! skip this book unless you truly do n't think scott peterson killed his wife and son .
this movie was extreamly stupid , but very funny . we just laughed though this hole movie . this was pretty much very soft porn . the hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them . the special effects sucked , they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes ( the black and white ones ! ! ) . the acting was very bad , and this movie is very anticrist
unfortunately i did n't read the reviews below before i bought this dvd . it 's a travesty of the dvd medium . perhaps fox lorber took the story of the movie too seriously : they 've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy . do n't waste your money on it
* * 1/2 if `` north country '' did n't say that it was set in <NUM> , you 'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters , which can only be classified as `` neanderthal '' ( though that might be an insult to neanderthals ) . and , indeed , you would be right not to believe it , for the events on which the film is based actually began in <NUM> , a full decade and a half before the time of the movie . the drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the clarence thomas senate hearings of <NUM> - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie . it 's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that does n't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie . with charlize theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama , `` north country '' tells the true but highly fictionalized story of lois jensen ( here referred to as josie aimes ) , a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern minnesota steel mine , only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment . here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make henry higgins look like alan alda in comparison . when she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there , aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant , the unenlightened townsfolk , or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs . eventually , she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine ( in <NUM> , actually , a full three years before the clarence thomas/anita hill spectacle ) , resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country . there is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one , but `` north country '' feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world ( yes , i realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be , but that still doesn ` t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie ) . moreover , `` north country '' ca n't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues . as a result , the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme , with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero , villain and victim molds with very little shading in between . despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story , the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing does n't have the look and feel of a lifetime original movie , just with higher priced stars in its cast ( frances mcdormand , woody harrelson , sissy spacek , and richard jenkins , the dead father from `` six feet under '' ) . and while the acting is decent , the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters . perhaps it 's just that after movies like `` norma rae , '' `` silkwood , '' and `` erin brockovich , '' which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised , `` north country '' comes up a day late and a dollar short in the i-am-woman-hear-me-roar department .
it is alright to present an alternative point of view , but it is not right to attack other recovery programs , especially those with a proven track record . i suspect mr. trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-step programs.the truth is that one size does not fit all . some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others . read this book and try this method . if it does not work try another one . they are all good in their own way . but mr. trimpey : if one person , who can not be helped by your method , ignores other options because of your attack on aa , you should be ashamed of yourself
this movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity , believability , and budget . and can we say ... just squish the leeches already . not worth your time
if you 're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review . that said , this dts disc sounds terrible . why ? 1- if you 're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs , you will hardly recognize them here . the multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix ; in other words , they sound totally different from each other . 2- this disc does n't have the fidelity of the sony re-mastered abraxas . the tape hiss is very noticeable , and the overall sound is very dull . just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley . save your money and `` maybe '' someday sony will release a multi-channel sacd from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd
apparantly my first review was censored by amazon , so here goes again . this movie is , by far , the worst film i 've ever tried to watch . i say 'tried ' because after two separate attempts i couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film . this is coming from someone who gave eraserhead <NUM> stars , so take this as a very bad sign . long story short , andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant , flaky , artsy stuff . for example , imagine the most self-important art major you 've ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten . or anything completely nonsensical such as that , that is the level of conversation these men have in this film . i watched this movie because it was compared to a scene in linklater 's waking life ( which was intelligent and thought-provoking ) . if you pay the absurd amount of money they are asking for this dvd , there is something wrong with you
this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in <NUM> ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .
i love the band but the audio quality was miserable . it sounded like it was recorded from the back of the hall with a hand held low-end camcorder . maybe i got a defective copy ?
with great music and a setting that reminds you of `` vampire hunter d '' it sucks you into watching the series . the plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing . the animation is good , which is a must have for me , but it was n't enough to redeem the series
i purchased eldredge 's `` wild at heart '' , and i did n't think it was scripturally sound . i was given `` waking the dead '' as a present , so i tried to read it as well . i finally gave it up . john eldredge 's writing is typical of today 's movement to bring the world into the church . trying to show a young christian the religious aspects of movies like `` the matrix '' may work , but to my <NUM> year old ears it rings very hollow . perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute christ 's message to get people to listen . for better or worse , i have little patience for it . the author also presents the image of god as `` my friend '' . to me this is nothing but another watering down of the gospel message to get the world to accept it . giving the creator human attributes brings him down to a level where we can work things out between us . i ca n't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate bible translation . after all , my friend would n't let my saintly mother die , and save a worthless drug addict now would he ? god my friend probably would n't have sent his son to die for my worthless self anyway . this is exactly the same theology as building the largest `` christian '' church in the united states , and not putting any crosses in it so as not to `` offend anyone '' . it 's the same as getting on a nationally televised program , and stuttering about whether you believe those who do n't accept christ are doomed to hell . when you profess to be a christian minister or author and you ca n't speak correctly of what christianity teaches , it 's time to examine just what you really believe . god 's word is not always easy to swallow . either it 's the truth or it is n't . mr. eldredge also speaks often of `` setting hearts free '' . while i do believe hearts are free when released from sin , a christian is bought and paid for with christ 's blood and not `` free '' at all . titus <NUM> ( kj ) begins , `` paul , a servant of god , and an apostle of jesus christ '' ... christians are freed , but to begin a life of service . for a more accurate and fulfilling study , i recommend `` the way of the master '' books and videos by ray comfort/kirk cameron .
clarity of cd and dvd not good compared to `` caught in the act
this sounds like an ideal book for a person with an eating disorder . but it heaps loads of guilt and condemnation on an already needy and suffering soul . the idea that over or undereating is sin is one concept . but the fact is that the individuals embroiled in this can not help themselves . they are already people pleasers and perfectionists , how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help ? they are already as good as they can get themselves to be . they are not bad -- they are hurt and afraid . it has been said no one can overcome an eating disorder without the help of a therapist . this i believe . there are too many important issues involved in this disease to dismiss it as sin . if the person knew the issues they would be a long way to getting help . god loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain . these are very good people . heaping more condemnation on one beset with self-loathing is surely not the path to freedom . adding god 's displeasure to this already mountainous pile of self hate can only be damaging -- perhaps pushing some over the edge . a good book to avoid ! !
the last song in it was not written by rodgers and hart . it was i think written by roger edens ( of judy garland fame ? ) , and is a mediocre imitation of hartesque rhymes , at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start . several of the songs from the stage show were left out , as were all the verses . extra lyrics ( not by hart ) were added to `` the most beautiful girl in the world '' for durante to sing and martha 's raye 's `` the circus is on parade . '' songs from other r & h shows were interpolated . did someone high up like god know better than r & h what songs should be in a r & h show ? finally , and absolutely humiliating for martha raye and i suspect doris day had a hand in it but maybe not , the line sung by doris `` two feet are ever cold '' is followed by martha raye with `` four feet are never cold '' which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered `` i only mean to imply '' by raye . goodness . she said something wrong . i am beginning to dislike doris day intensely . she disgusts me . the title of this shocking little song is `` why ca n't i ? '' also not from the original show and with much excised . the story ( such as it is ) is a predictable drag . the dvd is cheap on amazon ( until you add postage ) , it 's a flat $ <NUM> everywhere else + tax . if you must , buy it from amazon . i would n't take it for free . this is truly wholesome family entertainment , and that 's about as nauseous a recommendation as i can give it . if you like rodgers and hart , forget it . durante was in the original on stage . i gave it <NUM> stars for the pretty tunes ( and almost roger edens ' ) .
although i agree with much of what ms . seaman writes about synthetic estrogen , ( made from mares ' urine , ) and progestin , ( synthetic progesterone ) , i strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially `` dangerous '' to the female body . ( pls . see dr. uzzi reiss 's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book , natural hormone balance for women , in which he , ( dr. reiss ) , states : `` currently estrogen is `` under attack '' as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer . i find this ludicrous . estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women 's unique gender . after <NUM> million yrs . of human evolution , could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer ? would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species ? of course not . incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer . '' ( p. <NUM> of dr. reiss 's book ) . i thoroughly agree with dr. reiss . i , ( along with something like <NUM> % of women in menopause ) , had terrible symptoms of insomnia , lack of energy , lethargic depression , muscle/joint pain , and minor anxiety . it took me two yrs . of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen , and i consider it a `` lifesaver . '' it has literally given me back my sense of who i was before menopause . within 1-1/2 hrs . of taking the hormone , i became in control of my mind and mood again , regained my stamina , slept better than i had in <NUM> yrs. , and within a few days started to lose the excess wt . i had gained . my recommendation is that in addition to ms . seaman 's book , readers might like to read dr. reiss 's book , ( from a purely clinician point-of-view , ) , rather than just a political one . hooray for tri-est ! ! ( name of the bio-identical estrogen formula i used ) .
it took me less than a day and a half to read this book . and thats not because i was `` glued to it '' or `` thought it was a real page-turner '' but basically because it was a real fast read . however , this book , as i stated , is a perfect example of stephen king 's boredom with writing horror/fiction . his work within the last decade especially , has taken some well deserved criticism . based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a `` cookie-cutter '' method . now , do n't get me wrong , king is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever . stories that seem to transcend the `` horror genre '' , and incorporate elements of mystery , romance , and drama . however , this is not one . i would rate this book only behind `` insomnia '' as the most insipid king novels i 've ever read . i do n't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of king 's work . but for those who have , it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book , i found myself thinking `` oh .... it 's going to be another one of these stories huh ? '' these meaning a really generic character , and a foreseeable `` generic '' villian , ultimately squaring off in a very `` generic '' ending . halfway through , i could already see how it was going to end . and this is one of those books where king 's references to east coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product . some examples of king 's finest work would be `` the talisman '' , `` night shift '' ( the best collection of short horror stories ever ) , the shining , the `` dark tower '' sieries , and the stand , just to name a few . and if you have not read any of `` the bachman books '' ( king as bachman ) `` rage '' , `` the long walk '' , road work '' , and `` the running man '' , are some of the most well written , and mind-bending stories ever told . this , however , is n't . and unless you can purchase this book for under $ 2.00 do n't waste your money , or your time .
just who wants to hear van morrison complain like an old ninny about the press , or the pitfalls of being a godlike , mythical celebrity trapped by his own legend and fame -- and all of it contained in bland rocking-chair muzak jazz . three chords and some bad lyrics and right away they come on with a messiah complex . ( you fans and your empty lives are partly to blame for all this . ) `` i just want to sing my songs , '' he whines . ( who 's stopping you ? ) john waters once said : if you want to be left alone , pick up a monkey wrench and fix toilets and stay out of show business . besides , i did n't know van the man was all that famous . does anyone under <NUM> know who he is ? i sure have n't seen any articles in the paper about him lately . old hippies might still babble about `` into the mystic '' and his performance in `` the last waltz . '' i heard him sing `` gloria '' on an oldies station the other day and i went straight for rush limbaugh . are the royals in england so desexed these days that the daily sun has to write up van morrison to this degree of musical paranoia ?
i used to like rob zombie , up until hellbilly delux . everything after that is garbage . this album is no exception . every song sounds the same and is very predictable . the lyrics are nonsensical , educated horses ? he says that phrase in like <NUM> or <NUM> songs on this cd , i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd 's together to scrap in some extra money . he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented . i do n't recommend this cd to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his cd's/merchandise regardless . <NUM> star , i went through this cd in less than <NUM> minutes , very disappointed , and will never put it back into a cd-player again
nice package .... attractive and it has almost all of the tracks by this minor group that you would want , but they took the gnp crescendo album master tapes ... complete with tons of horrible-sounding rechanneled tracks and grungy , distorted stereo . the sound is no better than the old gnp cds that have been around for years .... which were 10th generation copies of the masters for the vinyl lps . finally , the track are in no particular order and there 's no information about each track fits into the seeds body of music . it 's apparent that the guy who prepared this collection ( pat gilbert ) knows nothing about the era and is defintively not the guy to have done this reissue
as mentioned in another review , stolen scenes from runaway train . not just clips , but entire scenes . also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger . still worth $ <NUM> - $ <NUM> for a dvd just for the other action
i belive that the author of this book is blaming society , especially universities , a little too much . in the beginning when he makes this assertion that universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation that since there a few african americans in the universities that they are racist or something like that . furthmore since the military has more african americans it is a better instiution . here is a better explanation . universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire population . the army will take anyone it can get its hands on . i just did not like the authors atitutde that the whole is racist . furthermore he knows nothing about music . i love when he writes white soldiers are listening to more black music and he uses heavy metal and rock n roll , both white music ! in fact heavy metal is white protest music against black music ! do some research or think before writting a book
this production is okay -- not a complete waste of time , but not great either . overall , the script is a very shallow translation of the book , particularly regarding jane fairfax and frank churchill . though ewan mcgregor is pretty forgettable as frank churchill ( partly because of the script ) , and toni collette seems to be less harriet smith and more forrest gump at some points , there are still some excellent performances . gwyneth paltrow does well with the material ( such as it is ) , and she works well with jeremy northam ( mr. knightly ) . i especially enjoyed juliet stevenson as mrs. elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of phyllida law and sophie thompson as mrs. and miss bates . overall , this production looks pretty , but it 's austen for the masses . people who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and are n't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it . for the rest of us , i recommend the production of emma staring kate beckinsdale .
this never should 've been pressed . they should 've taken the mix and thrown it out . do not buy ! !
i am a huge fan of enigma and have all four of their previous albums , which are absolutely excellent . this is why i was so disappointed with this one . it is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up . the entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying , harsh , distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears . it seems to me that in this music michael cretu has become a modern-day german full of angst and self pity that no one could care less about . boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album
classical music is beautiful and rewarding . ca n't it be rewarding on its own terms , rather than as a & quot ; fast track & quot ; to the ivy league and financial success ? when i was a child , my parents played classical music for us because they loved it , and they hoped we would , too . i do the same for my own kids . but my siblings did n't much like classical music , and despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this cd , their sat scores were in line with my own . i think that if beethoven or mozart knew that their beautiful , timeless music was being cheapened into just another & quot ; get ahead quick & quot ; scam , they 'd roll over in their graves
i have been a huge fan of dean koontz for years , ever since my mom got me to read watchers . but this story is just way too slow . just when i thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride .... it would slow way down again . i almost put it down halfway through the book , but i kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner . about 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining .... but i just felt like something was missing most of the time i was reading . i just could n't get into the characters . i would n't recommend this book to any first time dean koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off .... do n't judge his work by this novel .
about as instructive as a sex ed tape from high school . do not recommend
we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch . can anyone say buzz and woody ? chicken run ? the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies -- almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story <NUM> . how many times can you do the a-bomb joke ... worse still is the dialogue , the painfully unfunny one-liners , and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions . it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another , and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest . there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest . this film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry .
nancy helps mr. drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building . the owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck . ooooooh ! that 's so scary . yawwwwwwn . this book is absolutely horrible . the writing is terrible , the action is missing and there really is n't any mystery . it 's not like nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals . when you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people . lots of suspense there . this book features nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants . this is an awful book that does n't even deserve a <NUM> star rating
the author talks about all major developments in the field of quantum physics as of the date the book was published , but does not explain them clearly , especially towards the end with topics such as super gravity . the diagrams appear out of sync with the text , and are not explained well . i somewhat liked the book in the begining , but at the end was forcing myself to finish it
why american production make hk movies look so cheap ? first of all , they cut off so much scene , second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by english dubb . for any of hk movies , always stick with original licensed hk release . be careful with cheap imports , boots though
this is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy , pre-packaged beliefs . sure , this series bears some [ contrived ] humor ; how convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism . do n't get me wrong , i 'm not some regressive conservative who , with a red face , watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur michael moore because of his fabricated `` misrepresentations and untruths . '' i guess i 'm writing this because i had the misfortune of seeing `` the awful truth , '' and i feel i need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until i have an aneurysm . ( if i had an aneurysm , i 'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the shamu tank at sea world . at least i could warp some kids ' minds in the process of dying . ) every episode is literally like , `` awful fact of the day : some obscure , skewed study shows that americans are dumb and like explosions and i 'm michael moore an attention-starved clownboat ! '' seriously , it 's interesting moore critiques `` american indulgence '' when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright . - thus says the pellingto
this is not a book for believers . anyone of the jewish , christian or muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended . mr. kirsh takes several biblical passages out of context to use in his argument . his attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly religious and believes strongly in the words of the bible is extreemly condeceding . he says & quot ; if you read the bible with open eyes and an open mind & quot ; . therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his way is narrow minded . it was not until i got trough the first <NUM> or so pages did i realise that none of the & quot ; rave reviews & quot ; he received were from any clergy or religious orders . further i realised that mr. kirsch views are not stated out in the open . you do n't see his perjorative view towards the bible , moses and god until after you 've got into reading the book . i would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are contemptuous of the bible and the above faiths
i bought this cd thinking that the songs , production , harmonies , or something would have been along the same lines as the ballroom considering curt boettcher 's involvment ..... wrong ! in my opinion mrs. blue bird is the only worthwhile song on this disc , and it itself is only a marginal song , sorry . i was hoping they were n't going to be some rip off of the sunshine company . they 're not at all , but maybe should have been . i guess i was hoping for something that rocked a little bit , or had some killer harmonies , or some off the wall arrangements , or was at least up-tempo sometimes . again , in my opinion , besides blue bird , the songs are very draggy and slow . i 've tried , i 've listened to the disc serveral times to give it a change to grow on me . not going to happen . my apologies .
i wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun . instead , i found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people . most infuriating was the character of tony , possibly the most arrogant , pompous , self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature . and the author condones him and his behavior ! he 's right , do n't you see ? he 's a macho guy , the omni present voice of reason and knowing what 's right for everyone . the other infuriating part of this novel is the author 's treatment of faye , the heroine . because she 's & quot ; fiesty , independent and outspoken & quot ; , she is repeatedly referred to as & quot ; difficult to handle & quot ; and & quot ; a real handful & quot ; . excuse me , but is ms. moore saying that women need to be & quot ; handled & quot ; ? apparently so , since we 're told that faye has really & quot ; met her match & quot ; in this tony loser . i think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter , aggressive and accomplished . why the author has strong-willed faye succumb to tony 's blackmail and bullying is way beyond me . and the way the novel ended ? come on ! she has made the smart , strong willed man the hero ( though she tries to discuss his & quot ; faults & quot ; to make things appear even ) , and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is ... and trying ever so hard to change . if any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day , i 'm pretty sure she 'd tell him to shove it far , far up where the sun do n't shine - and i ca n't believe that faye did n't . a novel for the 21st century ? i do n't think so . if you love chick-lit , read the shopaholic books or the nanny diaries ; at least they 're well written and funny
the 1st `` movie '' : fist of fear , touch of death is so bad i did n't even watch the next <NUM> . the uninitiated will possibly not know that the footage that purports to be about bruce 's life , family and ancestry is all rubbish and was actually taken from <NUM> different movies : the ancestors `` cuts '' in color are from a colossally poor period piece that would be funny if it did n't seem to be taking itself seriously . while the black and white parents-and-family `` cuts '' actually are truly a young bruce in a hong kong film that he made before returning to the u.s. to live . however the scenario is totally misrepresented . all of the other participants are actors as well and not correctly identified . nor is the dubbed dialog related to what is really being spoken ( in cantonese ) by the actors . yet a third source is tapped for the `` supposed interviews '' which are not with the speaker at all , but with someone else regarding the work bruce did on the `` longstreet '' tv show in '71 and once again the voice-over not only is not really bruce and is again , not accurate ( and he was speaking english during those interviews ) . one would be better served to buy the `` legend '' dvd from the -bruce lee master collection- or the more recent `` bruce lee : the warrior 's journey '' to see and hear in bruce 's own words and voice what the non- '' what 's up tiger-lily '' version is of the early hong kong ( black and white ) and what the `` longstreet '' interviews have to reveal about him . if this is meant to be a spoof and they just forgot to mention that anywhere , then shame on them . i do n't find it even remotely humorous , not to consider the generations of people who might not know any better since his untimely death <NUM> years ago .
who wrote this movie ? that is the first thing i had to ask myself after watching this movie a couple of months ago . oddly enough , this movie was one of my favorite `` scary '' films to watch as a little boy ... but , as an adult , wow ... this is just bad . the original jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second , although not as deep or well paced , is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline . this movie , on the other hand , is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover ... at sea world ! who would ever think to incorporate sea world into the jaws franchise ? ? ? seriously , it was just a horrible idea ! the whole , `` mother shark lost her baby shark '' scenario is just weird ... i do n't even think that shark 's raise there `` pups '' once they are born ... they just swim away . not that this is that much different than the plot in jaws <NUM> , where a `` relative '' shark of the first jaws decides to go after cheif brody and his kids ... cheesy , but still , more fun and overall a better storyline . this movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-d graphics add a overly grainy , aged look to the film . the acting is horrendous . dennis quaid is ok , but everyone else is just plain awful . also , who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass ? who ok 'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark 's nose hitting it <NUM> times ? ? ? that 's not too safe in my opinion . this is just a bad , bad movie . there is n't much that i can say is good about it ... but , i will give it <NUM> stars because it entertained me when i was a little boy and for that i am thankful
the reason post soviet republics are struggling right now is because the ineffective oppressive state machinery has entered into a transitory mafia controlled capitalism , because of its communist roots . its not the revenge of history it 's the resultof it ! no poised argument for socialis
after seeing the first series , i thought ( hoped ) that intelligence had started to find it 's way back to humor . with the second series , i see that i was wrong . horribly wrong . in the former , we were introduced to these characters , and with each new scene , a new quirk or tidbit was released to us . in the latter , there is no development at all . it is formulaic . the characters basically do the same thing , again and again , without even much of a change in scenery . messrs. walliams and lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least , which i find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail . perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them . it certainly seems that they have stopped caring . if you like to `` parrot '' characters verbatim , play drinking games by shouting out what 's coming next in a scene , or find that you 've been attracted to saturday night live post <NUM> , you might like this . i was acutely disappointed
if i purchased this book in <NUM> when delphi came up i would be really satisfied . but when you have around & quot ; developers guide & quot ; and & quot ; mastering & quot ; books along with the list of other usefull ones , i consider that buying this book is just waste of your money
i 'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received . if found it severely lacking for a number of reasons : first , it has very few maps , the ones it does have are terrible , and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps . second , it lacks the kind of detail that you 'll find in some other books . finally , the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless . overall , i was extremely disappointed with this book . if you want really good london tavel guides , the rough gude to london and the eyewitness london guide are far , far better
following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do , and more often than not , the album falls well short of expectations , because they 're so highly elevated . `` whip-smart '' is a decent , albeit somewhat inconsistent album , but its pales in comparison to `` exile in guyville '' , and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought . probably the most important thing about `` whip-smart '' is that its not exile part <NUM> , while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from ( `` x-ray man '' , `` crater lake '' ) , the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of exile -- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of `` chopsticks '' to the haunting , moody , `` shane ' , where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant , chugging `` jealousy '' . like exile , it excels when the tension is at its highest , unlike exile , its a lot brighter sounding . still , for all the good stuff on here , it sounds like phair was n't quite ready to issue a followup . several experiments in different veins sound incomplete ( `` alice springs '' ) , fall apart ( `` support system '' , `` go west '' ) or are plain irritating ( `` cinco de mayo '' , `` may queen '' ) . its got its moments , but `` whip-smart '' is largely disposable -- start with phair 's debut , `` exile in guyville '' , its everything its regarded as
note : i bought this cd a while ago , the tunes were mediocre . then again i 'm probably biased because i do n't really like rap a whole lot . buuuut , what made me throw away this album you ask ? the guy is a racist , who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are , and how they 're out to screw him over at every turn . seriously , listen closely , and i counted at least the first <NUM> to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics . i despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down . i do n't care what race you are , do n't be hating on races just because you have a selfish , racist streak in you . in `` jesus walks '' he talks about how we need to defeat racism ... well he keeps harking on it . but he wo n't stop whining . i agree with him , racism does exist and it is a very real problem . however people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it . i should n't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white , or black , or any other race . such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality . additionally , why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon jesus ? the track following `` jesus walks '' he talks about getting falacio ( i 'm trying to be pc , not that it matters ) . i 'm no prude ... most of the music i listen is laden with `` foul language '' . the guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree . he raps about the same stuff . and its not different then most other rappers out there . he 's really not original at all . over and over and over again : look at me i 'm important , feel sorry for me . its like the emo of rap , the linkin park of rap . the guy is a megalomaniac , narcissist , self absorbed racist , and i wo n't be buying anymore of his music . summary : musically its ok , nothing really orignial . just ok if you like rap ( a genre i 'm still trying to get into ) . the guy is talented i 'll give him that . lyrically its a joke . he 's a fake . if that stuff matters to you . but if it dos n't , then ignore this review .... or ignore it because you do n't like my opinion .
considering the massive amount of publicity that this case generated , i could n't imagine that there was anything left for a `` new '' book to present . sadly , there really was n't . this book is chockful of unliklely possibilities being promoted by the defense attorneys and scott 's family . it reeks of denial and desperation .
this has to be one of the worst albums i have ever heard . i got this album for my birthday as i was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music . i have albums of metallica , queens of the stone age , faith no more , nine inch nails , marilyn manson , slayer , korn , slipknot and disturbed that i like , but sepultura 's against is a joke . the first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm . afterwards , it just goes downhill . every song seemed to mimic the next , with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from derrick 'the d ! * $ ' green . sepultura were a much better band with max cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth . all of my friends ( who are metal heads ) agree with me <NUM> % that this is sepultura 's worst album . totally dreadful . after <NUM> minutes of flicking through each song , i had to stop it , take it out and throw it out the window . my advice : avoid
from the people who brought you `` <NUM> first dates '' comes this synthetic remake of the <NUM> burt reynolds-robert aldrich crowdpleaser . instead of a hard-edged prison population , we get caricatures and stereotypes . adam sandler is far more convincing as happy gilmore than paul `` the wrecking '' crewe . though a brilliant stand-up comedian , chris rock has yet to find his cinematic niche . the only bright spots are reynolds ( in the michael conrad role ) and courteney cox
over half of this book consists of material already available in the `` man '' pages on a linux system . the book boasts how it includes many many examples on how to use each command , this is utterly false . there are infact too few examples included . <NUM> % of the material in this book can be found on the internet , on the linux system 's info and man pages . this book will not be friendly for the linux newbie . the title is misleading , `` in a nutshell '' usually means `` the basics of a working system '' . this book is merely acts as reference for the abundance of reference freely available
this cd its just horrible , they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! there are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out

an abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price . the text is awkward . it sounds as if english is not the author 's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship . picasso 's own words , appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated , nor sources given . the reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words . the text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors . walther 's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of picasso 's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings . walther uses words such as & quot ; horror , & quot ; & quot ; grotesque , & quot ; & quot ; misshapen , & quot ; and & quot ; ugly , & quot ; at one point writing , & quot ; picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything. & quot

does deniro even appear in this movie ? talk about false advertising .
i wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star , because this movie certainly does n't deserve any . i 'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that i could write a better script than this . please do n't waste your money . as the person who reveiwed this before me said , watch this only to make fun of the bad acting . oh , and for the record , you can actually hear the director yelling `` cut ! '' at the end of one of the scenes
i find it disheartening that so many of king 's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations ... and perhaps it 's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film ... i 'm not sure . delores claiborne , stand by me , misery , carrie , shawshank redemption , the shining , and the green mile all did well . then we are treated to stinkers like it , maximum over-drive , dreamcatchers , thinner , the running man , firestarter ... and of course , this one . did i forget to mention stephen king 's own remake of the shining ? he should have settled for the original . this film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film ... and , in fact , that 's what it should have been . the film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book . they jumped into the darker elements way too quickly . there is barely a set up for the horror to come . that they left out norma crandall was very disappointing as she added to judd 's character so much . he 's barely even interesting in the film . fred gwynn turned him into a goofy , drawling , old man . over-acted . not subtle at all , as his character was in the book . ellie , the daughter , was a terrible actress . i am sure they could have found a better actress than her . she was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural . even the cinematography was badly done . everything is way too bright for the plot line . too many primary colors . it felt like they were on the set of a soap opera . at least it matches the acting of the principal characters . they tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects , but set in the backdrop of a badly made film , it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable . the only way this film could be considered `` scary '' is with the cheap haunted-house `` boo ! '' scare tactics ... like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder . why would they choose mary lambert to direct this film ? she barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos . and , as expected , beyond this flop , she has barely done anything worth mentioning . well , except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film . let 's hope the <NUM> re-make is better .
what a shame that gems such as longfellow serenade , signs , lady-oh and both sides now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that do appear . given mr. diamond 's long and illustrious career , this release disappoints . again , what a shame . so much potential and so little fulfillment
yep , that 's right ... a volcanic eruption in nyc is the premise for this hokey but mildly diverting disaster flick . seems like nasty doctor michael ironside is trying to develop a source of geothermal energy and doing so he starts a volcanic rift under the big apple . dedicated tunnel worker costas mandylor is the first to discover the lava flow but of course no one believes him . enter alexandra paul as his geologist ex-wife who is called in to find out what 's going on . the fbi is certain it 's the work of terrorists , while a high city official is secretly funding ironside 's experiment . the movie is nowhere as intense as the earlier volcano , as it 's pending doom never seems large scale enough for a good disaster movie , and the effects are n't that impressive . diverting entertainment for fans of the genre

do n't waste your time or your money on this film . trust the detailed negative reviews provided on this site . i can only assume the positive comments were written by someone affiliated with the film to get their `` star '' rating up . could have been so good , the result was unfortunate
these bean cartoons are to comedy what cardboard is to cookies . the humour found in identifying with the live mr. bean is lost in simple crude cartooning and wishy-washy colors . not even the occasional grunt from atkinson brings these boring drawings and predictable story-lines to life . not watchable , even by great fans of bean or by children
this is a tremendously expensive reference that one should expect to be trustworthy . but it is n't . nor is it as definitive as should be expected , though it does have some fascinating entries , such as the role of dogs in the history of food . for the price , there should be line drawings for some of the more unusual fruits and veg , because as it is , the verbal descriptions would lead a reader to think that something looked quite different than it does . so i use these two volumes with caution , referencing further anything said here before i take it as a given . although some other reviewers here have criticized the dryness of style , that is what i want in this sort of thing , so i have no complaints there . of far more importance is the slant that many of the articles have , which clearly have a political agenda that the information is wrapped around . so , while the bibliographies for same are useful , they also are selectively chosen . given the guides to food now , and the many histories , i would think that a few books judiciously chosen are better value than this one reference , though if you are monied , this is an interesting addition to your library , to be read with a grain of salt in every 'oh , my ! i did n't know that .

president ulysses grant called the <NUM> u.s. invasioin of mexico , `` the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation . '' i see whatever piece of the `` american dream '' that immigrants ( legal or not ) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations . pat buchanan has said , `` if people do n't want terrorism , we have to give up our empire . '' i think he 's right , i 'd just add that the same goes for immigration . to curb the influx of economic refugees , we have to reform nafta , end the exploitative behavior of transnationals ( many us-based ) in the maquilladoras , support fair trade , end the dirty work of places like the school of the americas and figures like `` economic hit men , '' and so forth . moreover , wooldridge and others often speak as if the `` minute men '' are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration . thankfully , there are groups like the american friends service committee and border links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration , and far more humane approaches to this complex issue . as general smedley butler said , `` war is a racket , '' and that includes this war on immigrants . there is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence , aerial drones , motion sensors , videocameras , detention centers , and the other equipment of a police state . if we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well , we wo n't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave . rather than wooldridge 's fear and resentment-mongering , i 'd recommend the upcoming boook by free speech radio news host , deepa fernandes , which is titled , `` targeted : homeland security and the business of immigration . '' we could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of mexico 's own movements for justice . there are many books and dvds available regarding the courageous efforts of the zapatistas . `` i would rather die on my feet , than live a lifetime on my knees . '' -emiliano zapata
boy , this dvd is just a jumble of old episodes , which are fine . but , it 's just not cohesive overall . feels very disjointed when watching it . the good thing is my <NUM> year old loves watching it . she only learned `` m '' and `` u '' from this overpriced dvd , but at least she likes watching it . i must say , i was afraid she would n't like `` meet the letters '' after watching this dvd countless times , but she does ( i highly recommend meet the letters , if you want your young ones to actually learn ) . oh , she could call out all the letters after watching `` meet the letters '' for about <NUM> weeks . is it because she watched the jumbled `` jungle '' for about <NUM> weeks earlier ? maybe . but , she sure heck did n't call out the letters while watching it ( other than `` m '' and `` u '' as mentioned ) . this is a good dvd that entertains . i would 've actually gave it at least <NUM> stars if it were n't for the price ( $ [ ... ] b & n ) , considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with elmo , zoey and telly .
one would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many oliver stone movies in a row . but , i see stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer , unless you count his homage to fidel castro . the only movies worth watching are his early movies , salvador and platoon , which for some reason did n't make the cut . instead , you have the insufferable born on the fourth july and his conspiracy theories on the death of jfk , with a whole lot of filler in between
apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film , but when i re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so , i found it to be . . . well , nearly unwatchable . what 's so bad about it ? well , how shall i begin . . . ( <NUM> ) sean connery is a dud . there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond , but here , he seems like he 's just going through the motions . to be fair , he had no decent material to play . the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging <NUM> ; he seems suitably worn-out at various points , and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before . but these are grace notes ; by and large , connery is stiff as a board here . ( <NUM> ) the action scenes are uninspiring . i 'm not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films , but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes . here , the action is strictly second-rate . ( <NUM> ) kim basinger and barbara carrera , though great to look at , give terrible performances . ( <NUM> ) there is literally no reason to see this in favor of `` thunderball , '' of which it is a remake ; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments , and this remake makes zero improvements . in fact , the plot merely becomes muddled . ( <NUM> ) there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles . rowan atkinson 's comic scenes , though brief , are painfully unfunny , not to mention out of place . the actor playing the `` new '' m is odious ; and whoever it is playing q is n't very good , either . ( <NUM> ) the music is bad . the title song is boring , and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon . i could n't care less that the james bond theme is missing ; it 's not what is n't there that 's bad , it 's what is there . all in all , i 'd have to say that -- unless we 're counting the <NUM> version of `` casino royale '' -- this is the worst of the james bond movies . it 's worth seeing if you 've never seen it before . . . but that 's about it , in my opinion

i 'm so glad i got this book from the library instead of buying it . it was worth the 75c hold fee , but not much more . i was expecting `` stuff you can make with whatever small amounts of yarn you have in your stash '' , but got `` stuff you can make with a few skeins of expensive luxury yarns '' . there are very few projects in here i 'd ever consider making . if i should decide i want to make one , i 'll check the book out again , but i wo n't be buying this for myself or anyone else , ever
i give this movie <NUM> star because it lies to the viewer . this movie is not bram stoker 's dracula , but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story . if it was named something else or even kept the name dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name i 'd give it <NUM> stars . if you want to see the real dracula story first read the actual book by bram stoker , then watch the silent film nosferatu . nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right . dracula is a monster , he 's not a star crossed lover at all and was n't intended to be . people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply is n't one . it 's a horror tale , not a vieled porn book , and certainly not a love story . if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him
and was n't it awful . slow , nonsensical , not to mention boring .... basically , it 's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl . and then bad stuff happens . that is all the book is about . no sub-plot , no nothing . to be honest , the best bit was when the main character 's baby gets shot and dies . the book ( about <NUM> pages long , to be honest i ca n't remember . i do n't want to remember ) is really slow to start with , and stays that way until the last <NUM> pages where a million things happen at once . it is way too descriptive , and nothing remotely interesting happens . and then it just ends . it was really empty . i have read other `` classics '' such as war of the worlds , animal farm , lord of the flies , etc , all of which had more substance and staying power than this .
too long-winded . too many seldom-encountered words employed . too much evasiveness by the author , in withholding clear meaning from what he was saying rather than transmitting that meaning to the reader readily , willingly , succinctly and immediately . a painful reading experience , not an enjoyable one , unfortunately . the author seemed to be trying to prove his cleverness , superiority and literary prowess ( all of which he clearly possesses ) rather than simply telling a story . it was a relief to get this book over with . the story was good , but the author took too long to tell it , with too many asides and meanderings . this book is maybe a good lesson in why authors ought to try to be brief , clear , succinct . authors will be taking up the reader 's time without paying the reader for that time , and also are locking diligent readers into having to finish a story once they start reading it , and the author does n't have an automatic right to more time than the story deserves . did this story really need <NUM> pages of tight-set text ?
yuck . on first listen , this album sounds like robbie trying to do madonna and then eminem . the vocals are monotonous , the beats the same . it 's dance music , and not my cup of tea . i 'll give it another listen , but i 'm guessing there will be maybe <NUM> songs i 'd want to keep on this cd . pau
here we go again .... another tortured collection of three chord , twelve barre delta blues . in truth , these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited robert johnson first recorded them ; now hearing clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying . how many times can we hear `` i woke up this morning , baby ; my cow just up and died ..... da dum , da dum , da dum ..... i woke up this morning , baby . my cow just up and died . da dum , da dum , da dum .... so i drank a bottle of hooch and i began to cry .... da dum , da dum , da dum .... '' come on , people ! if this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization . when eric clapton plays cole porter , duke ellington , and rogers and hart on his guitar -- -unaccompanied -- -- chords , melody and bass line -- -- like django reinhardt , wes montgomery , and joe pass -- -- then maybe i 'll consider him a great guitarist . today 's youth are clueless about almost everything , and guitar virtuosity is no exception . i do n't believe clapton has ever heard of key modulation , arpeggios , or chord substitutions . in truth , he is an average rock guitarist , and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing , that 's not saying much . for anyone to call him a great guitarist , let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived , is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity . it 's like saying madonna is the greatest singer of all time . odds are those who make such vacuous , ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie woodstock generation who would n't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him ( which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time ) . i know we 're living in the age of grand mediocrity , but enough is enough . go buy a wes montgomery , django reinhardt or barney kessel album and listen to sophisticated , nuanced , and soulful guitar viruosity . if you have half a brain , you 'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated , unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like clapton and hendrix were great guitarists . if after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that clapton is a great guitarist , here 's what you do : pick up your fender strat , turn the amp volume up to <NUM> , smoke a joint , and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist . eric clapton is a great guitarist ! what a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s .
i am disappointed with this cookbook . i was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a toaster oven . what i call the `` nitty gritty '' of using a toaster oven . obviously i am wrong , the book contains nothing basic , standard or instructional about using a toaster oven
i remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in <NUM> seconds . the caller gets on and says , `` chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc . i guess hot streets would have slowed the process ..... anyways hot streets is further document of chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is ...
i actually caught this crapfest on the sci-fi channel the other night . that 's exactly what it was , a crapfest . i did n't even know i was looking at nick carter until i read some of these reviews , which i consider a blessing . no wonder that family has so many problems . and such veteran actors such as judge reinhold and stacy keach must have been really desperate for cash if they committed to this schlock . and do n't even get me started on the headless horseman . he was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy <NUM> 's science fiction movie . if you want to see the best version of the story , watch tim burton 's sleepy hollow . if you want originality , either watch ichabod and mr. toad or read the original story
i came across levy 's profile on a popular personals/music website , and i found nothing but good reviews and great comments , so i decided to spend my extra birthday money on their album . as i sat and listened to it , i kept wondering if i accidentally received the wrong cd ; everything i heard sounded like coldplay . now , i do n't have anything against cover bands , but when you copy someone else 's music , you should at least give them proper respect and acknowledge that you 've made their music into your own . on this album , levy mimicked much of the trademark guitar sound and texture of coldplay . much of their personally filtered reviews taunt their work as completely original , and at times , they even sound as if levy might be musically revolutionary or something . in regards to the actual musical content of the album , i find it lukewarm , stale and , well , plain boring . steer clear of this one if you 're looking for something new and different . after seeing several reviews stating this kenny anderson guy wrote my review , i figured i should add a realname tag to show that more than just kenny anderson thinks levy sucks
it is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one . personally i can not blame him . throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes , ( note i am the most un pc person in world so if i am put off it says somthing ) and an apperance by larry king , and and you have everything wrong with american movie making . please note- jon lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turke
i am so mad at disney and their movie `` hercules '' because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories . i like greek mythology , but the movies have not been good at all . and this weak effort is not going to do anything about it . the plot has been changed completly , pegasus is never mentioned in the real version , he is not trying to impress people , he had no trainer , the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned , the hydra fight is because of a different reason , ugly characters , hercules was never in love with a chick , hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either , and all kinds of things that i wo n't mention . do n't buy this movie because it is completly different , why do n't you read greek mythology instead of watching this
the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo , using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him . it 's the only scene that made me laugh . the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home , and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids , are both weak . playboy dad is not interesting , and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie . the other dad , reiser , is uncomfortable to watch . his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter , but that too is uncomfortable to watch . the later scene , up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him , is completely unbelievable . the fact is , that particular girl would not say those things to her dad . she does n't love him . she does n't need him at all . she 's done with him . the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb . that does n't happen . if you want to write a cartoon , get warner brothers to draw it for you . have the road runner in it , or bugs bunny . the film gives us comfort food at the end , with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids . the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young , but once they hit a certain age , in double digits , you are done . daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on . kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad . fittingly , i saw this film on father 's day . to sum the whole movie up , janeane garofalo is funny , randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end , and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying . the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on . but it takes a subject on , so at least that 's something . it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family
this book is about dave 's late high school years , while he was in the foster care system . this book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times . i thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system , which we were initially led to believe . but the book turned out to be more of a `` guy '' book , talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends . this might be interesting to teenage boys , but for a broader audience , this book did n't seem as interesting . the experiences in foster care did n't really seem to come through as much . the book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times . as a result , the book became a little boring . i also did n't care for some of the foul language in the book , which to me , often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across . about the review from the lady from new zealand ... it was not necessary to single me out in your review . the point of these reviews is to review the book , not the reviewers . secondly , i did not like the book . plain and simple . that is ok. not every book jives with everybody . i do n't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring . i said that the book itself was boring and to me , it seemed to lose focus . you do not have to agree with me , as i do n't agree with you . i am free to express my opinions on these books . and yes , i read `` lost boy '' , but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in dave 's life . you see , i was in <NUM> foster homes as a kid , and to me , reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me . so please , just focus your reviews on the books , not on the reviewers . i had a legitimate opinion on the book and i expressed it . i 'm sure i 'll lose helpful votes on what i 've just said to `` gingerwoman '' , but it 's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other
i ordered this on november <NUM> , and even though amazon have been listing this as being 'in stock ' for a week or so , my order still has n't even shipped yet . i have asked amazon to provide a reason for this , but they have n't done so ... i think it 's terribly misleading of amazon to list something as being 'in stock ' when orders placed two months ago have n't been filled yet . buyer beware ...
i struggle with this movie . i 'm a die-hard fan of jean-claude van damme , so part of me really likes this movie . but the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script , uninteresting characters , and horrendously bad acting ( save for jcvd himself ) . having said this , i can honestly reccomend it to fans of van damme . they will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his indian buddy and pickin ' up chicks . if this appeals to you , there should n't be any reason why you would n't like `` desert heat . '' if even one of this does n't sound good , stay far away
if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na
the dvd was okay and i needed it for a gift ( which i was late for - my fault ) . i received it in <NUM> days but it arrived totally smashed . it was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing . the outside of the package was marred but not ripped open . but when i opened it i was horrified that the entire case was crushed . i delicately took it apart and it seemed that the dvd was untouched so i put it in another generic case that i had around the house . that was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and i could n't fit it in my case . because i was late with my gift , i did n't have time to send it back to you . the price was right , the service was quick , just bulk up on your shipping a little
i was taken aback by how convoluted and overreaching this text was . i guess i expected more . i found myself having to read and reread certain paragraphs and sections of this book just to understand what telford was attempting to say . i found his open hostility toward the traditional position of inerrancy troubling . one reviewer says that work `` shows how the paradigm of inerrancy is fatally flawed . '' he shows no such thing . he approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts . one way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent . this he did do . he seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists . ultimately , work 's overhaul ( i.e. , paradigm shift ) for viewing the word of god was simply over the top and without warrant . i note that this book came out in november <NUM> , but i have yet to see bible colleges and seminaries adopting work 's new paradigm and dialect , and with a sales ranking of 711,096 , his book is likely not going to usher in his `` new paradigm .
i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman . i also purchased it because of someone else 's amazon review ( they sounded like they really knew what they were talking about ) . i am glad i bought it used , because if it were new , i would feel that i 'd been cheated . the movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor 's office . there was no sense of suspense , and i was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea ( mind you , i 'm not the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy ) . the dialogue throughout was tedious and trite ; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line , as well as the director and the editor . the plot was , in some respects , totally illogical , and at other times nonsensical . even previous scenes do n't tie in neatly enough at the end . the plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible . the choices the characters make - whether restless , bored , frustrated - do n't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film ( like a greedy , unwashed vampire ) . the movie features a wealthy , bored couple . i was also bored . but i 'm not wealthy . however ! all the actors did their best within the limitations of this film . polly walker was very convincing as a sensitive , but hypercritical wife . in fact , i 'd say she provided the best performance , and her character was the most three-dimensional and human . they should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character . norman reedus was fairly genuine as the young man , although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive . he failed to grab my empathy . which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded , wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment . alan rickman did his usual subtle work , but it was so subtle that i thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming . his attempt at an american accent did not fly too well . later in the movie , however , he becomes much more interesting . the end lacked passion and was not surprising at all ; it was entirely predictable . for rickmanistas , yes , you get to see alan naked . so , just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy . i have always admired alan rickman - i 'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film . so , i give it two stars . * yawn
i hate this music because it is boring , stupid , and downright weak . let 's go over the songs . <NUM> . `` the tide is high 0/10 i hate this song ! blondie is the worst group in music history . <NUM> . `` dancing queen '' 0/10 i hate abba to no end ! <NUM> . `` i just do n't know what to do with myself '' 0/10 i hate dusty springfield until armageddon comes . i hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre , sinister , and devilish . so if you want music then look somewhere else , otherwise , stay clear of this mess
steve albini has got to be the most sanctimonious , self-possessed , pompous [ person ] in the entire music industry . he emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another . he 's hailed as some sort of guru by `` alternative '' people , when he 's actually nothing but an uninformed , homophobic piece of * * * * . in the song `` jordan , minnesota '' he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net . ever heard of research , steve ? guess not , you 've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment ( yeah , i read the tour diary ) . as for the `` music '' , this is a record by and for people who hate music
i 've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist . my wife and i got a couple of her disc 's , plus that `` very best of '' cd and was really looking forward to her latest , but this one ... zzzzzzzz , makes me wonder what they 're putting in sheryl 's coffee . some reviewers are saying there 's `` heart and soul '' all over this album ? that may be , but it 's also very slick dullsville stuff too . as for the album cover graphics , i do n't see the roger dean yes covers or the <NUM> 's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote , but a very `` modern '' graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using . kelly clarkson , the vines , the donnas , the list goes on . highlights : good is good ( i guess it 's time for a new `` very best of '' collection )
the rebel-with-a-heart-of-gold-who-learns-the-meaning-of-love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures , which were very popular in the movies and on tv at that time . the & quot ; european & quot ; setting got elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction were basic , to say the least , and the music was uninspired and badly mixed on record . the movie does have one of presley 's best set of opening productiom numbers : & quot ; long legged girl .. & quot ; and others are rousing tunes delivered with that presley panache often missing from his late-'60s efforts . but about <NUM> minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan reaches for a magazine . an interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a true & quot ; discovery & quot ; - an english teenager making her screen debut with elvis presley ! she handles the light-hearted assignment very well indeed - even the & quot ; old macdonald & quot ; sequence which usually is reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack album cut
an excellent and important story that needs to be told over and over again . but for those of us who use non-fiction books such as this for research as well , this book lacks a crucial element -- an index . i could not recommend this book to someone researching information on the holocaust because there is no way for someone to retrieve important information without laboriously searching page by page through the book . when will publishers learn what researchers and librarians know , a non-fiction book without an index is not complete
i thought this was one of the worst books i ever attempted to read . the whole plot is just plain ridiculous . bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime . when the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years . such rubbish -- do n't people see how contrived and unrealistic , not to mention immoral , this is ? avoid this one
oh my god , i ca n't believe they actually released this movie onto video ! ... i had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film .... thank god it was on hbo ( i actually thought it was an hbo made-for-tv movie ) ... anyways , this movie was sooo bad , i 'm surprised that the air force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this movie .. seriously .. there 's no plot and horrendous acting , but what can you expect from a movie with the title & quot ; stealth fighter & quot ; ? besides that , the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny .... like the ending , i wo n't ruin it or anything ( would n't that be bad ! ) ...... just do n't bend over to pick up your beer ( probably # <NUM> by that point in the movie ) because you might miss the whole ending ... it 's over that quick ! one example of why this movie stinks so bad : ice-t walks onto an airforce base ... decides to meander over to a hanger , knocks down a couple of & lt ; good & gt ; guys that look like offensive-tackle-types ... then just jumps into a stealth fighter ( that happens to have the keys in it , and is fully gassed up ) ... and flies away non-chalantly .... and he does n't even rap ! anyways , might be good if you 're inebriated and need a good laugh .... otherwise , avoid this like a port-a-potty at a buffet concert ... like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy from the simpsons , & quot ; worst ..... movie ...... ever ! & quot
i thought this book was about the autobiography of benjamin franklin . this is not the book i was thinking about . it was a book written by benjamin franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography . the book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography . the book title says it is 'compleated ' autobiography . the book 's title should be 'last memoirs of benjamin frankilin
the book i received appears a very cheap copy of the original book . there is no isbn and copyright page , even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy . what 's the story ? ? you pay $ <NUM> for a book you expect to get a quality printed book . it mentions that it is published by harper collins though i am unable to find any reference to it on their website . i believe amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation
over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original <NUM> classic film directed by zoltan korda . even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv-movie quality . beau bridges is generally a good actor , but he is terribly miscast on this film . go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself
i have purchased ( and returned ) four , count 'em , four green mile soundtrack cd 's because of numerous skips . i keep going back , hoping the problem has been fixed , but no luck . i wrote warner brothers about this and i have not received a response to date . has anyone else run into this frustrating problem
after reading this dull uninformative text , i no longer want to succeed . i just want my money back . there 's a reason why many of mr. godin 's books are currently out of print . let 's hope this one goes soon
mackinnon writes with smoothe , poetic prose , that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women . the logical flaws only start there . the book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history , just as marx 's work ( mackinnon 's ideal ) was . i recommend it only because of the woefully influential effect it is having on the u.s. judicial system - know thine enemy
this book could be a great book for the unergrad intro to structures course . it has a nice writing style , it is easy to understand , and has plenty of example problems . however , it is full of errors . it think someone in my class would find a new error at least once a week
pink floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago i heard the scissor sisters do a cover of comforably numb on saturday night live . it was the worst song i have ever heard . the scissor sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on . the song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing comfortably numb . i hope the scissor sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time
.. whats all that about ? i 'm putting this crap on ebay first chance i get , i 'm totally disgusted at the editing , not because of how it was edited at the time of original release , but because they have not extended the songs to there original length . ten years after 's ' i cant keep from crying ' with extended guitar solo from alvin lee , was nearly <NUM> minuites long and they put barely <NUM> minuites of it on here . this could have been made into an extended package , like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been . there is little enough footage of ten years after & alvin lee out there , yet jethro tull 's full isle of wight 'full ' <NUM> hour set has been released on dvd . nice remastering , shame about the footage .
i ca n't even begin to describe how much this band sucks . suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like staind and taproot . i bought this because i was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like helmet and quicksand , but i was severely disappointed . this is a cd for people who like their music simplistic , plodding , one-dimensional , and repetitive . wonder what 's next ? -- how about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it ! after the third song of lifeless droning , it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated . i 've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it , but i 've concluded that i wo n't be able to fully appreciate this band until i can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time
if you 're looking for some of `` jumping joe 's '' classic blues ( see rick `` shaq '' goldstein 's previous five star review of `` blues deluxe '' ! ) this is not the cd for you . if you want middle of the road rock guitar , and not the full `` smoldering , cauldron , of thunder and lightning , guttural , volcanic , power , vocals , that `` jumping joe '' , is capable of , this is for you . for a true `` jumping joe '' blues fan , the only thing this cd will do for you , is complete , your collection of his music , and you wo n't wonder if you missed something . in closing , a personal note to `` jumping joe : `` please record more classic electric blues ! when you put out something like `` blues deluxe '' you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under <NUM> years old ! this cd is beneath you and your loyal blues , `` street gang !
about half the reviewers here claim that these are * not * the original versions of the films . the rest claim that the `` original versions '' in this set are , in fact , the original versions . some reviewers claim that the sound is only dolby digital , while the box pictured above has thx right on it . what gives ? which is it ? next poster , please address this . thanks
the music on this album is performed so exquisitely ; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating , that one is almost tempted to forget what a `` what for ? '' musical this is . donna murphy plays the title character of fosca , a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky . she lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome , virile giorgio . giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful , but vapid clara , a married woman back home . however from the time giorgio comes into fosca 's sphere , she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him . she shows up everywhere he happens to be ; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity . to depict fosca musically , sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career . everything is so lugubrious , dark , portentous , tragic ; punctuated by militaristic strains ( with snare drums ) because the soldiers like to ... umm ... march . in the end , giorgio is worn down enough by fosca 's attentions that he succumbs . he believes he has fallen in love with her , shortly after which she ... dies . as i mentioned earlier , the material is beautifully performed ( marin mazzie and jere shea render the opening `` happiness '' with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality . donna murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting `` loving you . `` ) , but you come away wondering what the point of it all is . if sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease , then he succeeds admirably
too lisa loeb for me . sorry . maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
there is no song worse to me than `` everybody loves somebody sometime '' and that one dud spoiled it for me . i hate that song so much . the others are okay , but this one dud - that is the one song i never want to hear nor would i ever inflict it on anybody . it 's heinous .
i bought this book for ideas and best practices . i work in retail design . the quality of the printing of the book was not very good ; photos did n't give much of a sense of scale , materials used . and the examples seemed very dated to me . if you are a retail design professional , you are better off heading to a local mall , taking some notes and pics yourself
first off , robert deniro as the monster . i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone . they did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york . second , kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but i laughed . we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad . i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn 's face .
i found the plot of this book impossible to follow . it contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches . the hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason . and there are only so many times i can read variations of `` he swung his sword really hard '' and `` it was a really scary dragon . '' the illustrations are quite beatiful , though
i hate to trash on an american classic ... but this was truly horrible . i thought my son would like this due to the flying car . it took hours of torture to get to that scene . horrible , horrible film . mindless , drawn-out banter , and weak story line . our copy eventually broke ( stepped on ? ) -- - we felt sooo lucky to have it gone . `` one star '' seems like a generous rating
i agree with the reviewer who found this macabre . normally i like jan brett 's work a lot , but i do n't think that death should be portrayed as cute and funny , nor do i think that young children should be given the impression that death is a temporary state
oh my goodness this is one the best cd 's i 've bought . finally a cd you can share with the one you love ( i mean really love ) . this is not for boyfriend and girlfriend love cute-sy stuff ... this is for serious lovers til the end , no matter what . i ai n't there yet with anybody , but boy does this cd excite me to know i will feel like that one day . to think it was only $ <NUM> ! ! ! i would 've paid had i known how excellent it was . kenny and chante celebrate love and so do i ! ! ! get this cd now ! ! and dance , laugh , kiss and `` stuff '' with your loved one !
i took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and i have been into thrillers lately . so , i tried it . the scenery was terrific , the setup had lots of promise , and the cinematography was eerie . so , what went wrong ? easy .... the plot was empty and as others have stated , nothing ever really came of anything . there were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing . again , great camera work and the building was truly creepy .... but thats not what makes a great thriller . you have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any . and the characters .... uggggh ! the film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them i would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow , painful way . go ahead and try it if you 'd like but i suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices . ultimately , it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters . its not the worst i 've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour . not recommended
which is n't a good thing . if you 've seen any recent horror flicks within the past <NUM> years ( taking lives , wrong turn , i still know what you did last summer , scream ) , then you know it 's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys , cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys . and scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end . i almost fell asleep in a few of those movies , that 's how lame , tiring and boring they are . fortunately , for this film , it has jessica alba and seth green , who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see . seth green is hilarious as the main characters buddy , and jessica alba is more then sexy . however , the movie is beyond cheesy ( like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window , smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush , but it ca n't escape the microwave . or , when the lady ( played by vivica a . fox ( kill bill ) ) is hit by a car , which is backing up , and then is sent <NUM> feet . uh huh , that 's realistic . ends sarcasm . ) then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head . and how exactly did his buddies get back ? they do n't explain anything and assume everything is magical . it delivers the comedy pretty well , thanks to seth green for that , but is just too silly , far too cheesy and extremely lame ( a hand that is possessed ? please , give me a break .
ewf is perhaps the greatest band of our time . they had the best songs for a <NUM> year span and yet the record companies continue to put together greatest hit packages on one cd . how the heck can you have an ewf greatest hits on one cd ? impossible . hey record company , while you 're at it , do the beatles , elvis , stevie and frank too
this book has several mentions of the baha ' i faith in it , referring to the faith as & quot ; an offshoot of islam & quot ; , and in one part quoting someone as making the baha'is out to look like violent animals . i will never read anything by this author again , she may be aware of iran 's history and politics , but is very miseducated in the area of the baha ' i faith ( not bahaism as she writes it ) . the baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes
i have n't been able to read it yet because the print is so small ! that 's the only thing i can base my review on . i 'm sure it 's a fine book if you can read it
brian hinton 's both sides now is a complete disaster . what could have been a promising biography of mitchell is instead a garbled mess . indeed , hinton 's text is relatively void of biographical information . rather , hinton relies on a handfull of interviews published of mitchell 's , and he quotes from them in such large chunks that the reader would be the wiser to check out the interviews from their sources . following a brief , and flawed , biographical section , hinton uses the rest of the text as a forum for his interpretations of mitchell 's work . album by album , song by song , hinton gives his own personal commentary on mitchell 's music so that the text ends up reading like a diary of hinton 's own personal reflections . moreover , hinton 's analysis of mitchell 's songs are sometimes so off-base and confusing that the reader is left wondering how he comes to these conclusions . finally , his constant personal comments in the text make it seen like nothing more than a high school writing assignment
i may be repeating what others have said in previous reviews , but i just had to vent over this book . after reading interview with the vampire , and the other vampire chronicles before merrick , i was highly disappointed over this book . the action and references to voodun were vague and boring . the book revolves around a plot concocted by david talbot and louis the vampire to use merrick in order to contact the ghost of claudia . then , the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of merrick mayfair , a character anne rice fails to develop as a complex individual . the action in this book is cheesy , typical , and extremely predictable . the book introduces characters that are related to merrick , and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader . the vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious , yet dangerous , and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels . the vampires in merrick , especially louis , are portrayed as weak and gutless . yes , louis is a tortured soul , but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel , and his weak nature is irritating to read about . compare the vampires in merrick to the same vampires portrayed in queen of the damned , like the characters of akasha and kayman , who enjoyed `` devouring the marrow from their victims ' bones '' . the vampires in anne rice 's previous books captured the reader 's attention with their viciousness , and vengeaful , yet human qualities . anne rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel merrick as she did in her others . the action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction . the book is also full of references to david 's annoying , perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales . skip this novel , and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles , preferrably her early novels . this just does not cut it
i am a sci-fi / space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley . the cast was solid , the director has talent , and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well ... right ? nope . this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense . the formula kept repeating over and over : something goes wrong + houston advises + astronauts do something = all is well . lather , rinse , repeat . boring , very boring . i never once flet any real tension except for the initial `` problem '' which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end . the problem is that all of the `` issues '' the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly . rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked .... it was just yeah , attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be ok . i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened , maybe a few times , but only for a minute or two . some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting .... how so i must ask ? nothing really happened . it was not emotional at all since the `` struggles '' of the men were so poorly portrayed . to each his own i guess , but <NUM> 1/2 stars ? geeez , just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks ! the family interactions were pretty standard : crying wife , kids asking questions , annoying media attention , etc , etc . yeah , i could feel for the characters to some extent , but again , this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful . i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool , so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and star-trekkish special effects . too bad , i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored . not recommended
watered down folk-psych circa <NUM> . if you think country joe and the fish is too hard rock then this is for you . too too flower power and not very imaginative , in fact it 's rather boring . perhaps it should be retitled exile on yawn street
i decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it . i watched it with my girlfriend . bad idea ... the sex scenes are bad and very short , and the rest is downright boring . this movie is simply bad , and slow , and generally laughable
i do n't really disagree with the other reviewers ' evaluation of piaf . she is truly one of the great artists of the 20th century . i got this set ; and then i got the <NUM> cd 30th anniversary collection . this <NUM> cd set has only a few songs recorded in the late <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's when recording technology could do justice to her voice . the <NUM> cd set has several cd 's recorded toward the end of her career . the recorded sound is outstanding ; and piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end . i know the <NUM> cd is expensive ; but i prefer it above anything else i have by piaf
i was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of nat king cole and daughter . this was some what not up to what i was looking for . skip it
i 'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter -- she loves this dvd- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star -- i love watching her enjoy this dvd ! !
`` sugar '' is an interesting name for this strange , awkward , ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads . while they carry the film over it 's editing , direction , and story hurdles , they ca n't make up for its unevenness . plus the story is entirely too cliche , and i could n't help thinking it was essentially the same story as `` circuit , '' albeit in a different venue ( except i enjoyed circuit . ) i could n't get into this film . why not ? the story lurches around and you are left to wonder `` why '' and `` how '' altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse . something in the description of this film claims it 's funny . i guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny , then you will get a good laugh out of this . i kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile . not so much . i 'd recommend `` circuit '' to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines , and i 'd leave this film on the shelf . it 's redeeeming qualities are few
i agree with the reviewers that thought this book a waste of time and money . i see that it is being sold used for <NUM> cents . i would n't pay half that
huge disappointment . trace was n't that good either . having read all scarpetta 's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one . however , the downhill trend seems to continue . these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing . save your money , do n't buy it . i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far , so i wo n't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details
never shipped . i ordered this before christmas . they said it was in stock . where is it
i 've tried very hard with this album since its release , but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here . the incredible string band , pentangle , bread , love and dreams comparisons are , in my opion , wishful thinking . this is n't due to espers ability as song writers , but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere . this ruins what is otherwise a nice album
the snow queen is an ancient story from northern europe about a beautiful lady with a heart of ice who resides near the north pole , and uses winter to take the lives of innocent human beings , and uses her beauty and charm to seduce innocent men . live action movies and cartoon versions of this story have been made in numerous decades in multiple languages . one of the later ones is this <NUM> hour version by hallmark entertainment . taking place somewhere in scandinavia ; most likely denmark , the setting is a small rural village in the mid 20th century . a father loses his wife to winter , and raises his daughter at their hotel . one day , he hires kai , a young man , to help with labor around the hotel . he and the daughter fall in love , but the snow queen steals kai away . the daughter sets forth on a journey across earth and the four seasons to find the lair of the snow queen to rescue kai . the movie 's story is quite good and offers much promise . but the movie drags too much ; the dialogue is often muted , and the snow queen is somewhat wooden ; not enough emotion . the idea of a beautiful queen of ice is done much better in the chronicles of narnia than here , as bridget fonda does not do much talking at all . the idea of the robbed girl having to travel across the spring , summer and autumn to find kai is quite innovative and only possible by the crew of hallmark , but again it was not done well . the action scenes were somewhat fake , and most importantly , the snow in the winter scenes clearly looked like fake snow . overall , a good attempt but a bad result .
the reviewer who called this a disney `` bait & switch '' hit the nail right on the head ! i , too , remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid , then later on disney channel , and was awaiting these to be released on dvd , as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both ; but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together , third rate offering ! i never cared for the elfego baca story , i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played , but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the `` swamp fox '' episodes ! above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative , and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war , who , with his compatriots , probably contributed as much as george washington , thomas jefferson , or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom , i really loved this story just for itself ! not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set , i have even gone as far as removing it from my `` wish list '' to save the funds of my family and friends , as well ! i shall wait to see , hopefully , if disney will ever release the entire `` swamp fox '' story in a complete set , for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price
okay . agnetha 's first album was number one in uk or whatever , but i think that this is just another abba album ... i love the catchy song : i ca n't shake loose ( no <NUM> uk ) , wrap your arms around me ( no <NUM> uk ) , man , and take good care of yor children . after this album , agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in uk . a very disapointing album , and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly ( from the first recording to the release was <NUM> months ! )
have u heard `` let 's go '' from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne ? he completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like `` let 's go ! ! ! ! ! '' and other dumb rhymes . i never understood why rap did this . think of me as white heavy metal trash if u want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about . heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like trick daddy use their palms ( think about that for a minute ) now if u like trick daddy i have no problem with that . i would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but i get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him . i 'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but i like some rap . listen to eminem , ludicris , or lil'john if u wan na hear some rap with original ideas
not really scary . just loud noises and shots of speeding cars , a spinning fan , and sunsets . oh , there must be some big shocker at the end , right ? not really . there is some notable cinematography and some decent music , but other than that , this was n't even worth a rental for me
i bought this cd based on the reviews for my <NUM> yr. old . some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense . my daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song . ( `` there 's a little wheel a-turnin in my heart '' and `` pig on her head '' ) . i really did n't like `` i 'm a mess '' which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter . i would recommend instead karyn henley 's cds which i found to be the best out there for the toddler age group ( 3-5 yrs ) . she tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter . the songs are wholesome and innocent
this came out when i was <NUM> : it would have been far too 'difficult ' an album for a young whippersnapper and i was only vaguely aware that the bunnymen existed at that time . in my early teens i bought a few bunnymen singles and ocean rain ; now , <NUM> years later , i 'm trying to fill in the rest of the bunnymen jigsaw . after a week of repeated listening , i 'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways . either , you judge it by its stand out songs , which are far and few between : if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than <NUM> tunes afterwards , you 're doing better than me . alternatively , you can put it in context : appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-u2 sound , ( which i have to say does precious little to endear it to me ) . if you 're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake , it 's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from joy division to u2 within a couple of years . however , if like me you think both joy division and u2 are vastly overated , this really is n't going to do much for you . it 's determindly bleak , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but this also captures the bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody : only 'over the wall ' and ' a promise ' deliver a decent hook . i 've seen heaven up here described as a work of 'rare beauty ' . it can also cause a tense , nervous headache . if you 're interested in the early <NUM> 's british underground scene , then of course you should hear it , along with the other bunnymen albums . compared to the lush scott walker-esque ocean rain , though , this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding .
it 's a truism that great novels make lousy movies . for evidence of that fact , you need look no further . as the great hollywood novel ( at least there 's no convincing competitor ) , it was inevitable that `` day of the locust '' would hit the screen eventually . and when the time came , some effort was made to ensure the job was done right , beginning with the selection of the director , john schlesinger , a literate british expatriate with a superb track record . but the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry , in film as in everything else . `` locust '' was made during the period when many people considered william atherton to be an actor . you can see him in a number of major films , his expression never changing , with all the emotional impact of a log . it 's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct . but it 's not all atherton 's fault , because nobody comes to life in this flick . not even karen black , one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever , for all that she 's playing a hooker ( karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role ) . not even old pro burgess meredith , as her deadbeat old man . donald sutherland reveals a flicker or two , for all that he 's supposed to be playing a lump . the sole exception is jackie earle haley , who portrays the evil-minded child actor adore with truly demonic intensity . maybe they should have let him direct . it would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull , but sclesinger brings it off . i do n't know how -- this is , after all , the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for cold war traitor guy burgess look enlightening and entertaining in `` an englishman abroad '' . maybe the milieu overwhelmed him . it 's happened to other people . it all comes to a head at the climax , which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of la by atherton 's todd . in a single truly effective scene , the distraught homer simpson murders the noxious child actor adore . and then ... well , if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history , here you are . it 's as if schlesinger said , `` okay , this the 30s , and there were nazis around during the 30s -- so let 's make the rioters nazis ! '' thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks ( they look like a chorus of leatherfaces from `` texas chainsaw massacre '' ) stand in one spot goose-stepping . every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield . and that 's your riot . to top things off , schlesinger then gives us a `` symbolic '' coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we 've seen for the past two hours . nathanael west had an unbelievably tough career as an author . his publisher went bankrupt a week before `` miss lonelyhearts '' was due to be published . he died in a car crash only a short time after `` locust '' appeared . then they went and made this movie . remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair .
there 's not much to say . the book is n't confusing because the material is too technical -- it 's often confusing because the author does n't go in enough depth ; it 's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented , such as hamilton 's law , but no examples on its applications are put forth . i find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook . it also does n't help that the book does n't come with a cd-rom , or any additional material , unless you purchase the teacher 's edition ... reading this textbook makes me yearn for campbell .
this book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as `` god '' , `` money '' , `` power '' , `` love '' etc . for each theme , the author presents a few movies relating to it . it did n't take long to realize that higgins is a liberal christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls . the values promoted are christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism . higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the church ( which i think he means evangelical christians ) though he does n't name names . and the reason for the criticism is that they do n't uphold the 'true message ' of christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice ' and liberal ethics in general . higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'church ' for judging other 's behaviors as sinful . the subtitle `` finding spiritual fingerprints in culturally significant films '' itself is somewhat disturbing . the movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality . it is overridden with everything contrary to christianity . saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of god ( i know he does n't actually say that , but its implied ) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core . even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly . so even though i do watch movies , i am very cautious to see much holiness in them . for as much as i did n't like the book , it did introduce me to some new movies which i have now watched and enjoyed .
afi 's debut album is a great deal different from their last few cds . there is no traces of goth or pop punk here , just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics . the problem with this album is it 's all the same , there 's almost no variation , so it 's good when you listen to just a few tracks ( all of which are good ) but put back to back it 's impossible to get through the entire cd without a headache . the two standout tracks for me are `` high school football hero '' and the classic `` i want a mohawk but my mom wo n't let me get one '' . the music reminds me alot of mxpx 's debut cd `` pokinatcha '' , but the lyrics are alot more similar to the offspring . definitely a good cd if you wan na see where the band started and you 're already a fan , but if you 're new to afi and want to backtrack from sing the sorrow or decemberunderground i recomend either black sails in the sunset or the all hallows ep instead
i picked up this book after reading about it on the simple living network , which i found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late joe dominguez and vicki robin and their work & quot ; your money or your life & quot ; . unlike mr. dominguez and ms. robin , who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living , ms. andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism . after reading dominguez , this book is disjointed , preachy and quite frankly , bad . that 's not so say that ms. andrews does n't have some good ideas . she does , but as with so many anecdotal books , they 're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way . if you live an environmentally sensitive life , ms. andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself , but if your goal is to simplify your life , you could do better than spending time on this book
this is an unbelievably bad film . its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer gary ridgeway 's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film 's tawdry , fictionalized action scenes . i had n't known this footage of gary ridgeway existed . a documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie . the movie does n't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity . for example , the extremely amateurish actor who plays ridgeway does n't match the real ridgeway 's physical description at all . the real ridgeway was not a `` tall , handsome , muscular '' fellow . he was shorter , and unassuming-looking . also , the majority of ridgeway 's victims were not the glamorous , seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here . they were lonely , struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the seatac highway . if you want a better insight into the character of ridgeway 's victims and crimes , read ann rule 's book , `` green river , running red . '' in any case , avoid this movie mess .
where the heck is sniff n ' the tears ' `` driver 's seat '' in this soundtrack . it plays at a definite changing point in the movie where floyd comes to tell jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film . it 's a travesty that this song was n't included . but a good soundtrack nonetheles
this book is a big disapointment . the begining chapters have some useful information , but much of it can easily be found on the web . the <NUM> franchises they list have no supporting information on why they 're the best . the information they provide seem like condensed versions of the franchisor 's flyers
you guessed it . i 'm a cracka from england that has no idea or grasp on african american life ; therefore i 'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book . i just figured i would chime in like all racist saltines do . sorry
this review has to start with a couple of admissions . first , i happen to think cyndi lauper ( especially in her later albums ) is an underrated songwriter and performer . most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the <NUM> 's and unfortunately dismiss what she 's done since then . some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs i 've ever heard . on the other hand , i really hate remixes , especially when they 're done solely to try to make `` danceable '' a song that was never intended to be dance music . so i approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear ... excitement that the `` rarities '' would be more of cyndi 's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck , as remixes tend to do . the two rarities on the album are the songs `` the world is stone '' and `` you have to learn to live alone '' . there are also extended versions of `` mother '' and `` what 's going on '' . `` the world is stone '' talks about how people are turning to stone , `` cold to the touch and hard on the soul '' . the instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special . cyndi 's vocals convey the emotional message she 's sending exceptionally well , and it 's a well-written message about there being `` no warmth anymore '' and `` no love anymore '' . while it may be a `` rarity '' it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs . `` you have to learn to live alone '' has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it . you could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in casablanca . cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music , delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what 's a fairly subdued , soft song . the instrumentals on this song are much better than those for `` the world is stone '' . the rest of the album consists of remixes , and as i said above , i generally hate remixes . these are really no exception . if i had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence , that sentence would be : `` how to turn some decent cyndi lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy . '' if you 're into the techno-sounding disco stuff , you might enjoy these , i do n't know . personally , they ruin some decent songs to me . the only good thing i can find to say about them is that at least they did n't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like `` hey now ( girls just wan na have fun ) '' ... if the entire album was like `` the world is stone '' and `` you have to learn to live alone '' i would probably give it something in the 8-10 ( out of <NUM> ) range . those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work . but the <NUM> remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me , and i ca n't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a <NUM> . if it was an album of just the remixes , it would get maybe a <NUM> , and would only rank that high because cyndi 's voice appears in them
i 've been in the software industry for quite awhile , and i 've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh . while there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform , there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine . this book , in summary , is the longwinded rant of one such user . as someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book , and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book , i believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking , without any real interviews ( or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed ) . there are so many factual errrors in this book , its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time , to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know -- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions . this is a smear job , thru and thru , and like most smear jobs its repetitive , self-contradictory , and downright dishonest . i think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves . windows fans like to kick apple and the mac , even when they are down . windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people . if you want to learn more about apple , find another book ... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste
stephen king is the master of writing , and when he wrote the original story : pet sematary , he was on his game , in the zone , and the man . this second movie is someones attempt at cashing in on the original works of the king , and has been poorly done . did , stephen write a second novel ? no . he has so many other stories that they could make into movies , why spend the money on something like this second film . it was a dive-bomb in theaters , that should tell you something . bad -- just bad .
pat califa wrote , `` our culture insists on sexual uniformity and does not acknowledge any neutral difference only crimes , sins , disease and mistakes . '' such we see represented in dr. amen 's book . dr. amen makes reference to what he considers normal sexually in his book . like so many clinicians and diastognicians his normality is of a vanilla world . anything outside of that is referred to as an imbalance in the brain or a disorder . my own research has been focused on debunking the myths about sexuality that are perpetuated in this book . the chapter on addictions and fetishes lacks any creative thinking whatsoever . unfortunately i returned the book to the bookstore due to the limited thinking represented here . sincerely , ilona paris , lmhc
`` dirty dancing '' is still one of my favorite movies of all time . it managed to have a plot and wonderful music . you just ca n't sit still when this music is playing
you do n't need to trust me -- you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the `` frog king '' which is unreadable . someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper . this does not do justice to the tales
in terms of vitalism spiritism supernaturalism , i particularly enjoy this line : `` the organic foods you eat have a spirit of their own , one that will blend with your spirit and strengthen and empower your vital force [ p.354 ] . '' this one is good too : `` when the right herb is selected [ ... ] its vital life force works synergistically with that of the patient [ p.004 ] .

this recording of the new works by theofanidis and higdon is first rate . great performances , and nice to hear along side the copland , which stands out as the real masterpiece . mind you , theofanidis and higdon are obviously really talented composers . i like new music . i like beautiful music . and i do n't usually mind if the new music i hear is beautiful or ugly , has a tune , or not . what matters is that i am pulled in , and not lulled in with cliches or pandering . the theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting to listen to than the higdon . his sense of orchestral color is very strong . but overall , their music is very pretty , and somewhat boring . get this to hear that great copland : it is the piece that on this cd that pulls you in to listen . i know this piece is not the new piece on the cd , but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works
i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about <NUM> of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a <NUM> year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like <NUM> 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , `` i ca n't have more ice cream ! '' so , i would suggest renting `` planet of the vampires '' because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was `` lesmo '' , dubbed as the `` european peter lorre '' who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget .
what a waste . the book is very general in nature . no concrete information on the business itself . the book is not properly bound as it is completely falling apart . save your money and invest it elsewhere
normally , i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started . not the case with `` s '' . i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand . the main character violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs , red hair , just a boozing slut over all . i did n't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her . the ending was n't clear either . i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades . most of the characters just were n't that interesting overall . i missed her interactions with rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor , the handsome <NUM> year old baker henry . usually , there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here . i would vote pass on this one .
i only gave this movie <NUM> stars because of its <NUM> stars : mamie van doren and jayne mansfield . without the presence of these <NUM> bombshells , the film is a complete bomb . as a piece of film history , it has its place . as entertainment , it 's atrocious , even for the time . still , as i 've said , it does have mamie & jayne ! the male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent , although you can say that about a lot of modern films too . only get this film if you 're passionate about its <NUM> lusty blonde actresses . otherwise , get a life
i 've been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo . i 'm just happy i waited untill it came on tv . i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it . the romance was slim to none . i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role . well , i wo n't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it . anyway , i would much rather watch beautiful thing , get real , all over the guy & the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love
i too had to purchase this book for a class . it did not help . there is too much information compacted into one paragraph . then it is very reduntant . each chapter seems to be repeating itself even though it is suppose to be on another subject of philosophy . i would not suggest this book to anyone . it was a good thing i had prior knowledge of philosophy so i could pass my class . if you know nothing of philosophy , this book will only confuse you more
while the murder mystery was well set up , the ending was more of agatha christie ending , with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator . the political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough . this is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet . but you did n't feel that pain from the governor . the <NUM> law robot introduced is n't given the same exploration that caliban was in the first book . you do not get behind his head . the pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us . this missed the boat
please do n't waste your money . it was told in first person in which it was hard to get into the book . i did n't complete beyond <NUM> chapters . i tried !
i too agree with them , i am a pchem student , and the binding on my book is coming off , i need to tape it in order to save it from falling off . yes , the derivation are hard to follow , my professor had to give hand outs on majority of them to show what steps were skipped .
a not bad recording of this , in my view , poor and rather over-rated show . amazing orchestration and the performances of bebe neuwirth and joel grey stop this recording from falling in the gutter of musical tattle . the cast is nothing to get excited about quite frankly , although bebe neuwirth is a real treat as velma . i wish the same could be said about her co-star . reinking , with her voice similar to the noise of clattering shovels , manages to ( allbeit in the `` broadway-darling '' style we have grown accustomed to ) take awfulness to great new heights . the only thing that is good about her performance , quite frankly , is when it stops ... reminiscent of that blissful moment when people stop playing bagpipes . having said this , her acting is great , giving the character of roxie depth and meaning - however ancient she portrays her . this is something gwen verdon tried and failed at . on balance though , reinking 's badness outweighs anything else , sadly . neuwirth with her `` older '' style of voice and singing makes her seem to own the role of velma kelly here , although she does over-do the older-portrayal sometimes . joel grey lights up this recording with a superb performance and with much ease . on the whole , this is n't the best recording if this show i 've heard , but its certainly not the worst . a good buy if you know the show well , but , apart from that , steer clear for now .
the relationships between the various characters were n't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character , lottie , at all . the book seemed to ramble on , and did n't catch my interest . there were a few parts where the action picks up , but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
i live in buffalo and i 'm a big prog rock fan ; so when i saw this cd at the library , i knew i had to give it a free listen . but make no mistake - this cd under-delivers on many levels . i always wanted asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player ( steve howe ) , a top-shelf drummer ( carl palmer ) , and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task ( john wetton ) . but there was always a bit too much `` pop '' , simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me . hey , progressive rock is mostly about `` different '' , complexity and change , right ? asia was a progressive-pop band ( akin to the later albums of todd rundgren 's utopia ) that made good music , but did n't really pioneer much of anything . same with this cd . there 's little here that 's new or better than the studio versions of the songs . palmer 's long drum solo got boring after a while . steve 's acoustic solos can be found on other yes recordings , and done much better there - here , the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he 's playing tuned rubber bands at times . ( honestly , i remember hearing better fidelity from my old kenner close'n'play ! ) o.k. , it was cool to hear steve express his pleasure at playing in buffalo again ! but the so-called `` keyboard solo '' by geoff downs was underwhelming to say the least , and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos . i guess if one loves a band too much , they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any cd by that band , and that 's just fine for those people . however , the objective reality of this cd 's value comes creeping in on many other 's existing reviews : namely , the production quality is sub-par ( to the point of being annoying at times ) ; the vocals and harmonies are often off-key ( you really should n't have to wince this much during <NUM> minutes of music ! ) ; this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on <NUM> disks for some reason ; the packaging and liner notes are scant ; and the performance just does n't add much to the studio versions . this is for asia completists only . asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop cd with their first studio album . i love it . but they never improved upon it , and never stretched out into new territory . perhaps this <NUM> live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from `` good '' to `` great '' . support your local library . ( and in this case , save some cash ! )
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . julia roberts and richard gere should have given every cent they received on this movie for charity ! horrible acting and plot . julia and richard , i hope you get to read this one day .
the story of the strokes is the story of wealth and privilege , and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like lou reed and vu riffs . this was made without rca , and so lacks strokes music . the band apparently wanted nothing to do with it , it is practically diy , with no interviews . this just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project . their 2nd album sucked anyway
this dvd is not shaolin idiot but an older film of stephen chow . it 's really a film called `` look out , officer '' that stephen chow made in <NUM> . shaolin idiot is not out yet to my knowledge . if you want stephen chow 's `` look out , officer '' you should buy this dvd if not , do n't .
i bought this never having problems from amazon.com before . they did not state that this was a sony product and when i received it , all the cd had on it was a root kit virus . it would not even play in my cd player . when i tried to read the cd to copy and burn the `` wav '' files to a new cd so i could just listen to the music , all there were on the cd was executables and no sound files . sony is very poor quality now and i do not want to buy it again
maybe i 'm just not the right demographic for this novel , but i hated the beginning , tolerated the middle and put it down permanently near the end . the model is the canterbury tales of chaucer , but i do n't think it works . i just never got interested in the characters enough to care what happened to them and for me , the story -- stories , really -- never came into focus . i guess the new york times book review should have tipped me off because they compare it to frank herbert 's dune and the foundation series of asimov , both of which , in my opinion have aged really badly . i never realized how bad dune was until i saw the awful movie of it . the fundamental metaphors operating in hyperion seem to be backwards living . well , ok , but i just do n't see what it is a metaphor for . nor , by page <NUM> where i finally gave up , did i care
i feel compelled to add my review , as i bought this cd based on what i'd read here ... what a disappointment . tedious , predictable , unimaginative `` electro-pop '' . there 's so much more interesting stuff out there , and i listen to alot . i found this cd remarkably disposable . no offense ..
was looking forward to seeing this film , quite disappointing . joan cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film . once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing . jennifer anniston is usually pretty good , but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny , i felt . just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line . not a film i will be watching again , sadly .
two quotes from the book : `` patents reflect human arrogance ... '' and `` patents also reflect the arrogance of western civilization ... '' . these two sweeping generalities are unjustifiable and inexplicable yet they are the basis for the book . this book is of no use to anyone who understands intellectual property , patents , copyrights , trade secrets or other forms of original creation deserving of legal protection
if you are a fan of the original empire records , do n't buy the re-mixed fan version ... it 's a big dissappointment . there are added scenes in the movie , and some of the best lines are changed . example : when rex is leaving the store and says `` why do n't you all just fade away . '' yeah , he does n't say that in this version . i was very dissappointed when i saw this , b/c die-hard empire fans do n't want the best lines changed , so this really is n't a `` fan re-mix '' b/c it changes stuff the fans love ! ! ! definitely just buy the regular dvd or vhs version ... it 's much better as an original , not a re-mix ! ! !
atlantic records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts . i do n't see how this kind of drivel , regardless of the musicians ' past records and reputations , could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs . this cd was simply self-indulgent and wasteful . froom is incapable of just playing keyboards , w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of absurdity . atmospheric just do n't cut it if there 's no compelling content to hold it up . and where 's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in hidalgo ? just a strange , disjointed , and goofy effort with no real payoff
guys ... it 's not that good . i have the album on my computer , and i gave it a few listens , but ... it has no substance . it 's not interesting or anything new . it 's catchy . and irritating , after more than a song or two . that 's all ( `` bandages '' is enjoyable once in a while , i will concede ) . if you 're looking for catchy and poppy ( and there 's nothing wrong with that ) , then buy it . if you want something new and original - do n't . and if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like the faint , the bravery , or le tigre .
this could have been a very good documentary , but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me . the camera never stays on any subject for more than <NUM> seconds , film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason , and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene . the events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation , which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film
... when applied to this dvd . it would appear to have been transferred from a vhs copy . it 's so soft as to be impossible to watch . i hope the director 's family ( he died in <NUM> ) is simply holding back the original masters in hopes of making a deal for an authorized dvd version . `` the red balloon '' is such a wonderful little movie -- perhaps the best introduction to the cinema for any child -- but it is almost destroyed by the condition of the source used for this transfer . ca n't we have a version that matches the film 's vision for its 50th anniversary
if you are a blackmore fan stay away from this piece of crap because during the guitar solos all you will see is gillan shaking his butt or `` playing '' the congas and everybody else except , of course , the guitar work . i could n't bear it anymore in the middle of child in time and will certainly not check the rest of this mess . on another level , i am just appaled by the extremely poor musicianship of jon lord ! this guy just stinks so bad that even i could take him on the hammond ; i 'm a guitarist by trade . heck , even blackmore is very ordinary from what i 've se ... heard . ca n't say anything about glover because you ca n't hear what he 's playing . so the only high points of this video , as far as i could stand it , is ian paice 's performance which is excellent as usual and gillan 's incredible voice . a very sad thing because dp was my favorite band and one of the major reasons i took up the guitar in '69 . i can certainly live with the bad sound and picture considering the time that the show took place but absolutely not the crappy playing . this one is no keeper and i simply threw it away , but if you really want to see dp at it 's best go for the concerto for group and orchestra dvd , with the royal symphony orchestra , but there again you wo n't see much of blackmore 's work but the musicianship is way better
i got this book to learn mac os x programming and was very disappointed . there 's way too much info on mac os <NUM> and <NUM> , which is great for people who are migrating old applications ; but if you 're writing new applications like i am , it just gets in the way . many screenshots are old and do not look like os x windows . it talks about cdef resources , which do not work in os x ; it does not talk about the updated way custom controls are done . code samples use waitnextevent ( ) , which is deprecated . there 's nothing on quartz , but lots of info on quickdraw , which is deprecated . nothing on hiview , opengl , etc . it appears that this was a great book in its day , but now , it 'll probably just confuse you
i had totally different expectations of what this book would be like . i thought it would be mini biographies of strong independant women . instead , i found it very much a victim minded book . the author seemed to go off on tangents often about the men in these women 's lives instead of concentrating on the women themselves .
this is the most boring , unmotivating , uninteresting workout i have ever owned , yoga or other . i am exceptionally disappointed , as it was voted best workout dvd of <NUM> by self magazine . i have only been practicing for a few weeks , having fallen in love with fit tv 's namaste workouts , i expected the same great music , flowing rhythm , and steady pace . instead , this is an incredibly slow-moving , dull workout that does n't even challenge me , a true beginner . i adore yoga , and wanted a longer , challenging workout -- this is not it . i 'm back to my free fittv namaste workouts , until i can find somethng better
`` over done '' is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a `` stolen '' video camera .
i have been waiting to see this film for a while now . and i just finally saw it i 'm very dissapointed . this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills . the film sucks ! ! ! the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat . and get stranded on a deserted isolated island . was a great ! idea except that with this film you 're going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me . i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi 's make up looks silly . they 're not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh . the picture quality has aged even if it 's dvd format very grainy poor picture quality . i have seen other movies from the <NUM> 's on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it 's age . but this was awful . the only good thing it has was decent acting lol . like i said before this is nothing but a ( low budget cheap horror film ) rent it if you like . but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time .
judging by the long reviews before me , it should be obvious that there is much to say about calvin 's theology . this book does n't say too much . for those familiar with his theology , do n't buy this book . it will be a waste of your money . for those who would like to know more about calvin 's theology , without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology , buy this . if you want a good in depth coverage of calvin 's theology , buy the full version and enjoy
i laughed like a loon when i watched these shows as a kid . my sides hurt and tears came to my eyes . for years , i told people that that this was the best , most creative , funniest show ever aired . i tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but i never did . suddenly , i found this collection on amazon and i was in heaven . when it arrived , i ripped it open and started to watch . i fell asleep before i got through the first episode . i was crushed . nary a laugh or even a snicker on the dvd . truly disappoined after decades of waiting . sigh !
this album finds billy joel at the dawn of the superstardom to come . there are a number of songs that could very well have been hits had this album been released after he had been internationally established with the stranger and 42nd st . notably - miami <NUM> , summer highland falls , and new york state of mind are album-cut classics and are as good as anything he had written before or since . for those fans who were introduced to billy joel through just the way you are , and the rest of the stranger album , turnstiles is well worth the purchase to discover a prior album of equal weight and substance
what a load of garbage . equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime , is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed . she has no idea waht she is talking about
when i received this dvd , i played it on my imac . when doing this , i discovered that there were chinese characters showing at the top of the screen . the quality of the dvd images were dark and grainy . i reported to amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated dvd , and i was saddened to not have a response from amazon other than refunding my costs . copyright is not only a law to protect publishers ; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products . i feel that i can no longer depend on amazon to provide my dvd orders .
this book was a great book . i like the way trent was helped by nick . one thing i did n't like was the violence . i am not a big fan of basketball , or any other sport , but this book really touched me . i would recommend this book to anyone even if they are n't a lover of sports . that is what i thought about night hoops . sunny block
have you ever been stabbed in the face ? i have n't but while i was watching this movie , i had this almost overbearing curiosity to find out what its like . seriously , this movie is so bad , suicide wo n't erase the haunting visions of sheer ineptetude from your mind . this movie is probably the worst movie ever made . well , there are worse movies out there , shatter dead and <NUM> seconds being two that i can name off the top of my head , but i mean come on both movies had a combined budget of a mcchicken sandwhich with a small order of fries . whats this movies excuse
this movie was obviously made for young children , and older people will noyt understand it
wow , they actually put this `` anti-classic '' on cd . seriously , this is a very bad album . practically none of the `` superstars '' can sing , other than jimmy hart , and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs . not that they fare too well when they sing `` serious '' songs . nikolai volkoff has a decent baritone voice , but his thick accent renders `` cara mia '' unintelligible . probably the worst singing here is by roddy piper , although captain lou albano gives him a run for the money . if you are a fan of bad celebrity singing , you should get this album
when i first heard that <NUM> strings would be coming out with another album i was excited . i had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that i had high hopes for this one . the first single was amazing ! the day it came out i ran out and bought it . i must have listened to it hundreds of times , it was so good ! i could n't wait for the actual album . then it came out ... my excitement diminished . first of all , i realized that vanessa was barely on the cd . you do n't mess with a good thing ! vanessa 's voice complimented the music so well ! then a second problem arose : the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album 's music only this time with different lyrics . what happened ? ! the only relief i found in this cd was the track `` euphoric eyes . '' it 's the only track that does n't make me want my money back . ( even both versions of the title track `` turn it around '' make me angry . i advise getting the single , as it has the best version . ) so here 's my verdict : major disappointment . why , <NUM> strings ? why
getting ready to go on international assignment , i picked up a copy of this book . the author 's breathless inanities ran along the lines of ( a paraphrase ) , & quot ; wow , some british men used to wear bowler hats. & quot ; i found very little useful in this book to prepare me for the transition , and was occasionally offended by his borderlne racist generalizations . i was expecting sociology and got sleaze instead
emo noisemaking and christian themes . the two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship . face it kids this is a fad . a really pathetic fad . disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the disco scene . the same happened with hair metal and nu-metal . those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day . you will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity . as i always say in my reviews , this is trash and should be treated so accordingly . this band should take their emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity .
where should i start ... anthony quinn was incoherent and difficult to understand ... someone put him out of his misery and have him retire already .... stalone ... well the name speaks for itself ... madeline ... why oh why did you get mixed up in this project ? ? ? has your career come to an end ? ? sylvester is obviously , finally off the steriods , because in this movie , he was so thin and drawn . he hardly had any muscle mass . it did not look like him ... is he wearing a wig in this movie ? one time box-office attractions got together and made this movie . why why why ? ? ? i want my money back , i want my <NUM> minutes of my life back . g a r b a g e and jokes were very corny . stallone looked like he was sleeping half the time
this album is seriously bland . smulch in spoonfulls . i ca n't understand how jt 's record label would allow him to release music so lacking in any spirit whatsover . god only knows what encoraged me to buty it . my advice to you is keep well away
this musician , if you can call him that , should be embarrassed . if he has something to say , more people would listen if he did n't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts . i wo n't be buying this and my kids wo n't either . repulsive
ca n't say enough about this album . i got it as traditional cd several months ago , and it is , by far , the best music i 've bought all year . due the sparse selection of dvd-a , i was thrilled to see it offered here in this format . the positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging . i 've got a dedicated dvd-audio player run through a pioneer <NUM> watts per channel amp running klipsh kg 5.5 mains and comperable center , surrounds and sub . -not a totally high-end system , but it 'll hold its own . i have to say that i was disapointed when i heard the album for one reason : knopfler 's voice is <NUM> % relegated to the center channel . perhaps it 's a matter of taste , but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments . the idea of <NUM> channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any donald fagen , hotel california , but there 's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying . in my opinion , this one crosses that line . some may love it ; to me , it 's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience . -bria
my 9-year-old daughter absolutely loved the book . i thought i would get the movie for her so that she can get a visual sense of what rural life is like in america . specifically , i wanted her to see how marty 's family is rural and poor yet proud and dignified . unfortunately , none of that came through very well in the movie . in fact , the `` ruralness '' and poverty aspects did not come through at all ! also , what 's the deal with this absolutely unnecessary character named sam ? ? finally , this movie also failed to present the various ethical dilemmas that marty had to face in his attempt to rescue shiloh
i bought this album thinking that it would be good ... boy was i wrong ! ms. mcbride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them . rose garden , for example is my favorite song , and is sung by lynn anderson ... it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the rose garden as lynn was singing . marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song ... no feeling , emotions , etc . the rest of the songs sounded crummy too . save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs .
certainly not deserving of the grammy ( for cast recording ) . each of the other nominated productions is much better than this poor excuse of a revival .
`` raw ? '' `` energetic '' ? `` in your face '' ? i honstly ca n't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ism is any of those things . energy level is close to that of `` the trinity sessions '' , but this band does n't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills , for that matter - of the cowboy junkies , so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever . capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not imho improved by the very free application of reverberberberb , against a background of lethargic mush . coming soon to garage sales all over the country
professor shaw is certainly not starved for thoroughness in presenting the rise and fall of the ottoman state . but what this text boils down to is something that herman melville would have penned had he been a scholar in turkish history . piling on fact after fact after fact is not conducive to a worthwhile learning experience . you would need more than two hands to count how many times i flung this text against the wall , and i consider myself to be * very * patient . luckily , there are alternatives available . halil inalcik does a much more lucid job -- his book is the one to get
this video is broken into six 10-minute sections . who in their right mind would work out for only <NUM> minutes ? this is not going to accomplish anything . well , you think i 'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other . this is silly too , because each <NUM> minute segment includes a warmup , small workout routine , and stretches . unless it is okay with you to do all this over and over again , it is not an effective use of your time . especially if you are truly trying to accomplish a goal
the only good thing in this movie is jolene blalock as a femme fetale . the problem with this film , to paraphrase an old quote , is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it . truly only wilbur smoth knows how to pull off south african grand guignol and have you care . unfortunately wilbur smith has nothing to do with this . and it shows
this was an awful movie . the premise was an obvious rip off an outer limits episode ( straight and narrow ) , but i was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format . i was sadly disappointed . the film eliminated everything that was interesting about the outer limits episode , and instead filled itself with ... nothing . in the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the `` bad guys '' about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect . by the time the credits rolled , i was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea , when properly executed , and i do n't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers . to sum up : do n't watch this movie . it 's bad . watch the <NUM> 's outer limits episode , `` straight and narrow , '' starring ryan philippe , instead
certainly it is not to my dismay that this will be the author 's last edition . her information is all right in many ways , but useless in most . if you want drug store quality cosmetics , you can find useful ones , some very good ones . if you want very good quality cosmetics , more often you will pay for the increased quality . ms. begoun says in the intro to this ( hopefully ) final edition , that she was hired by a mall in silver spring years ago . since i grew up in the silver spring area and still live nearby , i 'd love to know what mall she 's referring to . years ago there were no malls in silver spring . a few shopping centers , but no malls . she says she had acne and saw that toners did n't close pores , etc . she 's right in many ways , but she 's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own . if you want the very best cosmetics , you will have to patronize high-end stores like nordstrom , saks fifth avenue , neiman marcus , etc . the professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin . it may take time , but all depends on what you want . ms. begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics . maybe they do n't work for her . when i look through her book , it may be cleverly written , but she does n't really know what she 's talking about . i had `` bad skin '' until i began using the erno laszlo line . i had clogged pores , pimples , dry , scaly patches . after a few months of using laszlo and continuing to now , people i do n't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is . strangers do n't comment on someone 's skin for nothing . when i see ms. begoun 's book , i always turn to the section where she rips the erno laszlo line of cosmetics . this edition , she omits what she has written in the past , that laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product . there is a reason laszlo customers are loyal . it works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life . i have used erno laszlo for almost <NUM> years and no one ever believes that i am <NUM> years old . of course i do n't look <NUM> ! but my skin is smooth , the occasional dark `` age spot '' that appears fades within a few weeks of using laszlo 's wonderful `` no . 3-9 '' . my husband is <NUM> , looks younger than <NUM> , and still everyone thinks he is older than me . my lipline is smooth , lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when i wear lipstick , which is daily . ms. begoun in this edition of the book says that erno laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot , hot water ( part of his system requires <NUM> rinses of hot water twice a day ) , but that rinsing does exfoliate and i have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause . my cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll ( laszlo works , but gravity is a very powerful force and i do n't expect to look <NUM> when i 'm <NUM> ! ) she rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but i think that 's because she has a conflict of interest . is she selling her own products ? i know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics , i did n't bother to find out if she 's still doing so . erno laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as marilyn monroe , gloria swanson , greta garbo and joan crawford - you can read in `` mommy dearest '' how crawford 's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening ! the reason erno laszlo had these clients is because his system works . it 's not cheap , it 's very expensive , but it works . most definitely , it works . last week , i was `` carded '' ! quite a compliment for a someone who 's been a mom for over <NUM> years
when britney spear 's first album came out called oops ! i did it again , i thought she had talent . but when my perogative came out , i 'm like , `` where she at ? that 's sooo not britney spears ! ! '' i could n't believe it ! ! and her music videos from the cd , uggh ! ! i want da real britney back ! ! !
should you be afraid of your microwave oven ? this book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs , before concluding that no , you probably should n't be afraid of your microwave . that embodies what 's wrong with this book . it pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas . it also assumes that you , the reader , are the mother-to-be , while having very little to say to your partner , in a way that i find subtly sexist . overall , it has plenty to make you extra-worried . for instance , it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house ( on the door , in the kitchen , on the bathroom mirror , really , all around your house ) , in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly was n't already making you worry quite enough . if you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily , `` have you fed your baby breakfast today ? '' then you may like this book . personally , i found that _what to expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful . for a book so full of information , it also , curiously , failed to address any of my specific questions . how soon should i begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins : as soon as i start trying to get pregnant , or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive ? is there anything i can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant ? what are those odds , anyway , for a woman my age ? these seemed like reasonable questions to me , but to find answers , i had to look in the far-more-helpful book by ann douglas , _the mother of all pregnancy books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that i love . the other book i highly recommend is armin brott 's _the expectant father_ , which has terrific & reasonable advice you wo n't find elsewhere . by those two , not this one .
this production is misleadingly named . far from being a biography of grand duchess anastasia , it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of russian revolutionaries in <NUM> spawned one of the 20th century 's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when , among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family , one woman began to pick up supporters in the <NUM> 's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family . i do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography . after all , how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege ? however , i do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history . and i am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of romanov history buffs about whether anna anderson was really anastasia . this work 's take on the life of anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the romanovs , their support among their subjects , and their reputation among today 's russians . first , life in the inner sanctum of nicholas 's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims . certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal . but neither nicholas nor alexandra were well-suited to their roles , and they lived under the strain of it . they were increasingly isolated from the extended romanov clan , who shared the dawning awareness of the russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble . while these forces might not have touched anastasia directly , she was certainly touched by her brother 's hemophilia and her mother 's response of sinking into frail health , chronic emotional distress , and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times . secondly , this film 's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary white army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong . while the whites wanted to unseat the bolshevik revolution , there was virtually no support for a romanov restoration among the leadership of the white army . nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family . in fact , one senior white military leader once remarked , `` having seen the monarchy at close quarters , i have no desire to see its return . '' and thirdly , while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last romanov 's reputation underway in russia today , the notion that the murdered romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims . in fact , the great masses of modern russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted romanovs back on a throne . i do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the romanovs , whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the russian monarchy 's fading years , or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives . but -- whatever the reason ( s ) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is , in fact , closer to a grocery-store romance novel
the authors of this book seem to believe that the best individual performers should become managers - that is not something that i can agree with . it is full of pompous language ( i do not want to see the word empowerment again in my whole life ) instead of real-world advice . i simultaneously bought the book first-time manager and it is much better
this vile , pretentious dump of a movie sucks joy out of your life . breillat exhibits no love for humankind . i find something to like in most movies , but breillat has made it onto my small enemies list with this one . not someone i want to be spending my time with . i think the last movie i hated as much as this was `` johnny mnemonic '' . if you do watch it , make sure you have something good on hand to wash the taste out of your mouth . i 'm going for cocteau 's beauty and the beast . singing in the rain would probably be even better . for balance , i will add that there are a couple of scenes which have some human interest to them . but mostly this is a cold , cruel , inhuman flick
let me start off by saying , i am a huge beyonce fan , and i am not in any way `` hating '' on her.i love her voice , her stage presence , her look ; i mean , the girl is bad ( in a good way ) ! now , with that said , i really expected more from her . like i 've read in so many people 's reviews , i heard 'deja vu ' and i just knew this album was gon na be off the hook . however , that was not the case . i really like the strength and fierceness of b-day ( i 'm all for female empowerment ) , but the songs seem really ... sloppy in a way.beyonce is a creative and talented songwriter , but on b-day its like she was writing for keshia cole ( a simpler , more 'urban ' style ) . not saying that she does n't appeal to the urban crowd , its just that beyonce is a little more sophisticated than what she 's showing us in b-day . dangerously in love was a better album . she had dance songs , love songs , feel-good songs ; it took you to so many places that few artists can go on an album . b-day did not do that for me . beyonce has the potential to produce a great album ; i 'm looking forward to her next project . sorry b , i still love you though
i tried the abs workout and because it 's twisting you in a weird way , i injured my tail bone . that was in february of <NUM> . since then , to this day i have pain ( similar to arthritis ) in my tailbone that gets aggravated from various activities , so i have to really watch out . i have better days and worse days . once it does get aggravated , i 'm doomed for weeks till it calms down . it 's so annoying since i 'm only <NUM> and it hurts right now even when i 'm walking ( i feel like i 'm <NUM> ) i wish i had never come across this dvd ! ! !
i 'm a massive , huge , big-time india fan . i have every release and have witnessed her powerful live performances from nyc to miami , but i must say that i 'm not feeling this cd . it sounds a bit rushed and her vocals seem to be recorded diffrently than usual , not as strong . i love the title track as well as `` cuando hieres a una mujer '' and `` no es lo mismo '' . that 's <NUM> good ones out of <NUM> songs . this from an artist that has released cd 's that you can listen to from beginning to end . i do n't even know what to say about `` madre e hija aka madre '' , although i think the sentiment is sweet , it 's comes across corny . now that we 've lost celia , i was hoping that she would raise the bar a bit and drop an unique , beautilfully produced cd . i figured she would snatch salsa back from reggaeton and create a classic in the vein of ms. cruz . i 'm a bit dissapointed that she 's still singing about lost love and scorned lovers . i thought after her great sony release `` mi alma y mi corazon '' we 'd get amazing material ...... and what happened with sony anyway ? ? ? now she 's with univision ? ! ? ! india-i still admire you and i 'll always support your work ..... spoken like a true fan .
here , in all their glory , is rem : the undisputed pied pipers of the bedwetters . while michael stipe 's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a german stuka dive-bomber , the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere . in rem , we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying . the embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in <NUM> , but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate . this album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift
matter of life and death is much better . brave new world is lame progressive rock not heavy metal . they do n't even do a good job at making progressive rock either . check out therion , iced earth , or dream theater instead .
although you get alot of songs for $ <NUM> , you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from mos in the past two years . the best songs are from the album that features hits from the past . you ca n't really go wrong there . you 'd be better downloading the <NUM> good songs from itunes and saving $ <NUM>
i was so disappointed when i heard this cd . the background music overpowers allisons voice . if i had heard this before i bought it , i would have passed on it . i ca n't say anything good about it . thanks ov
this was a complete waste . walken is good , but god what a waste ! i never finished strieber 's first book which had intrigued me . but in succeeding books , he does nothing to prove anything . he gives a tale of experience that borders on religion . this horrible , suspenseless , and cheap film gives nothing to redeem strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke . maybe i should n't be so harsh on it . after all i 'm not a ufo reasercher or whatnot . but i 'm still human . i still have opinions . and my opinion of this is , yuck
the remix sucks . do n't even buy the whole remixes on itunes , they really are bad . i will write reviews for their other remixes . nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment . the title is the nato phoetic alphabet , your stupid piece of _____ . once again , you have no idea what you are talking about . becuase your stupid . tell me , could you write a song like this ? your respone will be : no , but it 's stupid anyway ! or , yes ! no , no you could n't . _____ off , your reasons on your pathetic reivew for hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are . the people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the bhg haters are
drew 's famous party music is a joke . i wish i had read the reviews before i purchased this cd . in the past <NUM> weeks , i have probably ordered <NUM> or <NUM> compilation cd 's looking for great music from the 70s , 80s and <NUM> 's for a party i am hosting . i read the reviews for the other cd 's and they were great , but in my excitement about finding whoomp there it is and love train , i did n't check the reviews for this cd . this cd is not at all what i thought it would be . trust me , this is not the one , it 's not even on the list . i was looking for whoomp there it is , and especially love train by the ojays . not what i got . i excitedly listened to whoomp , and i kept saying this does n't sound right . something sounds like its missing from the song . so i listened to love train , and immediately , i knew that it was not the ojays singing . i realized that none of the original artists were singing . this is a terrible misrepresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i listened to the cd before i played it at the party . i would have been horrified . i wish i could give it less than one star and get a refund . please , please , please do n't waste your money
i saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also . i was very wrong . the movie is awfu
this film is unwatchable -- and the only question is what talented actors like colin firth and minnie driver are doing in this insipid hack job . when it comes to dialogue , not a single word rings true . none of the characters make any sense at all . they are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull , and so ridiculously unbelievable , that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words , rather than a cognizant human being . we could n't get through it , as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about . i see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end . it 's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey
i , like many others , wanted to like this cd , but was really disappointed . a lot of work obviously went into the creation of this . they have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable . i thought the first song was decent enough , but after that the cd spirals downward fast . the main problem , as many reviewers have noted , is the singers voice , which is often hard to hear . but if i had a voice like his , i 'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix . the most original thing about this cd was the liner notes/lyrics , which are presented in the form of a funeral program . get it ? cool , huh ?
if you are that `` dummy '' who wants to know how to build a web-site , then this is not the book for you . it tells you hardly how to build , it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool . you have to have some html cq dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify . by reading the book and going through the enclosed cd rom with ty-out software , i soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading . see comments above why . if you are that `` dummy '' who has not a single thread of knowledge about building web-sites , then do not buy this book . not giving it <NUM> star ( but i was close ) , there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude , but typing what you want to have inside your web-site ( links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around <NUM> % of the book ) . you will get the same information from any search engine . recommendation : concentrate first on a book , that teaches you the basic html-programming language , continue then with either a dreamweaver/frontpage manual . you 're much better off ..
this book is very out dated ! ! it is a history of the v6 engine up to the early <NUM> 's . look for a more up to date book
i bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information . i was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small . also , the book is hard to navigate . the hard cover and hard binding do n't allow for anyone to write it in it ( inflexible ) . i gave it as a gift still , but i had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was
i read this after enjoying iles ' `` footprints of god '' quite a bit . this is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise . the book is lengthy , and repeats itself quite a bit ( due , i assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters ) . several characters could 've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed , but did n't add anything to the story . intriguing characters , too - he could 've saved them for their own stories . after wanting to get to the end for the last <NUM> pages , i found the ending itself rushed . all loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that did n't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far . there were some aggravating teases , too . when the israeli finally gets to confront the nazi for the question of `` why ? '' ( regarding the anti-semitism ) , i was really hoping that iles would 've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate . nope - he put the question out there and did n't try to answer it . that 's what i was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it 's manifested . all that being said , the last page of the epilogue is brilliant , and in it , i found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord .
this a great priced cd , but the content is why it is so cheap . it 's a true-amateur album . beethoven lover is over her/his head . this is the real world , not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world . deal with it and agree with me . it is n't so great
... but every song on the album sounds the same . and i happen to like them . disappointed
i do n't know what is up with the entrepreneur-magazine series of books , but i 've read several of them now and i 've yet to be impressed with any of them . the best way to describe this book ... bland and full of fluff . most of them are apparently written by people who have no real-world business experience . they are not recommended
you 'd think the qualifications for writing a delphi book would be <NUM> ) you must be a delphi expert <NUM> ) you must write well . well , i can tell you for sure that this guy does n't meet either qualification . this is , without question , the worst programming book i have ever had the misfortune to buy . ayres writes like a third grader . and the code is even worse . a person who 'd never seen delphi before could write this code . it is mostly warmed over msdn example code converted to pascal . frankly , i 'd be embarrassed to publish something like this . it 's that bad
at the end of this film gene hackman 's character , strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle , finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug . this scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener . hackman plays harry caul , a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field . he gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film . more interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life . he staunchly defends privacy , even though it is his job to invade it . he refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him . i know that today it is very fashionable to criticize bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on . the chilling affect we watch take place in the world of harry caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today . simply because you are aware of bush 's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone . harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness , and while that may not be healthy i 'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way . while there are lessons here that deal with living in bush 's america , this still is n't a very good film . this is a much smaller scale than coppola usually deals with and it does n't seem to be a very good fit for him . the script was original and unpredictable . however , it was also slow and filled with nonsense . i watched the film twice and still do n't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end . also , the scene in which we visit harry 's twisted dream was a total miss for me . the purpose was to show just had mad he had gone . to me it looked like coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film . hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre- '' unforgiven . '' a dashing harrison ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten . still , this film falls flat . most of the film involves harry trying to figure out the entire conversation . the tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know big brother is using today . i liked the way this film reminded me of `` rear window . '' as in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him . it is a theme that affects us in our daily lives . every story we hear has holes and lies in it . we have to fill those holes and sort out the bs to come to a perceived reality . but what if we 're wrong ? nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel . if for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas . then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant , and whether your ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug . * * 1/2
this book is filled with silly photographs , many of which are degrading to the dignity of animals , with a line or two on each page about & quot ; the greatness of being a mom & quot ; from a male author who is n't even a parent ? ? ! ! give me a break . i 'm returning this
i am a big u2 fan and i do n't really like this . there are a couple really good songs on it but other than that ... not for the average listener
i admit , i have n't finished this book . a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia . i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards , interest in astrology and angels . granted , i am not a firm believer in just `` the hard facts '' but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !
i am a long time k.t . fan . i saw this show on pbs years ago so i bought the tape . the show was severly edited ( about an hour ) and the audio was poor . it is , however , the last chance to see dave guard and roger gamble , therefore it is a must
and when did n't buy a new edition and i got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls , i got published . i know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition . all i can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily , thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has ( lol ) , but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track . this book wo n't help you do it
i purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children . i liked the story but the chapters were way too long . my children kept asking , `` how many more pages ? ''
sometimes i 've enjoyed books by david baldacci ( wish you well and the winner come to mind ) ; others , such as the last man standing did little for me . . . add split second , which i just heard , to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced secret service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . i cared little about any of the characters , and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also did n't do much for me , as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly , i did not particularly `` buy '' the man behind the crimes ; he just was n't all that believable .
on april <NUM> , <NUM> , this collection was re-released as part of the universal music gold collection , at a much lower price ( in canada , anyway ) . the material and mastering are fantastic , worthy of <NUM> stars , but the price , when compared to gold , made me give the anthology just one star
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction . if thoughts are that powerful , they need to be resrained earlier . i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive . logic can be quite painful when left alone , but sometimes it has to be
saw this movie once & do n't want to see it again . jim carrey , before getting more mature roles in `` man in the moon '' , '' eternal sunshine '' & '' truman show '' , indulges in endless slapstick , gets plenty of gross-out humor , beds courtney cox ( before `` friends '' , david arquette & baby coco ) & finds out oh ! the horror ! the horror ! he 's kissed a man.since this was before `` brokeback '' & heath & jake won their best kiss from the mtv movie awards , jim goes through an elaborate `` purification '' ceremony . it relies on gags ; this is n't a great movie.it ranks with `` wild wild west '' as one of the worst.do yourself a favor & avoid this movie
this cd was supposed to expose a new side of dar willams , it has failed to do this . the lyrics , and songs are repetitive of previous works . i would suggest buying something else
this book is a rehash of stuff that has already been said about this product . it is clear that the author did not close transactions but viewed credit derivatives as an academic . nothing new is said . he could at least have written in an original fashion but decided to write about already exposed concepts in a very dry manner .
first of all , for the caliber of actors in this movie , they deserved a better script . michelle pfeifer and peter gallagher are class acts , but really this movie just did not dig deep enough . i have read all the rave reviews of claire danes , as i have read all the raves in the past and i am beside myself . i mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee . if this is her niche , so be it . the premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on . completely understandable . then his annoying sister in law and her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead . oh my god , stop the presses . these people had the sensitivity of androids . it would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house , but then the film would'nt drone on and on , this is a good film for a rainy day . but i expected more
back in the <NUM> 's shinya tsukamoto burst onto the scene with the explosive tetsuo the iron man and the riveting study of ultraviolence tokyo fist.over the years his films have become more coherant but also less interesting.vital retains a little of his visual energy though unfortunately the story about a man with amnesia who discovers he 's dissecting his lost love at a college is n't very compelling.there are some nice dream sequences but the film lacks the energy and sheer creative force of tsukamoto 's earlier films
other than the genuinely great remix of atomic by diddy , the remixes here are highly forgetable . most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck . avoid
dem franchize boyz drifted around the atl music scene and dropped a number of independent releases , but then their song `` white tee '' , while not necessarily becoming a major hit by billboard standards , did give them some brief attention . but that 's nothing compared to the popularity they 've received thanks to their latest album , on top of our game . i personally do n't see what the big deal is about this album . before i listened to it , i thought i would be annoyed by all the snap music , but it turns out that the problem is n't necessarily the music itself , but the below-average lyrics that all four members of dem franchize boyz put on wax . i never was that impressed by `` i think they like me '' ( an obvious single because it 's censored ) , but the thing is , that 's actually the best song on the album . many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter , like cars ( `` ridin ' rims '' ) , bling-blingin ' ( `` you know what it is '' ) , and hardcore sex ( `` freaky as she wan na be '' -- and why does trey songz keep wasting his talent like this ? ) . the choruses can get a little uncreative too : `` do n't play with me '' has `` b , do n't play with me '' while `` stop callin ' me '' has `` b , stop callin ' me '' ( by the way , calling the latter song wack would be an understatement ) . and `` they do n't like that '' makes me wonder if they were reading our minds . the production also tends to get repetitive ; when i heard `` suckas come and try me '' , i felt like singing : `` i think i think they like me ! '' and the remix of `` white tee '' is unnecessary , especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here . i 'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that d4l and dem franchize boyz are the same group . the only thing more annoying than the group 's rapping is when damon dash shows up on `` bricks <NUM> the high '' . no , he is n't rapping ; he 's instead talking -- no , not talking ; whining about severed ties with jay-z and roc-a-fella ( * sigh * ... is he still talking about that ? ) . in the end , while i would n't call this the worst so so def album ever ( young , fly & flashy vol . <NUM> gets that honor ) , it 's pretty darn close . if this is dem franchize boyz at the top of their game , what does rock bottom look like ? anthony ruper
all this information is on the internet or available from your doctor . after many years of struggling with hip pain the water exercises are no surprise . nothing in the book is new . i was very disappointed , if i could do the exercises listed , i would n't need the book . good luck to all of you , go to the local y or swim therapy , put the money to good use for a good therapist , hips are not do it yourself
ok , i bought this cd and it gets <NUM> stars one each for the songs `` believe '' and `` i 'm building bridges '' . the other songs are horrible . ronnie is the lead vocalist for a very good reason ! they were very smart to get vince gill ( the best ! ) to do background vocals on bridge 's . save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale !
the music sounds like generic oldschool eurobeats which is fine . but the vocals are terrible . he sounds like the biggest fag in the world . they 're even worse than eiffel <NUM>
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival , and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is [ ... ] . the whole cast is wasted in this movie , and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better . like pretty much the leads in this movies , i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in , but this one , they might as well . if your a tim allen fan , please do yourself a favor , and get either the santa clause movies , or the toy story movies , and avoid this movie at all costs . here are <NUM> minuts of my life , that i wo n't see again , and i am trying to make sure that you do n't waste your time on this dud . who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog , in some scenes in the movie , ore pretty much the whole thing . i have n't seen monster house or cars , but i hope that these will be <NUM> better movies , or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this . dave douglas ( tim allen ) is a lawyer , that dislikes dogs , and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester ( joshua leonard ) . and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant & strictland . and he does n't much of a family life , since he is never home , and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie ? his wife is rebecca douglas ( kristin davis ) and they have <NUM> children josh ( spencer breslin ) and carly ( zena grey ) . and he has an appoontment to josh 's pta meetings , and even through he is reminded at work , he forgets . carly is not only a is both forrester 's student and a budding animal advocate herself , and her brother is trying out for football like his dad , even through he secretly hates it , and did n't sign up for the fall musical . and then there is a mad scientist ( robert downey jr. ) , trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery . and carly even kidnaps it from grant & strictland , and brings him home , nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas , that gets him starting acting like a dog too , and even looking exactly like him at times . the movie expects us to believe the dog is <NUM> years old , which would be impossible , since neither dogs or people live that long , all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes , and this is one to avoid at all costs .
i regret buying this cd even though it just a buck i did n't like it at all the girl or whatever she is do n't know how to sing at all sounds like she is whinning do n't buy it i know what i am saying i am a trip hop fan and check out soma sonic /future thats real musi
this book missed a great opportunity to educate young women about the health risks involved in being sexually active . the author advises living together before marriage but devotes only a few woefully inadequate paragraphs to educating young women about protection from sexually transmitted diseases . worse yet , the information provided is dangerously incomplete and incorrect , putting the health of young women readers at risk . this book fails to give young women the tools they need to be proactive in protecting their health above all else . surviving your twenties safely is more critical than surviving your twenties with style
who remastered it ? it sure was n't bob ; find the unremastered cd if you can . or better yet , - the original lp is absolutely amazing . this remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is `` new and improved '' when it is neither . for the best experience in appreciating bob marley and what he accomplished , read a biography , then listen to all the original albums . here are some of my favorite bob marley songs that are not usually on any best list : heathen , small axe , who the cap fit , war , get up stand up , johnny was , duppy conqueror , cry to me , one foundation . if i was forced to pick his best song it would probably be `` war . '' even though he did n't write the words and it is largely spoken , it is extremely powerful
as a new bride , i thought this book was -- well -- let 's say -- -boring ! . no style .. no design and these authors are `` lost '' as far as what brides want in the 21st century . if you are young , hip and cool , this book is not for you . if you are old on a 4th marriage , you might like it . also-warning .. these authors have terrible reviews on their baby bargains book . it seems they write all their own great reviews . i think martha stewart weddings is obviously much better and i also think i would not recommend a book from denise and alan field 's ever
remember when green day was hot back in <NUM> , and in the years to come , a million and one soundalikes would come along ? well , it 's happening again , this time with the band fall out boy . fall out boy got huge around <NUM> when their hit single `` grand theft autumn '' exploded onto the music scene and put `` take this to your grave '' on everyone 's `` amazon favorite list '' . in <NUM> , the band signed with major-label `` island '' , and has proved to be one of the labels most successful acts . weeks on end with number <NUM> singles , thousands of records sold ( millions of downloads ) and a massive following could only bring one thing ; the clones . june is `` victory records '' first attempt to cash in on fall out boy mania , with a manic post-punk sound and stump-esque vocals . although they are n't exactly a carbon-copy , the influence is too blatant , and that alone makes it highly passable . nothing new here folks , just fall out boy on a smaller scale . on a quick side-note , victory has just released another record from a band called `` the audition '' . this band sounds even more like fall out boy , and their instant popularity means that june will probably have to take the backseat for a little while . get something more original instead ...
i enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries ; however , this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above . the writing is n't great , the descriptions certainly do n't transport you to tuscany , and despite the title , i would n't say there is an emphasis on food . if you were related to patrizia , you mind find it an interesting read , but i 've found myself skimming through it , searching for compelling passages , of which there are few
i do enjoy the first ep 's and the albums from these guys , however , this cd kinda landed way off the mark . the greatness of the past cds were the energy along with the catchy street punk sing-a-long songs . on this album the unseend didnt seem to give it much time and effort . even a new version of one of there old songs couldnt save this from being a flop . sorry guy
i returned this product to you as it was all in spainish . it was n't asvertized as so . all other purchases i 've made from you get <NUM> stars ! i 'm a very satisfied customer
why prior books that are far better researched have the lifespan of milk , while goldberg who 's story is surely contrived , gets five star reviews . seems like working at the new yorker and washington post trumps ... danny rubenstein 's `` the people of nowhere '' amira hass ' `` drinking the sea at gaza '' and wendy orange ' `` coming home to jerusalem '' ... and many others who were deeply engaged journalists drop off the book list . surely these now out of print books covered the same turf but none are connected to goldberg 's . why ? is it all about connections and pr ? i think yes . what do you think ?
we are in the logistics business and i reviewed this book as a potential teaching tool for management . the book is unfortunatley of little to no value . most concerning is that the mathematics for inventory management , a critical factor in understanding logistics , are simply wrong . even a quick look by anyone familiar with inventory management would find this concerning .
some peopel may find this book useful . i am just begining to learn the apa format and i did not find this book to be user friendly . i have had better information given to me from handouts from other books
this is truly one the most spectacular films ever made , not suffering for having been made during the silent era . however , as correctly stated by another review of the film , the dvd version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the vhs 155mins . this is not due to dvd faster frame rate , but rather because the dvd version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason . at one point , the hero ( fairbanks ) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree , the next minute he is seen explaining to her ( in an intimate scene ) that he is not what he seems . having seen the vhs a number of times , i can confirm that the dvd version has been brutally cut . do not buy the dvd version , as it is a let-down with those scenes missing ; thus the reason for my one star , which would otherwise have been <NUM> 1/5 ( <NUM> stars with the rimsky korsakov soundtrack ) . you have been warned
damn yankees was a supergroup containing ted nugent , tommy shaw ( styx ) , jack blades ( nightranger ) and someother guy . all talented musicians , who are best heard in their prespective groups . damn yankees just does n't rock , like it should . i 've given it a chance and just ca n't get into it . a lot of talent involved , just does n't do anything for me
this book has no useful information in it . the pictures are pretty , but i do n't spend good money on a book just to look at the pictures . even the ideas are n't all that creative . if i had cupboards full of antiques and drawers full of beautiful linens , i would n't need a book to tell me how to use them . other , better books show the same techniques and ideas , and show them with materials more easily available to us mere mortals . the example that really did me in was the little girl 's birthday party ... with crocheted lace doilies on the drinks glasses , and all the little girls in edwardian-style lace dresses . please ! you want an example of a pretty child 's birthday party , get the shabby chic entertaining book
let me start by saying that i thought that atmosphere 's early albums were much better ( most of atmosphere 's current fans have no idea that they had other albums ... ) but seven 's travels is slug and ant 's transformation into a crappy sell-out group , and the first ever emo-rap group . the people that love this album are always some teenager , usually some emo-kid , who decide they like rap and atmosphere after hearing this album . they jump onto the official atmosphere bandwagon , but dont think that they listen to rap ... they listen to `` rap '' . these emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better atmosphere is , and how underground is the best . ( dont think from this that i am a fan of mainstream rap , i 'm just explaining ) the number one sign you can tell from , even by just looking at these reviews , is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks ( naturally , these teenage kids like to be different , and ca n't stop talking about it ) or how this is real true rap music . so , basically , these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only atmosphere album they 've ever heard , sevens travels and live out their little emo lives listening to atmosphere ( for about <NUM> months ) . even if these people listen to atmosphere 's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate atmosphere super-fan ! ) it makes no difference because atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now . the purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for emotionally-disturbed teenagers . go buy some real hip-hop , and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to sevens travels
major disappointment . maynard 's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his band-mates into this pile of dung just because he can . not only was this album/dvd completely rushed and way less-than-perfected , i found it odd that in a chat with maynard on october <NUM> , <NUM> he stated the following regarding the 13th step , `` i 'm not thinking about that right now . i 'm on the delivery table crowning ... breathing hard ... delivering my new baby ... and you 're asking me if i 'm going to have another baby someday '' . but yet emotive was rushed to be released in time for <NUM> elections . maybe mr. keenan should heed his own advice : `` you are always responsible for your own actions , so choose them wisely '' .
did not like this album at all . poorly written and musically a failure . no wonder this guy trashes other artists
i 've read some of the braun series cat books and this one was n't one of my favorites . it was boring with no plot and it did mention very little about the butterfly girl or who she is . the story did n't make any sense at all . i could n't get into this one . i read it but was disappointed in it . i 'm lucky that i only paid $ <NUM> for it towards charity
i was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on dj quik 's rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about <NUM> years past the pull date on style.up 'n da club is tight.straight up dj quik is a musical genius.but he ca n't pull this disc off properly.amg is banging on the track but overall it 's missing something
irvin matus wrote the definitively researched text on shakespearean authorship ( shakespeare , in fact ) , and the earl of oxford fails completely as an alternative bard . i would n't go around quoting anderson 's theories in the presence of anyone familiar with matus ' evidence . you 'll get your head handed to you on a platter . guaranteed . it wo n't be a fair fight

musical scores were on spot , rich and compelling , imparting emotional punch ! chemistry was somewhat skewed between kidman and enman . the rule of `` show do n't tell '' was broken periodically throughout dialogue , particuarly in enman 's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene `` announcing '' to each one he meets he 's in love . scenes were pleasantly varied , many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters , however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained . it seems as though this movie tried to do `` too much '' and as a result the plot became vexed with business . a cornicopia of scene effects , ranging from surreal , to tragic , to tongue in cheek , to implausible ( with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre ? ) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest , although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks . speaking of implausible - the friendship that ensued between the red-haired minister and enman , in light of their initial conflict , seemed rather far fetched and silly , moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times . renee ' zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in jerry macguire . nicole kidman was not in her element , yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present . this film was over-starred and substantially miscast . did n't need donald as kidman 's father and kidman and zellwegger 's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary . overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault . undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved .
i know that it takes talent to make music , and i hate to criticize any musicians because i certainly could n't do it , but this cd was just not that good . there are some cool beats , but they 're pretty forgettable . lyrics in electronic music are n't always deep or anything , but in some cases , i think she actually was trying to make a & quot ; real song & quot ; , so it was kind of sad . her vocals are madonna-esque , without the smooth production . maybe she just did n't quite live up to the hype . i 'm beginning to think that most female djs & quot ; make it & quot ; just because of the novelty of female djs . there was nothing to hate , but there certainly was n't anything to love , either
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped <NUM> million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''
it 's just one of those things you end up watching at <NUM> in the morning . but skip this one . you should be sleeping . i am a die-hard strokes fan so when new york stories came out , i had to have it . much to my disappointment , it turned out to contain no music by the strokes , or interviews with any members of the band . if you still feel like you need to see this dvd , do n't pay more than $ <NUM> for it . you have been officially warned
i would like to thank all of you here for alerting me ( us ) to the fact that these episodes are not in their original state and not in order . i love b & b , however , the more i love something the more i insist it is an original . will pass until a release with integrity comes along
mr.warren seems to have trouble focusing on the subject matter in the first half of this book , making it seem to be merely a digest of fantasy and science fiction . i guess one can enjoy this book if you are open minded , very open minded . there are however more serious and factual findings on this subject for the more serious ufo fans . if you must buy the book , save your cash and buy the paperback
i am a cary grant fan , but i was extremely let down with this one . the storyline itself is funny , but not the antics . to sum it up , i found it slow moving and dull
as a white man , this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it . if an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published ! i am tired of the double standard ! thank god i did n't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library
i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer . rest of music is very date

the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw . i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand . the reason i did n't like it was because it was challenging for me . the english was hard to understand . i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books . this book was more like an opera with out music . if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book . one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war , but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war . if you 're an older audience it would be a good book , or if you 're looking for a good love-war story .
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
my kids and i have much enjoyed this recording , but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled . moreover , the narrator speaks with a british accent , making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones . in general , i have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings , so i 'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music
wished i had n't spent that amazon gift certificate on this one . this sure as hell ai n't the rock n ' roll of their other albums , which i suppose it 's not meant to be . i 'm going to pretend that this album never happened and hope that their next release blows the top off the bubbly .
i 'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of john le carre for quite some time , so i picked up the constant gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but . and while i do n't know if this is typical of the lecarre spy novels , i certainly hope not . the plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy . it 's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start . further , it 's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations ( in this case , pharmaceutical ) that are more powerful than governments . again , a device that immediately evokes common interests with me , an unabashed liberal . unfortunately that 's where the book and i part ways . justin , the minor diplomat in nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife 's rape and murder . tessa differed from justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist , while he was content to follow orders , but say and believe the right things sans effort . this , i believe is the theme of the work , that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power . good theme , but . . . the execution was poor . pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions did n't meet the set-up . as well , justin 's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail , not the most interesting tools of the thriller game . but we , as well as the character , examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep . justin is such a luddite that we , as the reader , are forced to learn about computers , emails , and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . lecarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor , because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely . bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist , an interesting irony done uninterestingly . this is n't to say that lecarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident . i 'm going to try another of his novels just because i believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it . another problem was that he telegraphed the plot . the only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was justin himself . while this can work , showing the reader what the protagonist ca n't see ( see fight club ) , in this case it 's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man . in summary , i did n't care about characters and i lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived . i ca n't recommend it . - cv ric
this dvd was probably the stupidest thing i have ever watched . there is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production . the water crystals are pretty ; - ) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense
i recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when i sat down to read it . the subtitle is & quot ; games & amp ; puzzles to stimulate your creativity & amp ; imagination & quot ; . actually , there are only some thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts ' . however , my biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy . the very first puzzle ( p. <NUM> ) has a mistake in it . then in 'mental counting ' ( p. <NUM> ) , the author claims that the letters o and u are not symmetrical about the vertical axis . as for 'three-dimesional dots ' ( p. <NUM> ) the text states & quot ; below is a collection of random dots. & quot ; unfortunately , the random dots have been omitted . so much for & quot ; something remarkable & quot ; happening as the author claims . and how 's this for one of the three ( yup , only three ) lateral thinking puzzles ? what common word begins with is , ends with nd , and has la in the middle ? i bet that really stretched your brain , did n't it ? sorry , but mr. wujec 's editor should be fired . these glaring mistakes and omissions have scuttled any enjoyment i may have expected from this book . i suspect the author was motivated by the commercial success of his previous book . he should have waited until he had something of value before publishing this schlock
so you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about hemingway 's ghost and you 're ready to drop some cash , right ? guess what -- there 's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book ! in addition , old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic 's version of handel 's halleluja chorus . instead , what 's offered here is a rehash of old stories ( and old theories about what ghosts could be ) with insipid , comic book illustrations . why this is called a & quot ; field guide & quot ; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon -- be it birds , plants , or mushrooms -- is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists . if you 're a serious researcher of this subject , then pass this book up and seek hem 's fetch elsewhere
i expected alot more from the cd ! i expected more or what creedance clearwater revival was .... the songs on the cd were n't the best & the quality of the cd was only average.this is not worth the time or the money ! and i 'm a big fan of <NUM> 's rock ! ! try buffalo springfield , or crosby , still , nash & young or janis joplin with big brother & the holding co. and the old stand by 's : beatles & stones ! ! long live rock & roll !
britain , circa <NUM> . tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes . and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public . this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing . to be fair , the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is . rather , they are appealing and prove to be the film 's lone redeeming factor . the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what `` a hard days ' night '' did for the beatles . whereas the fab four 's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it 's trying to say about the spice craze . i was reminded more of the monkees ' `` head '' than i was of `` a hard days ' night '' . lots of celeb cameos ( roger moore , elton john , et al ) that amount to naught . oh , well . on to `` from justin to kelly ''
i wanted to teach my son to program and chose vb and this book . this book really `` looks '' great but i 'm not impressed by the content . so much so that it compelled me to write my first ever book review . the introduction `` who is this book for ? '' gives a sense that this book can get people into programming . i would be amazed however if anyone not familiar with programming will get past chapter <NUM> without being frightened by the whole prospect of programming . chapter <NUM> initially jumps into some microsoft marketing of .net which really adds nothing but confuses the readers by having to deal with line after line of computer jargon . then the chapter gives a horrible overview of object orientation which again does n't help later . i feel the whole book is like the first chapter . does n't give you some of the basics but rambles about more complex stuff you do n't need between some hands on practical stuff . i actually thought the first example was really poor also . i am of the opinion that someone typing something in themselves and seeing it work should be rewarding . the example however was hard for a novice as it had long lines of comments and the line to print the variables was a minefield of quotes and symbols making it pretty likely that a beginner would do a typo . the title of the book is `` build a program now ! '' . this the book does and given how complex setting up an environment it is helpful . but i 've slammed the rating of this book because this could have covered with a lot less pages and maybe substitute some of the drivel with a little about the syntax of vb or even some explanation of the example code . do n't buy this book if you think it will teach you anything about computing or programming . do buy this book if you have some other teaching reference for visual basic and want something that will help you setup your build environment . also comes with a vb express cd so you do n't have to downloaded it .
this dvd first caught my eye with high expectations and a low price . the price turned out to be too much . stan lee and john buscema are two of the greatest comic book creators that have ever lived , but this dvd just is n't good enough to meet their standards . it offers much in the way of comic book jargon , but displays each business element very poorly . the main focus of this `` visual '' video is verbal instruction . there is a very limited amount of important hands-on drawing , barely even enough to teach a learning artist anything . i think that how to draw comics the marvel way could have been done a lot better and should offer a great deal more . unless you are an avid comic book fan , i do not recommend purchasing this dvd . and , even if you are , i would give it some serious thought
i hate to leave such a negative review , but it seems all this author did was take the information presented in `` the e-myth '' by michael gerber , and make it her own ( and in an amateurish way to boot ! ) . if you are a business owner who really wants to learn how to create systems so your company runs without you , then get the latest edition of `` the e-myth revisited '' and let a true pro show you the way
`` the fog '' is a fairly typical representative of a john carpenter movie . it certainly has its moments , yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of `` what might have been . '' in this sense it reminds me a bit of michael mann 's <NUM> version of f. paul wilson 's `` the keep '' , another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good . stripped to the bone , `` the fog '' is the story of a small new england fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial ( or bicentennial .... or anniversary of some type ) . on the eve of this occasion the local priest , a drunken sot played by hal holbrook , discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding . this discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake , and is moving towards the town . various characters in the town , including a local beer-guzzler ( tom atkins ) a nubile hitch-hiker ( jamie lee curtis ) a radio deejay ( adrienne barbeau ) and so on , are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it , and how it is related to the `` terrible secret '' , an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay . as you can see , while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool , and when i popped `` the fog '' into my ancient dvd player recently i did so after a hiatus of many years , with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong . in this i was disappointed . like `` the keep '' , `` the fog '' never gets any better ; unlike `` the keep '' it actually gets worse . on paper this should not have happened . besides carpenter , who was coming off well-received efforts like `` assault on precinct <NUM> '' and `` halloween '' there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original `` halloween '' crew . besides carptenter and jamie lee curtis , there is also the girl who played annie ( michael 's first onscreen victim ) , as well as the guy who played the sheriff in both h and h-2 . replacing the ubiquitous donald pleasance is hal halbrook , and the venerable john houseman makes an appearance in the film 's opening as a creepy , storytellin ' sea captain . even janet leigh is involved , as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a fog victim . ironically , tis is part of the film 's problem , and it has many . first off , there are far too many characters . the film is cluttered with them and for some reason carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses . most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot , and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end . we needed more killings , not less . second , the performances . this movie has good actors , but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid . the worst of it is ladeled onto adrienne barbeau , who gets to repeat idiocies like , `` my son is trapped ! trapped by the fog ! '' and `` look out , into the darkness .... and beware of the fog ! '' gag . third , the villain ( s ) . carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film , but he never delivers on it : there is no real payoff . this is because he could n't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was in the fog was the actual `` baddie '' of the film . the result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges . `` the fog '' might as well be a run o ' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal . the movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening , the moments of atmospheric horror at sea , and the excellent cinematography , which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers . but in the end these fail to outweigh the movie 's many flaws . as of today , i still regard carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there . on the one hand he gave us p-13 , halloween , escape from new york , and the thing , all classics ( cult or otherwise ) . on the other hand he also gave us crap like prince of darkness and the unwatchable ghosts of mars . in between there are the fun but flawed outings like they live and in the mouth of madness . i would like to say that the fog falls in this last category , but i really ca n't . it just is n't very good , and that 's the sad fact of it . bottom line ? beware the fog .
seriousdo n't expect much from this dvd spiderwowan : <NUM> stars crevices : <NUM> stars the sacrifice : <NUM> stars blonde kwaidan : -5 stars ( negative ) presentiment- <NUM> star the spiderwoman was just weird . like low-budget sci-fi . it lacks an actual plot . * '' crevices '' , although short , was really creepy- i think that some of the others could have been taken out to add on to this one . `` the sacrifice '' -was pretty pointless too . you know someone will die , none of the characters will call the police or try and solve this - it just plays out . frusterating to watch . the lead actress however saves this with above average acting . blonde swaidan - terrible . it 's a few minutes long and makes no sense . an obsession with blondes -finding a blonde body . how did this make it in ? ? `` presentiment '' -a weird kind of `` final destination '' /yogen type of idea here , but it just goes too slow and becomes annoying . by the time you know what 's going on , you do n't care . in summary , `` crevices '' is a scary little short <NUM> stars , and the acting in `` the sacrifice '' was great , although there was no common sense - do n't know how to score that ...
this is as bad as the film.in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula.will & amp ; his movies & amp ; music never change the same old beat.the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad.unoriginal & amp ; boring.what a waste of kool moe dee
one of the curiosities of shakespeare 's `` julius caesar '' is that the main character is not `` julius caesar '' , who is killed early in the play , nor marc antony , who has by far the best and most famous speech - `` friends , romans , countrymen , ... '' . the central character is brutus , the `` noblest roman of them all '' , who must balance his his duty toward rome against his loyalty to caesar . brutus is a follower of the stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals , rather than being lead by his emotions . it seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having jason robards , a highly skilled actor , deliver all brutus 's lines in a bored flat undertone . i wonder how they persuaded him to do it ? `` do n't act jason . trust us . just read the lines off slowly like you never saw them before and you do n't care a pin . it 'll be great. ! '' to say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement . mr. spock has a wider emotional range . they would have done better and saved money by having brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the hal <NUM> . when brutus is off screen the movie is fine . heston is surprisingly good . gielgud is great . it is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes , the cheap sets , the worst fake beard in the history of cinema . if you want to see a much better film version , there is the classic black and white version in whcih james mason and sir john gielgud make a superb pair as brutus and casius , and marlon brando gives a chilling antony . as for this one , if someone gives it to you as a present , by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library
burglar is your typical d movie . it has more bads than goods . actually , it has a ton of bads . when i sat down to watch this film , i did n't expect oscar worthy material . but , i did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest . i did n't get either of them . yes , the acting was all right . whoopie goldberg is a great comedic actress , but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in . burglar moved at a snails pace , and that is putting it lightly . there were way too many coincidences . there would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around , or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen . also , the directing was terrible . the director did not explain things well at all . the only reason i stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right . and of course , i was right . the plot was paper-thin . i do n't like a movie when i know the ending a quarter into the film . overall , burglar is a definite waste of time that now has the title of & quot ; most predictable movie ever. & quot ; <NUM> sta
i did n't think chicken run was that great . yes , i 'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters , and i 'm aware of its overwhelming popularity , but the movie did n't do a whole lot for me . i think the main problem is that the chickens have an english accent , making it hard to understand them . the film was also very dark and hard to see what was happening ( no , it was n't my television ) . the claymation is nice , but that 's the only thing the movie had going for it
walt whitman 's life 's work is his `` leaves of grass '' , enlarged over the years with additional poems . regarded as america 's poet , whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s , encompassing both the `` manifest destiny '' ideology of the pre-war , through the reconstruction period of us history . the poems are diverse and upbeat . the language , for the most part , is clear and easy . nevertheless , like most poetry today , the poems are so little different from prose , except in the presentation into lines . very few poetic devises are used . one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry . but , in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow , frost , byron , browning , or shakespeare , current poetry appears meaningless . although a classic , `` leaves of grass '' offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology . none of his poems are memorable . not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature . i give two stars to the work , simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation . whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie , `` dead poet 's society '' ; so , the reputation of the work must be quite impressive , though it beats me how that is
when i received this for christmas the year of its release , i was unaware of the framing issues . i had to ship parts <NUM> and <NUM> back to them for replacements . on top of that , there were warbling sound issues with part <NUM> , and the michael j . fox interview ran about <NUM> chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu . ( this was reported on many websites ) also , the trailers were all full screen , not widescreen . apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the <NUM> re-release . the thing that angers me the most is that since i couldnt return part <NUM> to universal initially , ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen .... ughhhh . i can live with it in fullscreen and i am not gon na exchange the set for a <NUM> set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with universal . thanks for nothing ...... pass this one up until its reissued with new features !
<NUM> % of this thin book is about how many buttons a certain uniform had on it and what type of boots a certain unit wore . almost nothing about the italian army of wwii was in it . a more appropriate title would have been `` the uniforms of the italian army 1940-45 : africa ''
this movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor . are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny ? sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society . i 'm not a stiff when it comes to humor , but i trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with fox . fox network is a base for right-wing republican stupidity . this movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities . i think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of american humor have gone . hurray for the 1st amendments and others our four fathers came up with , i think they were brillant men . i am all for free-speech but i believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public . this film definitely over stepped its boundaries . for all those people who loved this movie ... why are there sooooo many ( around <NUM> ) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago ! ? ! ? ! i thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto ... just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents
come on . i can not play these dual discs in my car nor any regular cd players . j & mc are excellent though
to be quite honest , i do n't understand how anyone could consider this trash to be music . it is just a bunch of noise . i could do what these guys do with a bunch of 13-14 year old amatuer drum , guitar , and bass players in my garage . there is little to no rhythm to their music , and the vocals , quite frankly , are horrible . i ca n't even tell one song apart from another . grindcore just makes metal look bad . the only grindcore bands i actually do enjoy are pig destroyer and agoraphobic nosebleed . go listen to some of their stuff if you want good grindcore . ed gein is just talentless garbage . do n't bother with the tony danza tap dance extravaganza either
back and forth and back and forth . im happy . im sad . happy . sad . love him . dont love him . love him . dont blah . blah blah . we 're poor . we 're not poor . we 're poor . a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas . malamud 's writing style is easy to slip into , and the story is addictive yet annoying ( any pulp novel can be addictive ) . spoiler he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it 's ok ! ( no , do n't try to sell me any of that oh the author 's not giving this his approval , no no no . when there is nothing to contradict something , it 's the same as saying it 's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad . in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me . )
let 's just get this out of the way now . maysa ? i 'm on your team babes , but this cd just has n't done it for me . i got your 1st cd & was hooked . i waited for the next & was floored ! not in a good way ! the cd jacket was so drab & tired , just like damn near every song inside the case . i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again . still i did n't feel it . it 's in my car right now & i still ca n't get through it all . i 'm still on your team though . i have your latest & i play it <NUM> death . over & over . cd 's <NUM> & <NUM> are both must haves . but this <NUM> stinks
i liked the other eisenstein movies that i 've watched . alexander nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were american . battleship potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by hollywood . so i thought i would give this one a try . i really wanted to like this movie . it 's about the russian revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick . i could only get to about half way through the movie ( as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where i stop ) . excellent cinematography and music but i could n't watch more of it . way too thick for me
this is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected . lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself . then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie , the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper . queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music . this is ridiculous ! kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game . please please please spare us and stop rapping
ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had <NUM> years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film . i mean , it has its choice moments where it really comes together . the shot of caine downing a <NUM> in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed . any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status . samuel jackson 's in it . and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character , the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity . but that 's really my problem with this film . serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting . and they 're all here : the homey black grandparents , the nation of islam convert , the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road ... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth . take the french film 'la haine ' , for instance . it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace <NUM> society , boyz n tha hood , etc. , but its characters actually feel tormented , instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment . rather than just running through a laundry list of problems , one-by-one , scene-by-scene , it really gets to the heart of something bigger , some grander alienation that urban youths feel , which is what menace <NUM> society would like to be able to do . plus , if you can believe it , the hip-hop in 'la haine ' is quite a bit better . so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film , keep the remote aimed and ready , finger on the fast-forward button . maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching , whereas the other <NUM> minutes are mostly just dull moralising . oh yeah , and there 's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason . oh , also , the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees . in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight , that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking , but it really just cheapens this one
for months , disney advertised this as a 2-disc special edition dvd . but at the last minute , that second disc mysteriously disappeared . why ? this is false advertising , and if i had my way , disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands . it 's unfair to force people who really want a 2-disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a region-free player . they did this same crap to alice in wonderland , but the other way around . uk lost a disc that we have , and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the us , but not in the uk , and giving fans in the us a 3-disc edition . i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world . unfortunately , i have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a `` special edition '' dvd . i do not appreciate being lied to . i still love disney movies as well as the excellent dvd editions , when disney actually releases the product they 've advertised for months , and i will continue to buy the quality dvd releases , but i do not enjoy false advertisement
do yourselves a favour kids , save your money do n't go to the show , i mean do n't buy this soundtrack . here are some tips about it . it runs for a mere <NUM> minutes . that 's awfully short . there are <NUM> songs and <NUM> portions of dialogue . most of these portions of dialogue last a few seconds , radio announcements of songs . the best portion is the harvey keitel bit , 'if the manager thinks he 's charles bronson , cut off one of his fingers ' . the songs now . little green is a decent enough song , cocunut is a good song . i gotcha is okay . stuck in the middle with you is a good song but has been ruined for me because it has been played to death on tv and radio . the other <NUM> songs are a joke . so basically it 's a total waste of money . the pulp fiction soundtrack is a lot better than this one . stop
if done horribly wrong . cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong anime feel to it . sadly the movie is complete and total garbage . the story here is that jean claude van damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the anarchist future . there also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing mankind , and a cyborg knows the cure . that part of the story is irrelivant . for the most part it is van damm traveling across the us attempting to catch up to this madman and stop him . somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion . overall this movie is a waste and you can tell orion entertainment was milking van damm for all he was worth at this time . avoid
gary b. nash 's purpose for the book is , `` to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the mississippi river . '' ( nash , xxviii ) nash bemoans how the `` great men '' still `` dominate the master narrative [ of the american revolution , ] '' ( nash , xv ) and that we are struck with `` historical amnesia , '' ( nash , xvi ) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the `` great men '' clique . he states that we can not capture the essence of the revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society . these groups not only include the poor farmers , artisans , and other laborers , but also of women , blacks ( both free and slave ) , and of the amerindian population . nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories . to illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society , he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries , which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the parliament . he also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which , in his estimation , helped to spur change all along the way . in the case of the inhabitants of what would become vermont , he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in new york city . led by ethan allen , the `` green mountain boys , '' as they would become known as , fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the new york city landowners had for their property . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the <NUM> state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , <NUM> ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , <NUM> ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , <NUM> ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , <NUM> ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , <NUM> ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , <NUM> ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , <NUM> - <NUM> ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , <NUM> ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the ` great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : <NUM> -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : <NUM> - <NUM> , which explored the military careers of over <NUM> black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed
i did n't listen the disk but know the recording label . never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when i was hooked by the low price : very poor immitations . just go for the real things
back in his day heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys . unfortunately , that day is long past , and heinlein has wandered far from his strength . this book fills in some gaps from time enough for love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint . as was the case in time enough for love , sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme . examples : the two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages <NUM> and <NUM> and with men <NUM> times their age . the male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister , then a young teen , and he , at this point , the oldest man in human history . to make all this go down easier , the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued , and said to be 'tripped ' if she has her way with him . there is a lot more of this 'weird sex ' , but i will move on . this is not really a science fiction story per se , but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story . most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid america . there is n't really a plot . the book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine , seemingly heinlein 's feminine ideal . it is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career . this book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author .
usually i skip over album reviews if they are too extreme ( <NUM> or <NUM> star ) . but it 's quite called for here . can a man rap with any less charisma ? ? ! ! cam 's come quite a long ways , as evidenced by this album . average production . uninspired , generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content . the production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it 's not on purpose . an amateur job all around . it would be nice if this was cut to <NUM> songs and labeled a demo tape . there 's definitely growing pains all throughout . skip to his later selection
dave barry 's novel is a quick read , but there 's nothing fresh about the story or the characters . the story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster -- a columnist , his son , a rich , sleazy lawyer , a wannabe criminal , etc . like elmore leonard 's books , the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways . but the pay-off is just not that great . you may find yourself thinking `` what 's the point ? '' after finishing the novel . this book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast ( tim allen , rene russo , stanley tucci , tom sizemore , etc . )
a mediocre , intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners . its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure , but it sorely lacks depth , committment to its subject , or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity .
wow , i never thought i would 've found an r & b album worse than omarion 's debut until i finished listening to this album 's samples on amazon . `` naked '' , marques houston 's spohomore effort , is undoubtedly the worst r & b album i have ever heard in a long while . i apoligize for sounding harsh , but think about it . where 's the talent ? where 's the skill ? what about the heart & soul ? where 's the musical ambition ? what about meaningful lyrics & nice beats ? where 's his dignity ? where 's hist artistic growth ? i 'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes . marques , take this into account ... you 're not usher and you never will be , so stop trying ! i honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song `` all because of you '' , but i just could n't convince myself to do it . there 's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth . his other singles , `` naked '' & `` sex wit you '' are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality , with egomaniacle , ridicuously retarded videos to boot . as if the cheesy , sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare , you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there . marques houston is a perfect example of why r & b goes downhills nowadays . anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent , and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide . skip this album at all costs ( and i mean that literally )
this book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it . although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming , much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive . in the first chapter , kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations , which boils down to his belief that moore 's law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the big bang to the evolution of life on earth and now the evolution of technology . the second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself : just as evolution `` intelligently '' created us , we will ( soon ! ) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us . it is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways , but the book to this point is best skimmed , because there 's actually very little substance and a lot of dry , pseudo-intellectual filler . chapter <NUM> examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers : what is consciousness , and can machines possess it ? kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here ( his sentences on descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy ) , though he does not try to decide between them . instead , his prediction is social : eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now . this theme comes up again and again , and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book . chapters <NUM> and <NUM> talk about the field of artificial intelligence , where it has been , and where it needs to go . in a section entitled `` the formula for intelligence '' , kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong ai of the future : recursion , neural nets , and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain . this wishful thinking is one of the achilles ' heels of this book . for a software entrepreneuer , kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence : software is hardly becoming more complex or `` intelligent '' at all , let alone exponentially . today 's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly `` smarter '' than systems of past decades , and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations . despite moore 's law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world , progress in the world of software seems , to this software engineer of <NUM> years , to be nearly a flat line , not an exponential curve . just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of windows , versus what it would take to design and implement kurzweil 's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software . part of the problem may be that kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology , which are in their infancy . he does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved ( probably by geniuses ) in order to create `` strong ai . '' instead , the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic : brain deciphering , massively parallel hardware , and genetic algorithms . part <NUM> of the book focuses on potential technologies . the most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers , and he does n't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer , so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person 's mind . kurzweil , in his materialism , does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible . he also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality . part <NUM> of the book is comprised of specific predictions for <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , and <NUM> . this book was written in <NUM> , and we can already see that some of his <NUM> predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in <NUM> , while others wildly miss the mark , such as : `` the majority of reading is done on displays '' , `` the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition '' , and `` intelligent roads are in use , primarily for long-distance travel . '' that kurzweil could be so far off in his <NUM> year predictions does not bode well for his 20- , 30- , and 100-year predictions . indeed , his predictions for <NUM> sound like a science fiction novel , and of the ones that sound plausible i think he must be off by at least <NUM> years . his speculations for <NUM> are just fantastic . in general he seems to `` predict '' based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available , underestimating a myriad of resisting factors : legal , political , social , market , scientific , etc . ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues , but as speculating about technology more than <NUM> years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity , there 's plenty of foolishness to be found in here
after the 1700s , this play fell into obscurity . it was later revived in the mid 1900s . its period of obscurity does not surprise me . believe me , i am a champion for shakespeare 's underrated `` timon of athens '' and `` coriolanus . '' i honestly tried to like this play , but i was forced to concur with the great isaac asimov who said : `` though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy , it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies . it is , indeed , rather an unpleasant play ... '' well , onto the play . we meet the widowed countess , her son bertram , and the elder lafew . we learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal . possibly , helena 's father could have cured the king , but alas , he is dead . the countess gives bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice polonius gave ophelia . ( though the bumbling polonius ends up being easier to like ! ) helena loves bertram , but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity . one comical moment is when parolles reveals that in a way , virginity is a form of vain self love . later , helena cures the king , and helena asks for bertram as a husband . now this is where i have a problem . bertram is made out to be a villain . but how can we possibly not sympathize with him ? maybe helena deserves something for saving the king , but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who does n't like her ? well , bertram is forced to go through with the marriage , but he quickly decides to help florence against siena . poor parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play . this is where i have another problem . rather than the clever misunderstandings of `` the comedy of errors , '' the clever marital confrontations and errors in `` midsummer night 's dream , '' or the comical and clever passages from jaques in `` as you like it , '' the comedy in `` all 's well that ends well '' is reduced to the lowest possible form . ( flat out ridicule ! it is interesting that in the word ridicule , we have the letters for cruel , but i am digressing . ) in one decent elemenet of comedy , bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife . ( and perhaps in time , bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage . it would n't be unheard of . ) one interesting thing is that bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish ' helena . he does n't love her , and therefore will not engage in sex . it is rather repulsive on his mother 's part how she fails to understand the situation . even if she was on helena 's side , she might at least understand bertram 's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage . ( and possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution . ) but no . she just rants and raves . later the countess reads a letter from helena stating that she will leave so bertram can come home from the war . this throws bertram 's mother into yet another rage on helena 's behalf , and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with helena . that is , until our good old uncle isaac asimov points out the hypocrisy of helena : `` helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be . she does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband . '' well , onward . in florence , helena meets with diana ( whom bertram loves ) . and helena thinks she can trick bertram into making her pregnant . we then have the cruel practical joke on parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets ( to friendly forces of course ) or else . perhaps even shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has parolles say : `` who can not be crushed with a plot ? '' ( 4.3.340 ) . we also see bertram try to win the affections of diana . diana of course feels nothing for bertram . but again , the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent . if we accept the fact that bertram should respect diana 's wishes that she does n't love him , how do we account for the fact that helena imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram ? but of course diana consents to meet bertram and of course it will really be helena who meets him . but even tricking bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough . helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home . now in `` much ado about nothing , '' hero had a valid excuse for staging her death . she was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of . but helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram , and she still wants a sympathy party . one redeeming element of the play is that lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced parolles and offers him a job . and of course , in the end bertram feels bad over helena 's staged death and is happy to see her alive again . helena may very well be the britney spears of shakespeare 's characters .
`` blind alley '' is the fifth novel in the continuing story of eve duncan , forensic sculptor , joe quinn , atlanta police detective and jane macguire , their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets . be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but i 'm betting that it 's not going to matter much since you 'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway ! i used to treat iris johansen as a sure thing ! you know what i mean - the kind of author whose new title you 'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you 'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek ! `` blind alley '' buried that thought - cold , deep and fast ! it was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful ! a shadowy serial killer named aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly , gruesome fashion . carving their living faces right off their skulls , aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble cira , a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of herculaneum when vesuvius erupted . it would seem that aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father , an archeologist who became obsessed with cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life . as if that is n't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller , imagine the eyebrows you 'll raise when you read that jane macguire , eve duncan and joe quinn 's adopted <NUM> year old daughter is a ringer for cira . not only does she find herself stalked by aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to cira plagues jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of vesuvius . it does n't end there - johansen tosses mark trevor into the mix . he 's a con and an antiquities smuggler ( picture lovejoy with a nasty streak ! ) who had a run-in with aldo and is intent on killing him . to that end he intrudes himself into eve duncan 's and joe quinn 's life and sets himself up as jane 's protector . now , i 'm no prude but the scene in which trevor , a grown man at least as old as joe , has a near sexual encounter with jane , a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality , is just plain distasteful and , frankly , scored well into the red zone on the `` yuk '' meter ! there is just so much wrong with this novel , it 's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start , happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all ; unlike any previous johansen novel i 've read , the characters and dialogue seem trite , wooden and completely contrived ; the outcome of mark trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved ; eve duncan 's obsession with her murdered daughter , bonnie , continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating ; a wonderful sub-plot concerning eve 's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed ! i still own a few johansen titles that i have n't read so there is perhaps hope . but she 'll have to prove to me that she has n't jumped the shark before i 'll spend another cent on a new title ! paul weiss
it was n't as impactful as i thought it would be . some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others , well , other gave comments . the selection of people was a good cross section but it did n't have meaning to it . i was looking for more in depth commentary . maybe what i was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book . it might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together
heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention . unfortunately , these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere . this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein 's final books . we are also treated to some of heinlein 's stock characters , dirty old men , horny female computers , naked adolescent girls , and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips . without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after <NUM> would have a sparse population indeed . as if this is n't enough , heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing . in spite of all their cameo appearances , this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout . heinlein 's earlier novels written prior to <NUM> are still fine fare for young people , especially boys . this novel , as well as most of heinlein 's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption
if celebrated film director ed wood ( plan <NUM> from outer space ) made an album , it would sound like this . the transformed man by william shatner is n't flawed or ill-conceived , it 's perfectly dreadful , reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock . each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears . this smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of shatner 's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project 's breathtaking stupidity . if the phrase , `` so bad it 's good , '' is in your lexicon , the transformed man just might be your guy . ( warning : do not operate heavy equipment while listening to this cd . )
first off , the atticus collections never feature great music ; with the exception of the occasional song . hate to break everyone 's hearts . this one in particular is chock fulla corny , sappy , pop-punk goodness . not that it 's not fun to listen to , but ( and like i said , with certain exceptions ) there 's nothing on here that you could n't see on mtv and make a mixtape out of . taking <NUM> bands , half of them sub-par , and putting together a collection of the only single ( if you can call it that ) off their latest lame album does n't make a quality recording . if you 're looking for something a bit more edgy , try picking up the complilations put together by the indie labels themselves of the best songs from their artists . because this is usually where you 're going to find stand-out tracks that you can really appreciate for the fact that you like it , not because blink-182 says they 're cool ( and no disrespect because i love blink too ) . that 's just my advice . to everyone who does really enjoy the music on here that 's cool too . i 'd still rather hear dragging the lake blaring out of someones car than the newest dj kay slay or funkmaster flex mixtape that 's for sure , or should i say , fo sho . and to the previous reviewer who commented that the worst track on the album is saosin 's bury your head ; if you had any musical taste beyond blink or mxpx because they 're `` frickin awesome '' you 'd know that anthony green is one of the most respected vocalists in the independant scene . saosin 's translating the name ep featuring green on vocals is held by many as one of the best independant debut eps of all time . if you want further proof , download the acoustic version of seven years and tell me if you can think of another emo-vocalist with anywhere near the same range . it 's always better to open your ears before you open your mouth .
the acclaim and good reviews for this book are mistaken - it is average work by an above average artist who his a sophomore slump with this , his second book . sleeping by the mississippi , as derivative as it may be , was deeper and more soulful than this work which offers not much new in contemporary photography .
i must say before i write this review , i tried . i tried really hard to get into this album . i am a huge pink floyd fan , a fan of all classic rock for that matter . i got this cd for it 's historical significance . it is , after all , the first rock opera . anything you hear about this album being similar to the wall by pink floyd is false . true , it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual , but it does n't get as advanced or deep as pink floyd does . there are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal . the music . original as it may be , the who 's strange melodies and instrumentation do n't do anything for me . the melodies are for the most part , predictable . when they try to go out on a limb , it fails and sounds forced . the guitar parts and solos sound thin , and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording is n't prime quality , i 'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job . it has it 's moments , for example , the first few secconds of `` smash the mirror '' . but on the whole , it sounds almost like amateurs . the songs . not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans , but the songs seem to be forced into the opera mold . while this may make it more of a true `` rock opera '' than `` the wall '' , for example , it does n't make for a very easy listen . the horrible thing is that it is possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow . exhibit a : queen 's `` a night at the opera '' . although queen 's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot . which leads me into my next point . lack of depth . while musicians who do n't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me , they should n't try to make arena rock operas . the who 's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera . it ca n't be done effectively within the limits of the band . i did give this album two stars . one for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run , and another star for those few moments it has . smash the mirror ( the introduction ) , pinball wizard and the acid queen are alright . there is a reason why those tracks are popular . i 'm afraid that a lot of people are n't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is `` the who '' , the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage . if you are looking for a rock opera , i suggest `` a night at the opera '' or `` the wall '' . if you are looking for another `` the who '' album , i would suggest some of their later works . `` the who sells out '' was alright , certiantly better than this .
go to www.cremaster.net and download the trailer for the full cremaster cycle . . . . then realize how awesome it looks and how much this dvd sucks . i was wondering where the movie was on this dvd , but then realized you only get a <NUM> minute clip and can watch lots of alternat shots of the same stuff . the minute long trailer on the website is sooooo much better . highlight : camera movement is kool when it moves all slow and stuff
well the title seems to fit the dvd `` fast '' but in a different aspect , as far as time goes . i thought this was very boring and slow , but it was over in no time at all . it probably would be great for someone just beginning and has very little or no time at all to exercise and it does n't work up a sweat . it was very very easy to do and i 'm a beginner myself
i found this video to be a real snoozer . while the title `` my first time '' suggests a sexy look at guy 's first experiences , nothing could be farther from the truth . this video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases . while it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid , if i knew that sex ed is what this video preached about ( i.e . how to use a condom ) , i would have passed . this video is produced in england , and for an american , the accents can be distracting . my recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex , get this video . if you know the ropes , pass on this one
disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best dvd 's ever made.the jungle book limited issue is the best movie ever made.my grandson watches it all the time . its made for the child also the adult like me . i bought jungle book <NUM> totally dissapointed in the dvd . i did not like it at all i returned it.its a horible movie for children : disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.i give this dvd a -
we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch . can anyone say buzz and woody ? chicken run ? the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies -- almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story <NUM> . how many times can you do the a-bomb joke ... worse still is the dialogue , the painfully unfunny one-liners , and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions . it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another , and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest . there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest . this film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry .
i thoroughly enjoyed reading nancy 's book , and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems . but , when i tried to utilize her techniques , nothing fit at all . it was a big disappointment
so now we have the female version of '' oz '' ... '' oz '' of course was the american cable soap opera show about a bunch of notorious scum , which treated these losers in such a way as to make thier rotten lives , twisted morality and worthless goals palatable .. of course the '' critics '' loved this show , but then again the '' critics '' seem to love anything that is not decent , or made for the mainstream audience ... this is why the '' people 's choice '' awards differ so greatly from the other `` professionals-only '' awards shows , like the oscars .. '' bad girls '' is merely an '' oz '' retread , only this time around the losers are females ... the plots are much the same .. the same sort of bottom-feeder losers , only this time they have jiggle ... the same sort of rotten lives , the same sort of twisted goals , the same worthlessness of charecter ... most of the charecters in both `` oz '' and `` bad girls '' ought to be put to death rather than glorified on a teevee series .. '' oz '' and this garbage are poster examples of why there ought to be a death penalty that is universal and immediate upon conviction ... one can only wonder what bottom of the barrel group our '' entertainment '' industry will glorify next ? maybe some enterprising , and perverted , mind out there is even now writing the pilot script for `` a year with adolf , eva , goebbels , himmler , the concentration camps & you '' , in which the nazis are seen as just plain folks , misunderstood in thier race-baiting and thier mass exterminations ... why not ? every other bottom-feeder group seems to be getting a cable soap opera show that seeks to portray them in other than realistic terms , so why not the nazis ? and after the nazis , can the inquisition , or the armenian genocide be far behind
i used to like these guys , but the more songs i hear by minor threat and tsol , the more i realize how the offspring were just copycats . what a discrace to punk . i wish bands like the offspring , good charlotte , green day , blink <NUM> , simple plan , and new f @ g glory would just ( ... ) off ! the only `` american idiots '' are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk . `` we 're just a minor threat !
an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful & quot ; eat drink man woman & quot ; . frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first .. i just finished watching eat drink .. it took me about <NUM> minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago . anyway , i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup , eat drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me . if you have n't seen either , see the better of the two ( exact same stories ) : eat drink man woman
i came upon this book by random chance , and was mislead to believe that this was a piece of true literature . a book ( short story really ) that stumbles towards nothing . if you 're looking for some popcorn reading , sure this might suite you just fine , but avoid like that plague otherwise . i suggest picking up some vonnegut or yates . i hope this review might save at least one of you ! ! ! ps : avoid frustratingly pointless epilogue ..
as curious as i was about this movie it had me dazed . the 'good shepherd ' always struck me symbol for christianity . shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten . what 's good about that ? fortunately , sheep do n't have the intelligence to be paranoid . with bourne identity movies under his belt , matt damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies . is this one a killer or dead on arrival ? with a budget of $ 85m , we 've got oscar-winning actors , writers , cinematographers , and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see . pet project of actor-turning-director , robert de niro , `` the good shepherd '' tells a story of the cia from its early days , weighing in at just under three hours . the scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that 's miss you wo n't get it . this is a shame , because it 's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot . this movie is told from damon 's point of view , its scope is epic , and covering the years from <NUM> before the cia was even a speck in president truman 's eye , to <NUM> and the bay of pigs . we see the founding years , the london blitz , post-war reconstruction in berlin , and increasingly intricate machinations as the cold war gathers pace . angelina jolie does n't feature in much of the movie , but when she does , she ' get into character very well . it 's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable . robert de niro ( got to love him ) , in the director 's chair , is sadly the weakest link . although he handles it professionally , almost magisterially , he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum , convey gradual moral decay , or make this the godfather standard-bearer of cia films . he 's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew . what he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world 's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity ; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to , given that his mentors are people like francis ford coppola ( who is the executive producer ) . with sufficient dedication , it is easy to imagine de niro pulling off an oscar for direction in a future film : his grasp is very broad , and all it needs is a little tweaking .
there 's nothing in this book that is n't in many other photography books . much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques , rather than approaches to creativity ( as is implied by the sub-title of the book ) . the photos are far from inspiring . i did n't learn anything from this book
i have been practicing yoga for several years and was looking for a way to introduce it to my partner . i found this book to be poorly laid out and i did not feel it had a cohesive theme . the poses were awkward , did not have the insight i was looking for
cradle to grave was , for me , a let down . i expected to see more jet li action . he seemed held back , as if he could not fully express his abilities . it appears as though he did not want to `` show up '' the other actors . as much of a jet li fan as i am , i regret to say that this move disapointed me . bmx and jet li did not fit together well . i think that jet li 's part could almost have been anybody else . the story also disapointed me . it did not seem right that a cop , ( from tiwan ) and a thief got together to save the world . it did n't make sense .
there are <NUM> <NUM> star reviews and <NUM> one star reviews . this is more representative than an analysis based only on the last <NUM> reviews . but what is more notable than that is the fact that the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them . lone nut theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false . posner totally disregards the parkland hospital doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head . he would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot . that somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts . to expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting .
i bought a couple of bob vidoes through amazon for my son , age nearly <NUM> , who loves the series . we were crushingly disappointed by these videos , though . the wonderful voices of the uk version ( neil morissey et . al ) have been replaced by american voices . why do they do that ? for us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ai n't bob . british shoppers and anyone familiar with the original bob should be warned . ( can i get my money back ?
i am in my twenties now and am more into drama films and trendy artistic films from foreign countries ( chalk that up to my wife 's influence on me ) , but i still have a guilty predeliction for unapologetically mindless action movies where things blow up , bad guys do bad things for no apparent reason , and ( of course ) a heroic character defeats countless enemies using martial arts and other cool fighting techniques , while those same countless numbers of villains fail to kill him despite firing millions of rounds of machine gun ammunition at him . i used to love van damme movies when i was aged 8-14 , back when he was making better films , although i 've always considered him a subpar actor ( the same is also true , in my opinion , for arnold swarzennegger ) . i thought his martial arts scenes in movies like bloodsport and kickboxer were worth the rental price ( or , in those days , asking my mom or dad to rent them for me ) . then came <NUM> 's timecop , and i absolutely loved that movie ( as a child -- now it seems kind of tame and not as good as i remembered it ) . i thought vandaame was finally becoming a better actor and fast on his way to being a megastar . unfortunately , vandamme 's career has faded since then , after a string of box-office and critical failures , and he has become more of a b-grade star and direct-to-video actor a-la michael dudinkoff ( american ninja ) . it 's good to see that he 's still working , but it seems like his work is really sucking right now . one exception might be <NUM> 's legionnaire , a vandamme movie that is surprisingly good , though certainly no hard target -- a movie from his glory days . for me , i think one of the biggest reasons why van damme is on a downward spiral as far as his movies go ( aside from his lousy acting ) is because he 's lost credibility as a martial arts virtuoso . i chalk this up to the time he allegedly got beat up at a nightclub . in the version i heard , van damme was purportedly behaving in an obnoxious manner in the club , and security naturally confronted him and asked him to moderate his behavior , or leave . van damme then allegedly began mouthing off at the security guard ( a beefy skinhead-looking guy ) and performing various martial arts moves apparently designed to intimidate the other guy . the other guy , i guess , was n't impressed because he then decked van damme with one right cross and van damme left the club on a stretcher . sigh . how the mighty have fallen . oh , by the way , second in command sucks .
i own a strategy guide for every final fantasy game , and this one was sorely disappointing . i think the only guide that has been worse than this is the ff9 'playonline ' joke ( that no longer exists online ) . the strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game ( such as how to find aeris ' limit break before disc <NUM> ) , how you can reach certain areas , where to find items , who to have in your party in certain areas , etc . the information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing . some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide . all in all , do n't waste your money on this guide . you 're better off buying the brady version instead
one of the most overrated comedy shows ever . basically the calibre of a high school talent show . in a way it reminds me of tom goes to the mayor , seemingly fitting into a comedy niche i do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever , but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird . i 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head . i think these guys took that a bit too much to heart . maybe the fans see some subtle naunces i 'm missing , but to me it seems like i could have written most of this material with little effort .
if you are a real hard core sonny chiba collector , then this is not worth your time , because he does n't do really anything in this flick ! why is it not in widescreen ? why is there no original language track ? this is dvd right ? if you still want this movie to fill the gap in your chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality
she has some rockin songs on here . all her singles kickass and the last song on the album with m.i.a . ( i friggin love her ) is fire . but then , i start listening to the other songs , ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i ca n't find another . all of missy 's singles are crazy , but then ui listen to the album , and its like a let down . any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases . if you really liked missy 's album 'this is not a test ' , then get this album . but if you are lovin her singles and want some more , just download the singles , do n't waste your money on the rest of this album .
buyer beware . after paying for this book , the dvd-rom will prompt you to pay another us $ <NUM> for <NUM> additional exercises . that 's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description . this is wrong . i suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner , the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises
i can not rate this item because it came defective . i have not been able to view it . very disappointed by this transaction . i plan to send this item back
was disappointed in the ideas . seemed to be more of an extension of the author 's collections , than ideas for the reader . scanned the book it and put it on the shelf , wo n't be one that i use as a constant reference
these guys have n't put a good album out since floored . lemonade and brownies is a great metal album and by far their best . once & quot ; fly & quot ; was a hit , it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans . when i heard the first single off this album , i almost cried to see how low this band has gone . i ca n't believe mark mcgrath was in that angel 's song for sevendust . now there 's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums
title says it all . i enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series . forth book sort of dragged . by the middle of this book i had to make a decision ... keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel . let 's face it , life 's too short . if you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of `` the stand '' . i 'm afraid this does n't do it . think about it another way do you want to read over <NUM> pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers ? cheer
this cd is just plain horrible . it lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get . hey , the grateful dead was a good band , but new hippie-wanna-be bands just do n't have the talent . the only people who buy these albums are just <NUM> year old freshmen in high school looking for an excuse to be & quot ; popular. & quot ; well , my bashing has been done , so i will leave you on this note ; if you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music once , does n't it just get plain boring
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good . however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people . in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine . i sat through this film , against my better judgement . still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend `` a streetcar named desire '' , `` kids '' , `` last exit to brooklyn '' , and `` traffic '' .
i 'm tremendously dissapointed by this product . i ca n't express in words how angry i am at having to spend <NUM> hours repairing my computer after the cd installed a backdoor on to my that allow sony to access any file on my computer . its infuriating how the goverment has allowed sony/bmg to do this to us . if a person has hacked millions of computers and installed software that allowed access to the entire harddrive , that person would be in prison . sony /bmg did this to us and they get away with a slap on the wrist . despite the harm that this cd has done to me , i 'm keeping it . it will be a symbol that i will use remind myself how our corrupt goverment is controlled by corporate interests -- and the harm that these corporations cause to increase their profits
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius , he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro , awesome ! hoffman , awesome ! streisand , awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless , and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie , these a-1 actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film , and i recommend it to every and anyone to see , but wear your depends , because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya <NUM> , you do n't know what in the friggin ' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser , that complains about going out to the movies ? stay home , i 'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
these guys have the corner on strange listen to me if you are curious music that most of the time makes you wonder if it makes sense , or if you are really entertained . i bought it for the theme song from veronica mars , we used to be friends , which is a great tune . i find it hard to find anthing else that matches up to it . i have muddled through it , but wish i would have found it elsewher
amazon service is fantastic but only some parts in the will ferrel dvd 's were funny - nothing i would recommend to people
=== quote pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously moonies . this is should be required reading . nansook hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the korean flake who thinks he 's god . === end funny , so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the um , why is this ? also rev . moon himself does n't claim to be god , this is always said by others , rev.moon stresses the point without god he would be nothing ...
