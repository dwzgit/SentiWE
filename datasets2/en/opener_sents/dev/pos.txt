this is a deliriously silly little movie , but it 's fun to watch . kim basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human , from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo . basinger 's comic timing carries the movie , and even the usually disposable dan aykroyd 's performance is comic and he and basinger have a good chemistry . there are some delightful sequences , e.g. , when kim has to discover how to kiss , her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses , and when she has to have sex , she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all . jon lovitz is around for comic relief as aykroyd 's bachelor brother , and it 's all mindless nonsense ; it 's also quite entertaining . basinger is a blast
one of the delightful things about this book is that it treats children as thinking beings , yet still manages to contain all of the magic and adventure of childhood . as in all of her work , e. nesbit tells an exciting story while encouraging the reader to consider the meaning of things . one of the best books written by one of the best children 's writers of all time
he must be broken half ...... jr could have invented that phase just to use it in every mick foley match . foley made a career by taking bumps , but he is also a great wrestler and this dvd goes along way to showcase that . so stop reading this review and buy it
this film is easily in the top <NUM> of fritz lang 's best films , and quite possibly his # <NUM> best sound film as well . in addition to being lang 's debut sound film , it was also germany 's very first sound film , and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures . almost every sound film from the late twenties and very early thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter , as though film-making just went backwards in time by about <NUM> years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true `` motion pictures . '' but by <NUM> , a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out , and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece . and unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound , lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence . he knew that the actors did n't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching . of course , the director is only one part of the film 's genius ; the actors are brilliant too , in particular peter lorre , who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role . the film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre , what with the terrific shadows , lighting , and suspenseful mood and atmosphere . the film does start out a little slowly , but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling . the plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it . lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well , and this film is no exception . a child murderer is on the loose , and with no answers in sight , the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty , particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals . the people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations , and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves , but to do it all without any help from the police , who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to . even criminals have standards ; it 's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by `` ordinary '' criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did . when the criminals finally track down hans beckert , the murderer , at a warehouse , they tie up the night watchmen so they wo n't alert the police , so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves , even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there . the final section of the film , in the criminals ' kangaroo court , is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film . one starts out feeling repugnance at this menace , this person who molests and kills children , but by the time the film is up , one ca n't help but feel sorry for him , or at least see him as a human being . we never see him hurting children , and do n't even see his face right away . he 's not shown as a monster or an evil person ; indeed , who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer ? the treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era . while what he 's done is n't being excused or apologised for , he 's ultimately shown to be a victim himself , a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him , doing these horrible horrible things because of it , only finding peace when he 's committing these criminal acts . is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle , people who could have become bank tellers , teachers , or doctors , people who had a choice because they did n't have this monster constantly following them ? this must have been a positively revolutionary idea in <NUM> , when many people blamed people like beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it , when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control . it 's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it , and only gets better with multiple viewings . extras include audio commentary , an interview with fritz lang a year before his death ( once again he tells the tall tale of his meeting with goebbels and how he left germany late at night with barely any money , never to return until after wwii , even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture ! ) , the mini-documentary ' a physical history of m , ' a gallery of pictures , stills , and drawings , an interview with harold nebenzal ( son of producer seymour nebenzal ) , a ten-minute version of 'm ' made by claude chabrol , and excerpts from discussions editor paul falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film . overall , this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history ; one ca n't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it . this film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film , instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it 's great or if it 's just overrated
martin scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he . but , of course , scorsese really should have won for mean streets , taxi driver , raging bull , or goodfellas , and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement . this is a decent , entertaining picture , but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best , i think , or one of the best pictures of recent years . the acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast : it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts . damon is surprisingly good , capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness , and walhberg stands out , though he is on screen too rarely . dicaprio does a nice job , except that i think sometimes the pressure to have him play `` vulnerable '' and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative : that no one believes him to be the cop , given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence , is a bit preposterous . the basic storyline , which is almost exactly the same , scene for scene , as in infernal affairs , is a pretty neat one , with a lot of nice reversals and twists , though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie . but , somehow , for me , this film just ultimately did n't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it . perhaps because i had seen the original version of this tale , the specific changes and updates made to it in monahan 's script to make things `` scorsesian '' seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic . in the end , i had this peculiar feeling like i had just seen almost an imitation scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones , pasted onto the infernal affairs framework . it may be that , after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent , more personal projects , a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground , to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment , and thus maybe even scorsese 's heart was n't totally into this project ; while certainly there 's an energy here , the technical work does n't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work . it may also be that , after living with the sopranos for years and all the scorsese wanna-be mob pictures , that i am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre , that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me . so , certainly recommended for viewing , but the departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done
this is an excellent entry piece into italian fiction ( in translation ) , especially for those seeking works set during world war ii and the rise of fascism in italy . ranks with the best of international 20th century literature
lifehouse no name face a superb album that features that single that every remembers as `` hanging by a moment '' do n't be fooled into thinking that the calling were doing something new this is the band whom had the deep voice the superb gritty guitars and belting drums and bass too make you deaf i heard `` hsnging by a moment '' on vigin radio and my first impressions were sounds a bit like the grunge bands but i loved the song and virgin did n't tell me who it was .. so i had to wait about another <NUM> months until they played it again and i heard them say there name and i thought was `` lifehouse '' the rock opera pete townsend tried to make but did n't suceeded then i realise this .. album is a classic gritty belting heart beating album that struck a chord with me .. all the way through and that a strange thing for that to happen ... this album features a classic `` sick cycle carousel '' `` somwhere in between '' `` simon '' with amazing lyrics and a sense of purpose of making music from the heart not just formulated for success a classic album and i think it was their only album really
only die hard fans of gershwin should buy the massive songbook ella and nelson riddle made in <NUM> , because the great songs are all included here.back in those days , gershwin was still considered the best american composer , probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded , and also because of the fact that he died young.nowadays we know that richard rodgers and johnny mercer are the deserving legends of american popular music.having said that let me say that this collection is perfect , it 's really the best.personal favorites of mine are someone to watch over me and but not for me.even the guy from texas should enjoy that one
it 's a [ more vulnerable ] patton in a white coat , running a hospital , and it 's all great fun , with a good story from an oscar-winning script . you have to love it when scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow . you half-expect him to finish her off with `` there are brave men dying out there ! ''
while my musical tastes span a wide range of genres , i 've long been intrigued by jazz and the blues - both are enigmatic and haunting , yet not exactly a part of popular music today . so it was with great expectations that i purchased this set , hoping for a strong foundation upon which i could explore the giants of jazz - and eventually work my way down to contemporary jazz artists . this collection fits that bill beyond compare . some favorites i already knew are here , such as glenn miller and benny goodman - along with sublime jazz geniuses such as coleman hawkins , count basie , and charlie parker . sure , as other reviewers have noted , the set is a bit heavy on louis armstrong and duke ellington , but i doubt you 'll be disappointed with any of the tracks included here . aside from the wonderful music , you also receive an informative and beautifully designed booklet . it includes not only an essay on the origins of jazz , but a song-by-song write up that 's unequaled by any other collection i 've purchased . i 'm more than up to date on jazz music , as well as gaining a profound appreciation for the genre . simply put , if you 're curious about jazz as i once was , this is the absolute perfect way to initiate yourself into the library of jazz . ( on a side note , if you want a great blues primer , i 'd suggest the martin scorsese set .
this is a wonderful tool to keep track of all those mystery books on your shelves . this book offers a comprehensive listing of women 's fiction mysteries . books are listed by author and title . it is great way to see the order of books written in a series . there is also a check list where you can check off the book once you purchase it , and then check it after you read it . i like to make notations next to the books once i finish the book . books that have been nominated or received awards are designated with a star by the title
this 4th band album has gotten a bad rap over the years . only because the first <NUM> were so legendary . i tell you what , do yourself a favor and listen to this album again , i was amazed how good it really is . with songs like the river hymm , life is a carnival , moon struck one , shoot out in chinatown an dthe underrated volcano , it 's an album most bands would die for to make .
first , i 'd like to stress that this book , just like its title indicates , is not supposed to appeal to the nostalgia-ridden fans and conspiracy theorists that once found common ground on movies like 'jfk . ' seymour hersh 's 'dark side of camelot ' is indicting as it is jaw-dropping . in one of the more revealing accounts , hersh takes on the task of dispelling the peace-loving , freedom-advocate myth surrounding the j.f . kennedy cult by confirming a long-held , yet underrated perpective that historical events such as the cuban missile crisis were in great part exacerbated by the late president and his brother robert 's domestic political ambitions , even when doing so required using the mafia as a reliable ally for the defense of the 'free world ' as depicted by the kennedys . it was the kennedys ' obsesion to bring castro down and the urge to appear 'strong of communism ' that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with the prospect of a catastrophic invasion that was planned after the bay of pigs fiasco . hersh accounts of us and soviet generals , cia officers , and other sources of authority complement this view with chilling details . the vietnam war also had kennedy 's fingerprints all over it , according to hersh 's findings . kennedy 's was as eager as richard nixon to continue running the war at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives when the former approved of vietnamese strongman diem 's murder , although kennedy was well aware that diem and his brother had started backchannel negotiations with the communist and buddhist opposition in south vietnam to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict . at the end , diem 's pro-us rivals in the military took over and resumed the reign of terror and reppression that had been encouraged by kennedy 's most hawkish advisers in the pentagon . the 'dark side of camelot ' is not only a political indictment of john f. kennedy , but also an impeachment on utter immorality by a u.s. head of state . in one of at least four main accounts from ex-secret service officers , president kennedy was courted by members of his cabinet with young club girls who were often threatened with lock-ups in asylums if they dared to speak about their sexual anecdotes with president kennedy and his entourage . kennedy 's promiscuous behavior opened the door for venereal diseases , such as chlamydia , to haunt him until the day of his death , according to medical records cited by hersh . for revelations like these ones , it is likely that the 'dark side of camelot ' be dismissed as a gossip-teller on the sexual life of john f. kennedy , however , it will prove immensely valuable for those who wish to pursue the trail of elussive puzzle parts that shaped u.s. government policy during some of the most impacting world events of the 20th century
i first read a technique for producing ideas <NUM> years ago . webb explains simply , effectively , and with brevity how `` creativity '' happens in our minds . you will develop `` habits of the mind '' that will stay with you for life . really . anyone can be creative and everyone should read this book . it 's not just for advertising people -- anyone who creates ( scientists , engineers , businesspeople , etc . ) will become smarter and more creative
i ca n't explain how powerfully this album moves me . at first listen , i was disappointed . there was no `` night of the swallow , '' no `` moving , '' or other rousing songs that make me want to dance , alone , in the night . then , i read someone 's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone . i made time for this album . time alone for me is scarce , but i missed kate and made room for her . we cooked together , went on long walks , even went running once or twice . i fell in love with `` sunset '' first . the flamenco guitars , the rhythm picking up , the multiple sky images . i listen to this and feel one with the sky . it is such a positive , beautiful album . listening to it feels like a religious experience . this is not party music . it 's not for socializing either . i had a good friend over and i just wanted to tell her to stop talking so i could soak in this beautiful , beautiful music . kate 's voice is softer here . she wears her motherhood comfortably , and it shows , yet she still has that incredible vocal range . i had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me . i was wrong . that does n't mean i like all songs equally . i listen to the songs on the first disk ( especially while running ) , but it 's disk <NUM> that captured my heart . `` sunset , '' then `` nocturn . '' then , sweet `` aerial : '' `` i want to be up on the roof i 've got ta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun . '' i am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience . you have to live it , immerse yourself in it , give yourself over to it . for those of you disappointed with it , i recommend giving it another chance . especially listen to it outside . i think you might yourself similarly entranced as i was .
the first time that i read this book was with a group of four-year-olds . they enjoyed it so much that they immediately asked to have it read again . the story and pictures draw one into an imaginative world . the little girl in the story is looking for her stuffed dog , sally , who is lost in the quilt . the squares of the quilt become a wonderful landscape with the little girl calling , & quot ; sally ! & quot ; trying to find her dog . the second time through the story the four-year-olds were calling , & quot ; sally , & quot ; along with me as i read . delightful
this mgm-produced biography of french scientist marie curie is produced with the usual studio gloss . film drags at times and presumambly plays fast and loose with the facts , but still worth a look , especially for great teaming of greer garson and walter pidgeon , who has some of his best moments here ; his proposal scene is classic
... but the materials criterion put together for this great two disc set shed new insight and light to one of the greatest chambara films ever made . thank you , criterion , for taking my email ( and who knows how many others ) seriously and for bringing this pristine and wonderful dvd transfer of a true classic . this movie should be in every serious cinephile 's collection , and i highly recommend this two disc set
it arrived in a timely manner and in great shape . it played just fine and i enjoyed every minute of the story
this book is straightforward , breaking down each step of the heroic journey , from the hero 's birth to apotheosis , using examples from various mythologies/religions to establish the classical pattern used in literature . if you just want to brush up and increase your ability to identify the pattern in literature/pop culture ( ie . aliens movies , the matrix , xena , buffy , providence ... ) this is a handy reference and a quick read

a stunning discovery in belgian archives of a concert in brussels in <NUM> with the famous line-up with benny golson ( tenor ) and lee morgan ( trumpet ) that lasted only <NUM> months . benny golson 's now famous compositions like ' i remember clifford ' and whisper not ' are still fresh , and it is incredible to actually see 20-years old lee morgan and hear how mature his playing was . the only visual document of a live performance of a legendary group . and excellent quality
if you like to read histories of the great age of scientific discovery , you 'll enjoy this story of william smith and his development of the world 's first geology map . the bonus is the dustcover is actually a copy of his map
if simply for kathryn williams ' `` buzzin ' fly '' and stephen fretwell 's rendition of `` morning theft , '' this album is worth getting ... all the songs are genuinely new takes on these two amazing musicians ... highly recommende
throughout coltrane 's prolific recording career he performed with many great musicians . one glance at his discography can affirm this fact and this disc features , arguably , his best surrounding musicians ; they have become known as simply the classic quartet . the featured aartists are jimmy garrison on bass , mccoy tyner on piano , elvin jones on drums and jc on saxophone ( s ) . if you are a collector of coltrane music this is a must have disc since it features his classic quartet in fine form . this is a late seminal recording from around the time of tranes album & quot ; ascension. & quot ; the title track , & quot ; living space & quot ; is a profound piece and an inspirational piece of artistry that is emotionally stirring . trane is featured playing in his innovative modal mode that was influenced from the timelessness of eastern indian music . since this was a posthumous release there are several tracks that were found that are untitled having only vault numbers . do not let this put you off since they are some of finest songs on the disc but not having a name to associate with the melody is a bit challenging for the listener . trane is at his improvisational best , reaching both vertically and horizontally on his sound , overlapping and interweaving with staggering results . the importance of the classic quartet to the totality of the sound can not be overly emphasized ; it was a combustible union that created magic that has lasted for generations . mccoy tyner played with a bouyancy that allowed for the shifting of sound in directions that were held together by the driving drums and pounding of the skins by elvin jones . this coupled with the thumping , harmonic bass of jimmy garrison created the one of tightest groups ever assemled in the annals of jazz history.this disc shows the fluidity of the players , each part contributing to the whole for a sound that has yet to be duplicated.trane is bluesy , melodic , at times he plays in a far reaching , writhing style , but eventually the tenderness returns for the warm lush sound that only he has been able to produce . his ceaseless explorations on the saxophone , exemplified by his quest for a muscial spirtitual search comes through on this fine collection of recordings . pieces of & quot ; a love supreme & quot ; and fragments of & quot ; my favorite things & quot ; can be heard echoing through the solos of trane as he explores his inner sanctity revealing his consciousness . this is definitely a disc for the coltrane or jazz connoisseur that features some of the last recrdings of the classic quartet . an excellent recording by some of the best at their collective apogee
good morning vietnam is one of robin williams ' earliest forays into drama . while the world according to garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama , good morning maintains a much better balance . the first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in saigon . mitch markowitz 's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other . director barry levinson successfully harnessed the comedian 's wild , manic energy in this movie . of course , the williams ' radio monologues ( famously adlibbed by the comedian ) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour ( `` what 's the difference between the army and the cub scouts ? cub scouts do n't have heavy artillery. '' ) . williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in . his best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision ( peter weir , terry gilliam and gus van sant ) and this one is no different . even though good morning is essentially a vehicle for williams , levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors , like robert wuhl , bruno kirby and j.t . walsh . along with oliver stone 's heaven and earth , good morning vietnam gives a human dimension to the vietnamese people . unlike many other vietnam war movies of the ` 80s , the vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities . this incarnation is an improvement over the previous dvd . there is a six part `` production diary '' that runs <NUM> minutes . this is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real adrian cronauer who is interviewed . he sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on ( and the film 's title ) . director barry levinson talks about robin williams ' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script . one part also focuses on the film 's fantastic soundtrack of ` 60s rock ` n ' roll music and the role it played in the movie . another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there . add to that the extremely hot weather which , incidentally , gave the film a certain amount of authenticity . there are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly , only cast members bruno kirby and robert wuhl are back with williams no where to be found . `` raw monologues '' features <NUM> minutes of footage from williams ' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes . there is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form , watching how williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations . finally , there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers
jackies done it again with a true to life hollywood book . she 's already hit the husbands and wives . now those snotty little kids of hollywood got a whole book to themselves . i love it
i would recommend anyone getting into the terminator series should see this movie first . colossus - the forbin project demonstrates how computers and machines take over the world and for humanities first struggle to become free . very good plot and detail
i remember this show very well.just as the sun dipped out of sight the stage lights went on and the band blasted into `` pearly queen '' and `` medicated goo '' and it was like muscial heaven hearing this stuff actually played live ( after hearing it so many times on cd ) . the only way to really experience traffic is live and this tour was the last chance to do that ( now that wood and capaldi are both gone ) . traffic 's sound remains unique , its never really been imitated . and this band has never received much radio attention ( save the occasional `` dear mr. fantasy '' ) and though everyone knows who steve winwood is , a lot of people still do n't know traffic 's music . but thats fine with me , they are like a well kept secret and this allowed us fans to be able to actually afford tickets to see them when they came through our towns in the summer of '94 . another advantage of this bands notoriety-lesness is that none of these songs sound dated . in fact much of the traffic catalogue ( with the exception of a few psychedelic numbers on their first two albums ) sounds timeless ( i 'm thinking here especially of the john barleycorn and when the eagle flies albums ) . masterfully played and highly evocative folk and jazz as well as good ol ' blues-based rock does not date . hearing these styles played next to each other as well as mixed together is as exciting as music gets . i must say , though , that the sole number played from their new album far from home called `` mozambique '' sounds a bit too much like santana . that does n't mean its not a good song and i love santana but it did n't make me want to buy far from home . i was not a first generation traffic fan but i became interested in the band in the early <NUM> 's so this tour came along at just the right time for me . i 've never been a steve winwood fan and his solo stuff just seems weak and souless to me . i would say his solo stuff sounds like a watered down radio friendly traffic or a traffic without the imagination but to my ears his solo stuff just does n't sound like traffic at all . with the spencer davis group and with blind faith ( and a live dvd of blind faith is now available as well ) and especially with traffic , however , winwood made music that is absolutely unique and has that unforgettable magic to it that few folk/rock/jazz/blues groups or groups of any kind ever capture . this was really a great show , and the art work that was displayed behind the band was perfect , mysterious and a bit surreal though in a very appealing way , so the show was evocative to the ear and the eye . plus it was summertime , outside , and a river flowed quietly behind the stage as the band played . i do n't think i stopped grinning through the whole set . that said i was somewhat disappointed with this dvd as it just did n't match my own memory of this show . the filmmaking here is just plain amateurish so as a collection of great songs this works , but as a concert artifact i think its much less succesful . that amateurism might have worked had the filmmakers simply employed handmade cameras for that would have created an improvised spontaneous feel to go along with the spontneous improvised music . the filmakers should have taken a more subdued , as well as maybe a bit more avant-garde approach , but , instead , the filmamkers got busy and decided to decorate or trash a perfectly good concert video with some unforgivably cheesy and painfully obvious special effects and visual metaphors ( traffic lights , time-lapse highway travel , traffic ) which were nowhere near as subtle and evocative as the graphics that adorned the stage . these 'special ' effects were just not that special , and they give the video all of the visual mystery and excitement of a local televison commercial . the idea , apparently , was to share with the dvd audience the feel of traveling with the band but the filmmakers seem to forget that what we want to watch over and over is not the interviews and sound bites and jump-cuts to band members getting on tour buses or hanging out in hotel rooms ( unless its a band that is doing something that we want to see like say the stones in '72 ) but these guys when offstage just seem like ordinary guys who are not really interested in tearing it up . the music itself is what counts , the musicians say so themselves , and thats what we want too , the music . lets face it winwood is a genius onstage ( so long as he 's surrounded by great players that allow him to jam ) but a dynamic off-stage presence he 's not , so he 's just not that interesting to follow around . capaldi , on the other hand , has great camera presence and his character and humor really come across . his mugging for the camera is on occasion pretty funny . but , on several occasions , the filmakers cut-away from musical jams in progress in order to give us more of this stuff and this is sheer madness . when you buy a live album or a live dvd ( especially one of a band that is known for its awesome jam potential ) the one thing that you do not want is for those jams to be interrupted or edited or interefered with in any way . this music is sacred so light up , enjoy , and leave it alone . really not cool of the vidoegraphers to cut-away mid-jam ever for any reason ! note to future concert vidoegraphers : keep camera focused on the band , watching them play is plenty of entertainment . if you want to cut-away occasionally to show crowd shots thats fine so long as its a shot of a dancing girl soaking-up-the-music-and-sun , but no cut-aways that involve cutting songs short ( as these filmmakers do in the middle of `` glad '' ) . also probably would have been best to leave jerry garcia out of the `` dear mr. fantasy '' sequence , jerry just was n't feeling the song , so why do we need to watch jerry not feelin ' all that alright . i love jerry but i do n't want a video record of this particular moment which was not one of his best . i am guessing that this dvd was the work of more than one filmmaker because occasionally it does achieve that ground level and grassroots feel that we want from a live performance that we attended and have more than fond memories of . of course the people we see at the concert on this video are not the ones we saw when we were there ( our own absence from the procedings is maybe why concert videos always seem to be mssing some key ingredient ) but it is nice to be reminded that part of the concert experience is what happens before the show , and what happens offstage in the audience during the show while sitting on the grass among strangers who are nonetheless feeling the vibe along with ya . no better show opener than `` pearly queen '' and no better show closer than the traffic version ( complete with long drum build up ) of `` gim me some lovin ' '' ..... lots of good stuff inbetween as well ... '' 40,000 headmen '' & `` john barleycorn '' ..... at the show i saw i do seem to remember hearing `` empty pages '' and `` dream gerard '' in addition to the rest of the set list on this dvd . so , what 's up videographers ? by the way these performances sound virtually identical to the live versions of these songs on welcome to the canteen and that is not a bad thing since that is one of the best live albums i 've ever heard . if you are new to traffic and do n't really want or need a concert dvd but want to experience the live traffic then welcome to the canteen is the way to go . canteen has `` pearly queen '' and `` medicated goo '' as well as `` 40,000 headmen '' and `` dear mr. fantasy '' and gim me some lovin ' '' but it also has three dave mason songs so you get `` feelin ' alright '' , `` should n't have took more than you gave '' , and `` sad and deep as you .

not only is pink an amazing singer , but her lyrics are soo deep and personal . i love people who write about the sad times because a lot of people needs to hear something they can relate to . family potrait speaks to a lot of people , including my brother , who overhead the song and keeps requesting me to replay track <NUM> . the whole album is a work of art so it 's hard to choose , but if i had to choose , my favorites are do n't let me get me , just like a pill , family potrait and lonely girl . pink 's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice . once you listen to this album , you will want hear more . so i will go ahead and let you know that her third album is try this and her fourth , which is her best thus far is `` i 'm not dead '' . so please give this album a chance . pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself .
i dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to the killers new sound and look , i for one love it ! by the 3rd time i heard the album , i knew there was no way i 'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time , just like hot fuss . the songs are great , the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection .
very technical book with a great overview about energy and hydrocarbons in particular . i would not recommend this book as a first book about peak oil , this book is definately written for an audience that has more of a scientific background , but if you are concerned about the phenomenon of peak oil and have the ability to grasp basic scientific concepts , then this book is excellent . not so much political as some of the other peak oil books , deffeyes is a second generation petroleum man and a university professor . he deals with the fundamental aspects of peak oil as it relates to oil as a natural resource . still , i believe that this book is essential reading to anyone trying to come to grips with the idea of peak oil and i highly recommend this book to all concerned people that can deal with the basic science involved . peak oil is a fact , and everyone needs to understand the reasons why the human race needs to reduce our consumption of oil as soon as possible
don knotts is a classic . as hokey as this movie may be , it is great for the whole family . it brought back some of my youth , ( not a lot , but some ) .the use of the live action and animation was well done . the dvd quality was excellent .
it was in june of <NUM> that classic rock legends the eagles released their self-titled debut album , which was a great blend of pop , rock and country . drummer don henley , bass player randy meisner , guitarist bernie leadon and guitarist/keyboardist glenn frey would finally have the chance to prove to the world that they were musical geniuses whom not only could play well but sing so well with harmonies that were flawless after first playing together in legendary country/rock/pop singer linda ronstadt 's backing band and after they finished the tour with linda she blessed the guys to break out on their own and the band did n't forget her and she subsequently signed to asylum thanks to the eagles ' success . the band has since this debut became the best-selling american band of all time , and is also one of the top <NUM> ahead of pink floyd and behind only led zeppelin and the beatles . this debut album was produced and engineered by glyn johns , the same man responsible for engineering albums by the who , led zeppelin , the rolling stones , the faces and the beatles among others . the heavily country-influenced take it easy opens this stellar album and was a great intro to the eagles . the rock classic witchy woman follows and was the world 's intro to henley 's voice which would become more dominant in later albums ( he would also sing the rocking nightingale ) . the rocking chug all night follows and has superb vocals from glenn . randy steps out in front for the ballad most of us are sad which is a great song . the aforementioned nightingale follows and is a great rocker . the second half kicks off with guitarist bernie 's country tinged train leaves here this morning and is a great song . the countryish-rocker take the devil is chilling with a great meisner vocal . the country-ish earlybird follows and has bernie on vocals and just is a great number . the slower but still excellent tune peaceful easy feeling follows and was the album 's other hit single . the album closes with the rocker tryin which was one of randy 's best vocal performances . this album has held up well and this was the last eagles album i bought in <NUM> when i was <NUM> on cassette and regretted not acquiring it earlier as i thought the album would stink aside from the three singles which are on the various best ofs ( take it easy , witchy woman and peaceful easy feeling ) . this album is a classic and is highly recommended !
there are plenty of christmas cds by bing crosby that you could get , most of them are at least as good if not slightly better than this one . however , one very good thing about this cd is that it provides bing crosby in very good voice singing christmas standards at an excellent price . these recordings were from old radio shows , and , while that means that there is a mild radio hiss in the background . i personally think that this adds a little magic and character to the cd . if you agree and are on a somewhat limited budget , then you should definitely think about adding this crosby classic to your christmas collection
i live in thailand and have traveled to burma ( sometimes called & quot ; myanmar & quot ; ) . i was prepared to like this book and i was expecting the heroic life story that i got . i was not , however , prepared for the beauty of the writing and the depth of the tragedy so simply , but touchingly , told . it is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language ; thwe is very talented . i hope that he keeps writing . i also hope that in his next book , he drops some of the reserve that characterizes his cultural upbringing and lets us into his inner life a little more
i do n't really love this cd but one song on there really called out to me and it was `` when somebody loves you '' i love that song .
my aunt recently came to visit me and strongly suggested i read your `` do n't eat the marshmallow ... yet ! '' book along with the motivational mini book . since reading the book ( just two days ago ) , one effect your book had on me was to set up a savings account that will transfer funds from my checking account twice a month . my aunt , along with your book , also inspired me use passages and quote some lines that i am using for my midterm paper . i wanted to thank you for the inspiration and additional motivation ( that i yes needed ! ) . i am continuing the domino effect and am recommending this book to my friends and even my boss . i will continue re-reading this book and adopt the marshmallow theory/delayed gratification as my own . i strongly believe this has provided a positive change in my life that i will repeatedly profit from
this collection is older , but it 's <NUM> tracks long , and does include most of the essential roxy/ferry songs . included amongst all these killer songs is `` love is the drug '' , `` more than this '' , `` avalon '' , and `` slave to love '' . it would truly be impossible to fit everything on one disc , but the only things i really miss is roxy 's `` mother of pearl '' , and ferry 's `` kiss and tell '' and `` limbo '' . otherwise it actually does a great job as a `` best of '' . this being currently out of print however , you may have to hit the used stores , or deal with another `` hits '' album .
a great collection of arts solo stuff , which include his <NUM> brillant chart no one ` s & quot ; i only have eyes for you & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; bright eyes. & quot ; there is quite a few songs off & quot ; the art garfunkel album & quot ; such as the romantic & quot ; i believe when i fall in love it ` ll be for ever & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; <NUM> miles from l.a. & quot ; & quot ; watermark & quot ; from the album from the same name . but surprisingly only a a couple of tracks , from the very well put together album & quot ; fate for breakfast. & quot ; all in all it ` s a great album , with a great selection of songs . so if you like chill out tunes , after a stressful day , buy this album . i can guantee , it will de-stress you

i read this one for the first time in <NUM> , a year after it was published . this story has never left me . for some reasone it left quite an impression . recently i ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it , took it home and read it again . i now know why it has stayed with me all these year ! it is good ! i have , over the years read quite a number of heinlein 's works and i must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch . i realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader , but , as i just found out , it is quite a nice read for the older reader also . as i remember , looking back , this book rather inspired me in many ways , and doing better in school was by no means the least . some of heinlein 's later work was rather difficult for me to digest , i.e . i simply did not like them . i rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one . recommend this one highly .
all i can say is that the product was sent on time with no hassle . the person i gave it to was quite pleased !
bruno nuytten 's film on the life and times of camille claudel ( isabelle adjani ) and her mentor/lover auguste rodin ( gerard depardieu . ) a well directed film that follows the female artist 's humble beginnings as rodin 's assistant and lover to her later achievements as a great sculptress and artist . the film focuses on camille 's development as a character rather than being a shallow biographical film of her work . the film explores her relationship with rodin and how his infidelities led her to feel used and abandoned . the film shows how her parting with rodin opened the doors of her creativity and talent as a sculptress in her own right . the film closely associates her genius as an artist with her mental disintegration until she is confined to a mental asylum in the later part of her life . this is a great film and both adjani and depardieu play their roles very well . the film is a careful psychological study of both artists and what inspired their talents in making such great works of art . i strongly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in art , history , or just good drama
gantz is a tense , emotion wringing story with a lot of blood and a side portion of sex . unless you are very tolerant of hardship , blood and sex this is n't for young children . parents wo n't want their children to watch these episodes until they are <NUM> , teenagers will love watching the show when they are <NUM> and perhaps even a bit younger and will miraculously be totally unharmed except being exposed to a couple of interesting ideas . ideas ( certainly not comprehensive ) : <NUM> ) what happens after you die could be heaven or hell , could be nothing , or it could be something else entirely that no one has considered before <NUM> ) young men tend to be more horny than have sense . ( amazing how for some reason this just is n't projected most times there are teenagers around ) <NUM> ) materialist idea of 'you ' or ' i ' . it appears that almost all of the characters in the show are 'captured ' at the time of their death and recorded and transported to gantz . this either implies that the soul is recordable and recreatable or that the soul is unnecessary in the recreation of a person . <NUM> ) the weaponry appears to be fairly original . kei kurono is certainly the most interesting character in the series . he can be annoying and is certainly obsessed with sex , but i think that merely makes him a relatively accurrate depiction of a teenage male . one of the key points in this very violent series is that violence is real and although the activities in the gantz games are certainly violent , you ca n't get away from violence even in a place that should be safe like home . this is demonstrated by kato 's little brother being beaten by their aunt that is taking care of them because their parents are dead . the effects of violence at home , rather than violence in the gantz activities are what appear to motivate kato to incredible rages . kato , who is the most reasoning character in the series . kato , who is unable to kill in order to survive or even protect his friends - is driven by the violence at home and school to beat people insensible . the series is neat . not all questions are answered in the first series . nor , i suspect are they answered completely in the second season . some questions perhaps we do not have the answers . some answers are held in the manga and possibly japanese anime versions of the show . i hope they continue to produce gantz anime , and perhaps some of those answers will be revealed . perhaps it will be like the original guyver series . one of the best anime i 've watched and i was horrified that the end , was in fact the end . clearly a show ( just as gantz ) that there is plently of material to continue the story . while i 'd love to continue reading the story in the manga , it appears to currently not be available in english . i will hope that people will be able to watch this show and not be put off by the sex and violence contained within it - just as they are contained in real life . it certainly provided me with a nice diversion . oh , and yes , i hate the fact that there are only <NUM> episodes per disk . who makes that kind of decision ? i have anime with <NUM> episodes per disk , <NUM> episodes per disk but most commonly <NUM> episodes per disk . do n't waste resources people ! <NUM> episodes could have easily fit on <NUM> disks compared to <NUM> ! the extra disks , cost to the manufacturer , extra materials for disk holders and the large box - man - it just makes sense to shave some cents off the cost of the series and sell it for the same amount and make more money than waste all those disks with <NUM> episodes each . blech . good thing i really like the series . atheists , agnostics and secular humanists will probably enjoy this series as well as people who are fairly moderate in temperance . folks that take their religion too seriously , do n't like anime , do n't like sex or feel that there is too much violence on tv - need not apply . funny how this is a japanese animation , with so much blood , guts and sex and they have lower incidences of violence in their country than in the usa . must not be the violence and sex on tv that causes the problems , folks ! if blood , guts and sex on tv causes it in reality then japan must be overrun with roving gangs , rapes and thousands of murders , but we know this is not true
blood in , blood out ( a.k.a . `` bound by honor '' ) is a bit of a surprise . while it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film , it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there . for example , this film has the best location shots of east l.a . i think i 've ever seen , and the whole movie has the look of authenticity . this is no illusion ; the prison scenes were filmed in san quentin , and there are only eight actors used for them . this adds interest as you try to spot the `` real '' actors behind bars . ( hint : the convict who looks like billy bob thornton is billy bob thornton . ) another one of the non-cons is hispanic poet jimmy santiago baca ; he plays the member of la onda with a heavily pruned mustache . baca co-wrote this screenplay , and it 's clear that he 's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film . that 's not to the project 's detriment , but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed . in other words , this movie 's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going . perhaps this is intentional ; blood in , blood out means it 's hard to get in the gang , and it 's not easy bailing from it either ; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie . and just like joining a gang , you 're making a real commitment here , as the film is well over three hours long . ( in its original form , it was well over five hours long ! ) sidelight : i 've never heard `` ese '' ( pronounced `` ess-ay '' ) so many times in my life ; be sure to have the subtitles on to understand the spanglish slang .
it 's a movie as morally complex as the history of america itself . yes , the town , lago , has blood on its hands . yes , the townspeople have flirted with evil by having three common thugs bullwhip their sheriff to death because he would likely report their mine as located on federal lands and so endanger their ambitions for limitless wealth . yet , the movie also appears to see the town , lago , as worthy of redemption . after railroading the thugs into prison , the town very conveniently proceeds to pretend that nothing ever happened : `` these are god fearing people , '' the new sheriff earnestly tells the high plains drifter . however , when the thugs are released from prison , they seek to receive their back wages in the blood of the townspeople who doublecrossed them . only when the townspeople experience the same terror that their bullwhipped sheriff must have experienced does the high plains drifter reappear to save them from the thugs . indeed , at the end of movie , when the high plains drifter rides away from town on horseback , a tombstone is erected with the name of the murdered sheriff . unlike the outlaws , the townspeople feel a very real sense of collective guilt , which the high plains drifter and their ordeal have reawakened . perhaps that is the hope of america -- that we do have guilt over our past and we do not just pretend that nothing ever happened .
this is one of my favorite movies ! tom ewell is a hoot as richard sherman , a man with an overactive imagination . we do n't believe him for a minute when he swears to himself he is not going to smoke , drink , etc . while his wife and son are away because we know he does n't have the will power . he really wants these things , yet seven years of marriage has ingrained his wife 's nagging into his conscience . his wife 's voice is always there and he is now no longer able to go through a day and complete simple tasks without constantly grappling with himself for permission . and then marilyn monroe moves in upstairs for the summer . is there no mercy ? monroe and ewell are great , wilder keeps up the pace and the supporting parts are spot-on . wonderful ! the picture has been restored and is presented widescreen , so you can not go wrong .
i thought this one was hilarious my favorite episode was squrille jokes . spongebob does stand up at the krusty krab.his first few lokes were lousy so spongebob starts looking around for anything to make a joke about and he sees sandy the squrille and he makes fun of her so every one thinks she is dumb . i thought it was so funny . i think everyone should get this movie if there a spongebob fan . and adults if you think im not going to waste money on a talking sponge and listen to his kiddy jokes . well you should get it cause there is a lot of jokes that kids dont understand but adults do
i truly enjoyed listening to the cd , especially the arrangement of wrapped up , tied up , tangled up and just for who you are . earnest is leading us into worship and pouring out his heart . may god continue to bless and keep him . md / concord churc
how is it that the oakland a 's have won the al west in <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> ( and are all but assured of winning this year , <NUM> ) , as well as the wild card in <NUM> , even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll ? that is the narrative that michael lewis uses to tell the story of his book moneyball . one of the central tenets of moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued , can , with some specificity , predict certain players ' performances in certain areas . it is , however , only half the story , and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you , old news . the real story that moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up . lewis repeatedly describes how the old boys club of major league owners ( who lewis affectionately refers to as the women 's auxiliary ) , players , and journalists ( former cincinnati red and current espn commentator joe morgan is appropriately skewered ) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like billy beane ( the book 's main protagonist and current a 's gm ) , bill james , dick cramer , and others . and on the old boys club the point is lost : that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who can not afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players , the best chance of winning . when people point to the fact that the a 's have not won the world series since <NUM> in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years ( roughly since <NUM> ) is when moneyball makes its point .
house is the best show on television . there 's never been a medical show like this - ever , and i 've seen just about all of them . and to have someone of hugh laurie 's caliber and immense talent is such a great treat for viewers . there is nothing this man ca n't do . brilliant and genius are overused words , but in his case , they more than apply . his background in so many british comedies prepared him well for the role of house , but what 's so amazing is how he can go from making you laugh one minute , to playing pain and drama like nobody 's business . the dvd 's are so clear and sharp , and those mesmerizing blue eyes of his are just mind boggling ! when the light hits them a certain way , you can not look at anything or anyone else in the scene . hugh , if you 're reading this i know you hate hearing it , but you are brilliant and sexy as hell ! ! ! ! the best show on television , bar none
think pokemon is cool ? of course you do . well electric shock showdown and battle aboard the st. anne are some of the best . for true pokemon fans it was very exciting to see pikachu vs. raichu . team rocket begins to worry after the first match that pikachu lost , that pikachu was n't as valuable as they thought and should persue other villainess deeds , but in the end with an ability not known to raichu , pikachu , the underdog , comes out on top again . when team rocket henchmen try to capture a ship load of pokemon trainers ' pokemon , the trainers join forces putting charmander with charmander and geodude with geodude to force rocket off the ship but then a storm results in the evacuation and capsizing of the ship ash must find and get back his first captured pokemon , butterfree , and james to get back a majikarp he squanderd his and jesse 's money on , however the ship sinks with him and his friends trapped in side ..
great song . i love patti smith 's version but this one 's even better . that song alone is worth however much you pay for this album . plus you get other rare gems ( and great bruce songs ) such as fire , seeds and paradise by the `` c '' ( great title ! ) , not to mention killer versions of bruce classics such as rosalita , born to run , thunder road , badlands , darkness on the edge of town , the river , independence day , etc . whether you 're a completist or a huge fan of the boss ( i fall in the latter camp ) , you really should pick this up .
i was introduced to sissel through a recent trip to norway . she has a voice of an angel ! through buying this cd , which i listen to in the car on the way to and from work , for a relaxing mood , i have been introduced to her other cd 's . wish they were more available in the usa . i really enjoy this album
after listening to this cd a couple times , i will be keeping it on my ipod playlist for some time . it will come in quite handy when i want to drown out the voices of people with `` single phase '' minds ! yes , it is supposed to be relaxing ! comparing this to muzak is nothing short of ignorant ! on a better note , i would tend to agree that peter white is creative when it comes to mixing up his sound with other artists . yet another reason to really appreciate the jazz community . if you are a peter white fan , you will not be let down .
this is morricone at the height of his career . here he created a score as mysterious and ethereal as the jungles and waterfalls depicted in the film `` the mission . '' using a combination of flutes , oboes , strings , choral and other odd wind instruments , morricone created both a unique and haunting experience that will leave you spellbound long after the last notes have faded from the air . the score could almost be classifed as a requiem , in this case a tribute to a people that are gone ( the guarani natives depicted in this film who were long ago driven from their homes ) and the jesuits who gave their lives to protect them . from the opening scene of the film , the score announces itself as the dominant character in the narrative , taking us from the lonely plight of a missionary on a cross , to the streets of colonial asuncion , to the mist shrouded rain forest above the falls and the fateful mission where lives and beliefs will be tested to the core , combining native motifs with deep and sweeping string movements to fill in the places in the story where actors and the dialogue are silent , allowing the music to bring us down into an intimate place of reflection where we can embrace the sadness and the transformation that this film evokes . the only piece that i can compare this work to is richard strauss ' `` death and transfiguration , '' both works leave me shaken and nearly moved to tears . however , it 's a deeply rewarding feeling to come in contact with works as profound as these . buy `` the mission '' and you will find yourself instantly transported to a place as rare as the bygone world the film depcits .
alan silvestri does great work when writing for action films and this really shows his unique talents . the main theme for the volcano itself is a <NUM> note low brass motif used frequently throughout . parts of the score are similar to eraser in instrumentation and orchestrations . one thing i was not too impressed with was the sound recording . it is a decent recording , but the overall sound is low and you have to crank up the volume to really hear it good . the best cue of them all is the thrilling `` march of the lava '' which includes all of the main elements of the score , with strong low brass rhythms , pulsating brass trills , ostinato strings , and driving , militaristic snare drums . `` team work '' and `` build a wall '' are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass , especially those trombone shrill sounds that elliot goldenthal has been known to use . `` main title '' is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme , but instead uses a light <NUM> note theme that you never hear again . some romantic , dramatic music appears in the final track `` cleansing rain '' to bring the score to a close . overall , a great action score that serves both the film and your cd player well
this movie is hilarious . it is jennifer aniston 's best movie to date . she normally bombs in every movie imo , but here is the perfect role for her . ben stiller is so funny as ruben . the bathroom scene had me in tears i laughed so hard
this is a nice cd and should provide hours of listening enjoyment . i had been waiting for this cd to come out and i an not in the least bit disappointed
prepare to start hyperventilating as you read this book if you have only been exposed to the `` official '' version of 9/11 . read it , and you may never again be able to stomach the words `` war on terror . '' without throwing bricks , without partisan pot-shots , dr. griffin methodically lays out evidence which overwhelmingly suggests u.s. government complicity in the 9/11 attacks . yet , to his credit , all the author asks for is a genuine , in-depth , and independent investigation . ( the 9/11 commission provided nothing of the sort , but that 's the topic of his next book , `` the 9/11 commission report : omissions and distortions '' ) part of what makes `` the new pearl harbor '' compelling is that it cites so many reports from mainstream media -- newsweek , the washington post , the new york times , etc . quotes from these `` reliable '' sources appear in copious endnotes that together create a pattern . major media just has n't connected the dots . ( this , perhaps , is because its owned by people and corporations who profit handsomely from war . ) but in crime-busting <NUM> , we learn to suspect those who benefit most from a crime . could our government be so monstrous as to sacrifice 3,000 of its own citizens to secure hundreds of billions of dollars in war funding for many years to come ? our military trains leaders to think in terms of `` cost benefit . '' securing a new american century of `` full-spectrum domination , '' to them , may be the prize that justifies such an atrocity . these and many other questions beg serious probing , not knee-jerk ridicule and dismissive labels like `` unpatriotic . '' read this book , pass it on , and demand that congress start answering questions ; many of the official aspects of 9/11 simply do n't add up
the best parts of the lost painting : the quest for a caravaggio masterpiece , by jonathan harr , deal with the artist himself . when most artists are considered eccentric , caravaggio was a renegade in his actions . a fighter . he killed a man , and lived his last years on the run . many of his paintings were initially discounted , but his popularity grew in later years . i enjoyed the book , and found the idea of these lost masterpieces , valued in the tens of millions of dollars , to be out there somewhere very fascinating . four stars & recommended .
this is a love story personified . and i am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day . this is what love really is . . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part . and i do not believe it ends there . so if you want to know what love really is - watch this movie or read the book . it is fantastic
what an amazing album ! and who saw it coming ? jon anderson 's work here is the best , but there certainly is other great talent , especially on the last song . most of the lyrics are in elvish , but there 's some in english , too . the only real downpoint is the cover of `` battle of evermore '' pales in comparison to the original song . all in all , this accompanies tolkien 's work fabulously . one little weak spot keeps it from getting a <NUM>
this was used as the primary textbook for my senior seminar as a religion major in college . pals provides a great introduction to the major theories of religion , which we then used to help us understand the primary writings of freud , eliade , marx , durkheim , geertz and others . in the years since taking the class , this is one of the few books that i have recommended to a number of friends along the way who have been interested in learning more about religion from a philosophical/academic standpoint
whoa . seagal has just gone off in the last few years . after getting back to theaters with exit wounds in <NUM> , he made the appalling half past dead , and has now settled into his straight-to-dvd throne . the guy must be making some serious change from these movies . he 's banged out around three flicks a year since <NUM> , all so dedicated to the new formula that i can only applaud him . seriously . he just plays seagal , and he 's always an ex-secret agent , or something or other , he has the long coat to hide his wide-load body , and he whispers his words , getting dubbed in the process sometimes ( ! ) , and tries to underscore his films with a positive message about the environment , or life , or wisdom . i mean , the man was proclaimed as the reincarnation of a buddhist lama not long ago , which apparently does not conflict with his doing one cheap action flick after another for a few million . oh , and he has a band and plays blues and tours and appears in guitar magazines . what a renaissance man . i do n't remember the plot or story to this one , i only saw the last <NUM> minutes . suffice to say there are more exotic locales , another asian director , excessive use of seagal 's army of stuntmen , more shameless seagal mythology , more fat seagal in long leather coats . and yet , he is probably making more money than ever by now . after that mountain dew commercial , because we all know mountain dew is the preferred elixir of lamas everywhere , he is raking it in with these little gems . they either have a ) an asian director , b ) a rapper turned actor ( dmx , ja rule , treach , etc ) , or c ) both . the hairline retreating from his ever-expanding face , the acting still , er , bad , the action still incoherent due to editing that masks the fact that seagal ca n't do any stunts ( except for the one where he finishes off an ihop grand slam breakfast in seconds ) , you know what you 're going to get . idiotic 'entertainment ' and a damn good laugh , even a cry for how far the large man has fallen . no doubt this and two or three other flicks will be packaged together as a morbid dvd special
this album is fantastic . i ca n't really compare it to other melvins albums since they all have something different about them , but take my word for it that this one is great . this one is unique from every other melvins release for two reasons : <NUM> . they have a second drummer on this thing , and <NUM> . there are tons of vocal harmonies in this album . my thoughts on both : the two drummers thing , awesome , the fills and solos are amazing , i never thought they 'd find a way to make dale crover 's work even better , turns out they did , they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him . its astounding . if you play the drums , you need to hear this album . the vocal harmonies thing , really cool too . it makes the sound very unique , gives it another layer . all that said , the album itself is also unlike the other melvins albums in that most of it is really fast . the melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey , slow sound . they still toss out a few slow numbers here , but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent , speedy metal songs . and they 're awesome ! the melvins sound great playing fast ! the intro to `` the hawk '' just tears ! ! ! i do n't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album , and also , its fantastic . it rocks so hard . i mean , if you thought the maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal , check out a senile animal , its even better . i should also point out that this is probably their best starter album . meaning that if you do n't own any melvins albums and never heard of them , this one is the best place to start . i know it 's not their classic sludge sound , but the melvins are not an accessable band . their music , while intelligent , awesome , and incredibly powerful , takes a while to figure out . you have to give the melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be . take their self titled album ( or `` lysol '' to the diehards ) , for example . its a great brilliant melvins album ; one of their best , as most fans will tell you . but if you were trying to expose someone who 's never heard of the melvins to their music , you would n't dare start them out with lysol , it would go right over their heads . so thats why its nice to see a melvins album like `` a senile animal '' come out , becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there , but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around . so thank you , melvins , for making yet another wonderful , unique , challenging-yet-still-accessable ( not to mention heavy ) album . and those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the melvins , buy this album . if you 're a metal fan and you have half a brain , you 'll love it . then pick up the maggot , stoner witch , and houdini . now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today , go for the golden material with gluey portch treatments , bullhead , and lysol . as a side point , how can buzz still be doing this ? its been like two decades and he 's still making some of the best metal riffs in existance . how can you go that long , putting out album after album , and still be tossing out all these fantastic , wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right ? its inhuman
this is an autobiography that describes how saadat decided to come to the knesset in the interests of egypt and the middle east . from fighting the british colonialism , arab corruption , to egyptian nationalism . a must for those who want to understand the new middle east after ww2 . also recommend his wifes book that came out after one of the most tragic assasinations in recent history .
i loved this movie it is great funny the animation war great great for every on
like finding the titanic in the backwoods of kentucky , in awe ! ! ! awesome extra dvd features , touching interviews and insight on waverly hills . it kind of freaked me out all that vile stuff thrown in the woods . if you love creepy things , this it it . well produce
i hate math , but this show has given me a great appreciation for it . th cast has great chemistry . i feel like a couple of the fbi agents when charlie is explaining a new math formula , so he puts it in layman 's terms for them ( and me ! ) . whether or not you like crime-based shows , you 'll love this
i assign this book to students in my psychology seminar . these students at a women 's college tell me that they find women and desire to be thought provoking , interesting , even helpful . i noticed a column in newsweek by anna quindlen in october . she argued that women today still need the f word feminism because society has n't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves . it appears that the need for books such as this one by polly young-eisendrath continues to be valid
this is an old movie and my daughter rented it all the time form the local video store on vhs . the store eventually removed it from their rentals . we were thrilled to find it in dvd form from amazon
i think orwell could almost sit up and cackle `` i told you so ! '' even as we gobble nachos and watch monday night football ( or pbs or fox - does n't matter ) . between the propaganda we are fed by the republican mercantilists or the democratic marxists , there is little truth . watch this film , then try to find a theater showing aaron russo 's `` america : from freedom to fascism '' . then be afraid - but not for long . get up and take action

jack nicholson goes crazy better than anyone else on screen . the film is a bit dated , but enjoyable none the less
this book was the best ! ! ! ! ! i have a book club and that was my first recommendation . it is one of the best books that i have seen about the titanic . it has a clear and easy-to-read format . plus , it has facts tahr are undescribable . they are tons of interesting facts that you can read again and again . it is a truly wonderful collection and i reccomend all to read it . such as did you know there were actually two grand staircases ? ? ? and violet jessop , former sewardess on the titanic was also on titanic 's sister ships ( britannic and olympic ) when they sank ? this is a book full of fun and facts . you will enjoy it for sur
judging by their latest release `` a murder of crows '' , incubus have ditched their funk/nu-metal/progressive/poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound . and for good reason . the moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out , and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to nu-metal usually replicate the nu-metal bands that came before them . lets face it , nu-metal is dead , and it never really was that great to begin with . incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated hip hop/funk/metal/jazz and a dj all in one package . `` morning view '' sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career . now in the lime light , with millions of fans , `` morningview '' does show the band ditching much of their hip-hop/funky roots for more mature production and compostition . the vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat . that is not to say that `` morninview '' is a less-than-stellar album , on the contrary , it is an album worth owning with much to offer . the musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful . `` morninview '' takes time to break into , and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a `` great '' radio friendly album . just like `` make yourself '' i took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song . under a new light one can easily see that `` morninview '' is one of the greatest releases of its time
this is one of the most beautiful pop-up books i have ever seen . as an adult without children , i have to say i would not want them handling it , as the work is so intricate and fragile . i would n't give this book to a child under <NUM> or so . that said , this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning . i do n't know how the authors do it but they 're amazing ! do n't hesitate to buy it ... just keep it away from your two-year-old . r-r-r-i-i-i-p ! !
romines ' study of the little house books is learned and informative . she alludes to many current discussions in literary studies . i recommend this book for the college student who is interested in children 's literature and/or women 's writing . do n't be put off by the negative reviews of readers who wanted hagiography rather than analysis
this book was a great start to my homeschooling expirience . it goes over all the myths and misconceptions and puts your mind at ease . this book was one of the first books i read about homeschooling and it was really encouraging and comforting . linda dobson writes in an easy to read fashion , like a note from a friend or big sister . i have since bought <NUM> more of her books and even more from the publishing company <NUM> rivers press . happy homeschooling !
watching this movie was like watching part <NUM> , onlything things just got a lot stranger , and we 're finally getting up close and personal with the tall man . i promise that you will be left hanging . if you are watching these films strictly because of <NUM> and <NUM> , then you may be a little dis-appointed , as this one does deliver some really good action , but not at the end , the end is more suited for those who like to read into there movies , who like the stuff with lairs , such as myself , in which case , you are going to go deep into the rabbit hole with this one ! to cater to action fans , it is said that don and bruce ( campbell ) were talking about having bruce in phantasm <NUM> and tie the evil dead franchise into it somehow , which could work considering that both of them deal with trancendence of time and space , and both seem to root themselves in the lovecraftian mythos , not to mention the fact that phantasm <NUM> and <NUM> were total evil dead , as well as bubba ho-tep which don aslo directed ! i really can not but love don 's non-sold out way of doing things . he raises the money for his love , and pours himself into it , has a lot of fun , and always delivers something well worth watching a million times over , so long as you have the patience or interest i guess , which ever . he 's a strange one ! one of the best ! : ) p.s . this movie contains a lot of flashback scenes made from un-used footage form <NUM> . a blast from the past , very cool
i wish that there would come out with the 3rd season of once and again i just love that show soooo much . i wish it was still on tv
sedaris is hillarious . the book is a compilation of short storis of his family and life history . if anyone is an amy sedaris fan and wonders how she could be so eccentric than read anything by any of the sedaris ' . `` dress your family in corduroy and denim , '' makes an entertaining leisure read . i reccomned it
a few points about the bad reviews sitting in here ... master shake shurrup you should be slapped about the room ! ! ! mathew braxmeier -- - generic emo ? ? ? i bet you have never listened to emo in your life man ... clueless whiner ! ! ! and as for a title lenght ... what would you preffer ? something short n catchy for you like 'wannabe ' by the spicegirls ? ? ? did you buy the album or just search for sum bands you probably knew you wouldnt like so that u could moan about em ? ? ? and as for jane doe -- - hhhmmmm there is the 'old favourite ' nirvana ... wow that would be amazing for sumbody to not like nirvana thesedays ... granted they did write a few good songs ... heck even spawned foo fighters after the death but jesus samuel christ ! ! ! ive yet to meet sumbody thats not in love with them ... and before you sit there and say ... aw i bet he hasnt heard anything other than smells like teen spirit and come as you are ... wrong ! i have every album ... i just choose not to listen to them to fall under the typical category of anotherone who goes with the crowd ... as for black flag , sex pistols and the misfits ... wow a little bit of taste from someone who has yet to have a little bit of variation in her taste ! ! ! move with the times jane ... all great bands in their time just as fall out is a brilliant band of this time ! ! ! every song just as catchy as the next with this album ... yet to hear how they can sound the same as afi , greenday or panic ! anyone who wants to whine send them my way ... im sure jane will i noticed the only <NUM> reviews were complete and utter moans ... buy this album ... it is sheer genius ! ! ! at the same time check out these bands guys ... - hoobastank ( new album out ) - jimmy eat world - stiff little fingers ( amazing punk band from late <NUM> 's still going at the moment and touring soon ) - flogging molly ( irish punk ) - three days grace - american hi-fi ( new album ) - yellowcard ( amazin band ) - papa roach ( still going strong ) - panic ! at the disco - <NUM> doors dow
finally some good old fashion heavy thrash metal from thrash giants the haunted . i will say that every track is amazing , it 's a non stop pulsating blast of thrash shoved down your thropat and bursting your ear drums . yes it is that good . now maybe i 've over hyped it , but i loved it that much . i have n't heard something this good since carnal forge ! for fan of carnal forge , slayer , and lamb of god , you definately must check this band out ! good musicianship , fast paced , brutal , and heavy thrash is what can be found here . a must buy
son-in-law really liked it , he is a weight lifting lover
i recall this period of neil diamond 's hits between about <NUM> and <NUM> . i still like yesterday 's songs and that smooth groove . i love september morn and its relaxing pace -- sounds like you could hear it on a quiet breezy day with the windows open . america means so much now in its patriotic theme . i still love love on the rocks -- unlike anything i heard on the radio back in <NUM> -- it 's so adventurous when i hear it . i like the rock stomp on forever in blue jeans . but let 's cut the chase to his classic duet with barbra streisand in you do n't bring me flowers . at times , it 's humorous , playful , romantic and emotional . it probably led to a huge duets boom in music in the late '70s as a lot of artists did duets . these days , the term most used is collaborations for these kinds of duets . but it 's a pretty song , one of neil 's best songs since his upbeat '60s pop . diamond 's new album `` <NUM> songs '' has been selling well and it might get him back on top like he did with these songs on volume <NUM> .
what a helpful book on understanding our past , present , and future in communication . m. rex miller is clear and precise as to the breakdown of how we have learned from ancient times and how we will learn in the future . if you are worried about postmodern thought then this is the book to read because miller shows how a new way of thinking and processing information can be very spiritually productive in a rapidly changing society and church
if you 're a hayley mills fan and a child of the 60s and 70s , then you will love this movie . it has great action , comedy , and sweet romance .
i 'm loving the cd . they have a great sound .... sensuous and chill . i first heard their music on a compilation cd . they play some of their tracks on nip/tuck too .
faith hill 's latest cd 'fireflies ' is wonderful , not necessarily because of her choice in songs , but because of her beautiful voice . i have been a fan of faith 's since the beginning and i must say her music does n't disappoint . while the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'faith ' , they are still quite good , particularly the songs written by lori mckenna . after hearing faith sing her songs , i went out and bought lori 's album 'bittertown ' , which is quite simply an incredible album . on 'fireflies ' faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song . songs that i particularly enjoy are `` stealing kisses '' , `` i want you '' , `` paris '' and `` mississippi girl '' . i 've read other reviews that said 'fireflies ' left them confused . the album 's songs do lack cohesiveness at times , but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of faith 's voice . she has , without a doubt , one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music
this is a fine creation of the <NUM> 's , with many classic songs . but we must not overlook the fact that the best song on here was not even released . it 's name : & quot ; the working hour. & quot ; check it out it is haunting
were you to read only one wodehouse book ( god forbid ) which one might it be ? i would suggest this one , although there are numerous contenders from the jeeves , drones , golf , mr. mulliner and blandings stories , not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns . although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative , being that all the tales are told in the first person by one bertie wooster , the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat `` cliffhanger '' endings , which is to say they do n't resolve . that almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel , and also spun off some of the best tv yarns in the jeeves and wooster and world of wodehouse tv series . my british edition ( for copyright reasons not for sale in the u.s. ) shows a cover photo op of ian carmichael as wooster in the bbc series `` the world of wooster '' . as pgw noted , this was one of many instances where bertie was overly mature and greyed ; there seems a deliberate attempt to make carmichael seem older -- whereas most readers , wodehouse included , see him as somewhat youngish . in wodehouse playhouse , which includes brief vignettes of pgw , he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting bertie somewhat younger . even better was the stellar performance in jeeves and wooster , in which `` pearls mean tears '' `` comrade bingo '' and a number of these other chapters , expanded into episodes , appear . no wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read
i 've read the left behind series twice , and , both times , i blazed through 'armageddon ' . in my honest opinion , it was one of the best in the series . why ? simply due to logical progression . when one of the main characters make a stupid and fatal mistake , we are taken on a journey with them . when another one of the 'heroes ' makea stupid move in judgment , we are taken on the journey with them . when one of the longtime main characters in the series decides to step into the warzone , he is not in the middle of some act of god that will save his life . armageddon is simply one of the wildest books in the series and relies on very little , if any , use of deus ex machina to bail out the stupid main characters . true , the writing is still simple and the characters even simpler , but by this point , you should alreayd know that . the thing about armageddon that makes it so good is the pace it moves . it 's both frenetic and painstaking at the same time . how is this possible ? because we are constantly switching from different points of view . however , each one of them is an ordeal of suffering ( especially for the haters of lb that have stupidly stuck with the story for so long ... either they have no life , are very , very hopeful , or are too ashamed to admit that they , too , love this story ) . bottom line - things happen in this book . after the turd that was 'the remnant ' , where virutally nothign of note happened , 'armageddon ' puts all the pieces on the board for the final battle in 'glorious appearing ' . i should also mention that the title may be a bit misleading . this book simply introduces armageddon , and the first few battle of the great war ; 'glorious appearing ' is the grand finale where it all happens . in any case , thumbs way up for 'armageddon '
this is a great album , my favourite . let 's go to tahiti , friday , thirteen days , do n't cry sister , sensitive kind . this was made for cd , <NUM> years to early . okay i like jj , but this to me is the peak . and eric clapton has n't covered a single track of this
this is a great collection of hits . it 's great to be able to buy these cds where you like every song on the cd and not just one -- that 's why i but the collections of hits , but then you ca n't go wrong with alan jackson
i am a very big fan of the o.c but i must admit that it is getting worse and worse i hate to say this cause really like it but i hope it gets better . whats making it worse is that a lot is happening in one episode and the hero is always rayen . well lets hope for the best i cant wait for the next season since the finale was a real clif hanger
if you liked the original ones , get them all . these are just as enjoyable
rita vogt ( bibiana beglau ) is one of a group of west german terrorists who spring fellow terrorist , andrea ( harald schrott ) from jail . several people are shot during the jailbreak , and the group goes on the lam to paris . while in paris , rita kills a policeman , and the terrorists are once again on the run -- this time they slip into east germany with the help of stasi officer erwin hull ( martin wuttke ) who befriended rita when she was recognized upon entering east berlin before . since the heat is on the group , erwin makes an offer -- the terrorists can accept a new life -- with new identities in east germany , or they can be flown out to beirut . while everyone else elects beirut , rita decides to stay in east germany . rita assumes a new identity in east germany , and her adjustment to her environment is at the heart of `` the legend of rita '' from director volker schlondorff . the plot places rita in some interesting situations . her first job , for example , is in a factory where she befriends tatjana ( nadja uhl ) . tatjana loathes east germany , and would love to live in the west . she ca n't understand why rita ( now living under an assumed name ) would give up western freedoms and chose to live under communist rule . in the meantime , rita 's former rebelliousness against the state has simply disappeared , and she 's become a drone -- speaking the party line and accepting whatever she 's told to do . when rita 's new identity is threatened , she has little choice but to move on -- leaving tatjana and their budding lesbian affair . the film fails to fulfill its promise , however , on several layers . rita becomes a pawn for the stasi -- every move she makes is watched , and every conversation she has is taped . the film could have chosen to tackle some fascinating complex arguments -- rita 's ideology , for example , and the challenge she faces in either rejecting her beliefs or sticking to them in the face of such nauseating , and threatening orwellian bureaucracy . the plot shows rita as mindlessly accepting what she is told to do -- she does n't question her freedoms , and by making rita a drone , she is a far less interesting character . instead , the film concentrates on rita 's two love interests . also , if you are expecting to discover something about the red army faction ( raf ) here , keep looking . this is not a film about the raf . there is an excellent book by stefan aust on the subject , but it 's rare to find a copy in english . i recommend `` how it all began '' by bommi baumann and `` televisionaries : the red army faction story 1963-1993 '' by tom vague . `` the legend of rita '' is worth watching for all fans of german film out there . overall , the film 's message argues strongly against aligning oneself with any political ideals . in german with english subtitles -- displacedhuma
i do n't understand a lot of the criticism of the yes men by other reviewers . i mean , all the right-wing reviews are to be expected ( `` flaming '' is what amazon 's user reviews are all about is n't it ? ! ) . so , obviously , that 's a given . but all the <NUM> and <NUM> star people who were like `` i did n't find it funny '' and `` too much talking '' and what not , that 's what i do n't get . i found the movie terribly funny . even the benign banter whilst driving around or prepping i found funny . but the scene where they present in `` the suit '' ... man , i was almost crying it was so funny . and as for the `` what 's the point ! ? '' criticisms , all i can say is : by that logic , what 's the point of anything ? i mean , what do you want ? it 's a movie ? the best it can hope for is to inspire the viewer . in this case either to act , or to possibly feel like there is a little bit of hope in the world since the only audience to challenge their right-wing , lassie fare , free-unmitigated-trade-to-the-max insanity are the college kids ( aka the future policy makers ) , and because the one time they present the more positive ideas of the left , their audience of economists ( who you 'd expect to hate it ) all express such joy at someone finally taking a stand for what they know to be right , but never get to talk about . if this is the gauge by which you judge success or failure of what a film should do , i think it succeeds admirably . in short , i thought the yes men was very funny . on netflix ( where * accurate * star ratings are helpful , not silly ones , like in this venue ) , i gave it <NUM> stars . i gave it <NUM> here because i want to try to offset some of the <NUM> star people
ranks with jerry kramer 's `` instant replay '' as one of the most insightful books about the nfl . a time when love of the game was as important as ( if not more than ) the money
joshs song `` to where you are '' was written for his grama after her death . i just lost my grama and this was the song that was sung at the chaple . it is a beautiful song that shows the love for a family member , i 'm buying the cd , so that my grama will always be close to me
i had never read anything by anna quindlen before so this was my first book . i will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author . the story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit . i am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic , fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world .
i found this book interesting not only for its overview of the life and career of tiger flowers but for the broader look at how athletes , especially black athletes , had to cope with the pressure of the public eye in the south in the early 20th century
this is a great workout as a whole ( or more than one segment at least ) . michelle dozois ( shape dvd 's ) is energetic and enthusiastic without going overboard . she is motivating and cues very well . the five segments are slow and steady burn , carb killer , power blast , interval burn and metabolism booster . the thing i like about this is that you can customise your own workout or do them in order . there 's great music to also keep you motivated and give you a good workout routine . the only problem is that you really should do a minimum of two workouts in a row or you wo n't get as much benefit as possible . one segment is fine on it 's own if you are topping up from another routine you do . but overall , i think everyone will like this because it 's great if you are short on time and because you can mix it up , it does n't get boring . i love it
genevieve ( jenny-v ) is a damn good read , and i ca n't believe some of you all are rating it <NUM> to <NUM> stars . everyone has an opinion , so that 's why i beg to differ . this book kept me on the edge with its home-town drama . i would occasionally rub the old lady 's leg when i got to those good parts . i became so wrapped up into this dialogue , i could hear the voices , smell the cigarettes , touch ... well , that was the old lady . i loved it . mr. dickey is a great writer and i plan to buy every book that he writes in the future . unless he starts to get flakey and starts writing about aliens . that 's my two cents
i always love william finn , and 25th annual putnam county spelling bee is no exception . the show is full of funny character songs like `` i 'm not that smart '' and `` woe is me , '' but it also has real show pieces with `` the i love you song '' and `` my favorite moment of the bee . '' this show perfectly highlights finn 's ability to create quirky comedies with big hearts . it seems to always be in my cd player
the perfect album for after work ; this music really compliments that first wonderful moment when you kick off your shoes , ease your chair back ... and relax with a cocktail after a hard day . chet is my relaxation hero
outstanding book for all beatles lovers . great and accurate scores . lots of fun
following is a <NUM> part review consisting of : <NUM> ) intro and recommendations <NUM> ) point location review <NUM> ) meridian review <NUM> ) action/indications review <NUM> ) i am a first year acupuncture student at bastyr university . we have been using this text as the primary book for our meridians and points class . it is a good text ( one of the best out there for point location ) , and it is always undergoing revisions ( got to love an author dedicated to his subject ) . i also recommend the flash cards as a quick reference ( a lot easier to carry around ) and trail guide to the body by andrew biel ( isbn:0965853454 ) to supplement your education . <NUM> ) a manual of acupuncture is strong on point location with good images to help with quick reference . only a few discrepancies contained within the text . deadman usually gives clear anatomical descriptions in the text that will get you even more precisely to the point than the picture . there are a lot of quick ways to find a point , a few of them even work , luckily deadman stays away from most of them and chooses to give you good accurate descriptions that will be true all the time under normal circumstances . -- pet peeve exception : li-4 location note gives an unclear description of using the `` bulge of the muscle '' to find the point . this quick trick will have you needling in random directions in random places ( some of them hurt ! ) . the refined version of this trick can actually be helpful ... <NUM> . passively adduct the patient 's thumb so that it contacts the palmar surface of the index finger . <NUM> . with the hand radial side up put your finger on the highest point of the bulge ( this will be near the end of the crease ) . <NUM> . release the thumb and let your finger sink down as the bulge disappears -- there you go ! after all , if you are using tricks on the major points of the body you need to make sure they work on most of the people most of the time ; the rest of the time refer to deadman 's excellent text . <NUM> ) meridians are given clearly with detailed text . though our instructor subscribes to a slightly different theory for some of the fine points here and there , overall i have no complaints . again , i love the illustrations in this book . <NUM> ) basic actions are given , but without much explanation of the mechanism ( thank you kyo for breaking that down ) ; the long list of indications and a solid understanding of chinese medicine ( or good instructor ) will get you on your way to figuring out possible mechanisms . once you understand the theory it will eliminate the confusion initially created by a long list of indications . references are good , but you must always look beyond it an figure out why/for whom/under what conditions that prescription was written ; otherwise you will be trapped by ancient dogma and modern conditions .
this book is a wonderful examination of the social history of knitting . knitting for family has always been a requirement of any woman . but , this book revels how woman across america knitted items in support of the revolutionary war , the war of <NUM> , wwi and wwi . in fact , there is currently a program to knit scarves in support of operation enduring freedom . knitting for charity is also discussed . when our governments can not , or will not , provide for the needy ; american 's women have
i have had this videocassette for years and its so worn i 'm so glad to finally get a cd ! jewel 's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like joy to the world and o little town of bethlehem are the best versions i have ever heard . i could have done without the non-traditional songs which do n't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for gloria , o holy night and ave maria . if you like to sing along , i highly recommend it .
considering netrebko 's and villazon 's age- both are in their thirties- the maturity and command of their artistry is constantly moving ahead of their years . villazon , with all the bells and whistles of his top ringing notes , has becomes the spinto/italianate tenor extraordinaire of our time that gives us glimpses- although i hate to make comparisons- of correlli and di stefano . netrebko , as a soprano , is in a league of her own . her voice in any new recording sounds better than in her last one . the lyricim , color and communicating power of her singing trancends vulnerability , despair and hopelessness that are so well portayed in mimi 's duet . some bloggers hate netrebko 's guts and claim hype for her success . that 's a cop out . you can not sell out opera houses all over the world , and cds that have surpassed in numbers many classical recording of the past , based only on hype . there must be a substantive voice behind a beautiful face and body . i love and i know opera well , and i 've seen , live , many of the great sopranos of past forty years . and if i 'm flying across the u.s.a. to see netrebko at her carnegie hall debut- i was lucky to find one of the last tickets- is not hype . no body fooled me and no body made me do it . for some , the jury may be still out for these two opera superstars , but this cd is an example of extraordinary singing and is highly recommended . constantine a. papas el paso , texa
denholm elliott superbly essays the role of john le carre 's spymaster-detective george smiley with verve and intellectual panache . alec guinness ( who immortalized the iconic , laconic scholar-aristocrat intelligence officer in le carre 's masterpiece tinker , tailor , soldier , spy ) finds a worthy peer in otherwise peerless production . murder explores the better and baser qualities of human nature comprising relics and affectations of british class hierarchy.joss ackland is repugnantly fascinating as embittered , narcissistic pederast whose pretensions ( and miltonic sense of `` injured merit '' ) court disaster and encapsulate cultural and political decadence . a murder of quality is pm political fable that touches shakespearean ( dostoyevskian ) depths both tragic and darkly `` comic '' . smiley and former wwii circus/mi6 colleague , alisa brimley ( played with characteristic acumen by glenda jackson ) are heroes of `` the greatest generation '' . in their nation 's `` finest hour '' , they fought and won against forces of barbarism and evil . but today the murder of quality ... in resentment ; pettiness ; and politics of envy and entitlement ... sweeps across the western world . john le carre 's british public school epic dramatically comprises consequences of `` living '' -off heroism and sacrifice of others while wallowing in hollow man/woman self-pity and ( ironic to the max ! ) self-apotheosis .

first of all , i 'm very disappointed by the people who have given this masterpiece their sad , dry , garbage filled reviews . now getting back to how brilliant this album is . if you are into hardcore/heavy , aggressive music combined with strong , roaring but mature , melodic vocals blended with powerful riffs and drumming , you will love this album ! it 's a mixture of soilwork , shadows fall , dry kill logic and all that remains , which is what makes this album so consistent unlike most noise junk these days that sound all repetitive and gets boring in no time . if you like these bands or their type of music , get this album and feed your ears . every song is absolutely fantastic . my personal favourites ( in order ) are : sacrifice , pendulum and rebirth . the sampling provided on this site is n't really helpful so you may purchase/download these tracks to get a complete idea of how great i mean they are and strong chances are if you are really 'into music ' and not just sticking to the mainstream rubbish , this band is definitely worth giving a try and good reviews for their excellent efforts and hardwork .
when i first started reading this book , the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly . soon , though , i realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject ( censorship ) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across . the story is told in letters , predominantly between 19-yo cousins tassie and ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents , neighbors and the nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero 's statue ( nollop , inventor of the sentence `` the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog . '' -- of note because it contains every letter of the english alphabet ) . the idea that a government , especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the english language as this one , would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous ; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects . first , like sheep being led to slaughter and , later , taking charge of their own destinies . i found ella minnow pea a very quick and enjoyable read . it is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about . if you are a fan of language , you will likely enjoy it . it is rare that i come across a book that has a word in it with which i am not familiar ; this book contained many words unfamiliar to me -- a truly impressive level of vocabulary ( though some words were , i think , coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters ) . i recommend this book -- especially for those who , like i , are concerned about the direction our society is taking in terms of censorship
these are truly a wonderful grouping of books that everyone should read if not own . i loved the movies and could n't keep waiting to find out what happens , so bought the books . read them all 1-6 in about <NUM> days ... just could n't put them down . lighthearted reading that is enjoyable
i will be doing a review on the legendary historic landmark 2-cd live compilation set entitled `` jimi hendrix - band of gypsys - live at the fillmore east '' by the late great guitar legend jimi hendrix . as always , i will be editing this review from time to time so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible . in case you have n't read my previous review on the `` band of gypsys '' dvd documentary , this is actually a continuation review of the `` band of gypsys '' saga , this time focusing and highlighting on some of jimi 's unreleased song performances that were performed `` live at the fillmore east '' on <NUM> december <NUM> and <NUM> january <NUM> . this latest 2-cd set , like the dvd documentary , were both separately released in <NUM> and includes additional unreleased song performances that were not included in the original partial six song live compilation released in <NUM> entitled `` hendrix - band of gypsys . '' in case you do n't remember , there was another live compilation ( a sequel ) of additional unreleased performances that was released by capitol records on vinyl and cassette in <NUM> , but not on cd , entitled `` jimi hendrix - band of gypsys <NUM> . '' with this new latest <NUM> 2-cd live compilation collection , along with the original <NUM> and the then latest <NUM> collection , these new unreleased performances shed a new light in the `` band of gypsys '' saga and legacy resulting in bringing these partial fillmore east concerts to life . with this being fact , these newly released performances add much more to the `` band of gypsys '' legend and is clearly becoming more evident of being a truer testament in showing the further advancement of the band 's fully creative side while performing live , in how mixing and combining rock n ' roll , soul , r & b , blues and funk can result in a new powerfully explosive sound of music . before i go any further , i would like to go way back to the beginning . in my dvd documentary review , i have stressed many contributing factors on the ideas and beginnings resulting in the birth and formation of the `` band of gypsys , '' along with the many contributing factors and incidents that would fatally prove disastrous and eventually break up the `` band of gypsys . '' in this latest 2-cd release , i will go further and stress another important contributing factor that was not discussed in my previous dvd documentary review . this is another one of many contributing factors that would result in the birth of the `` band of gypsys . '' according to numerous hendrix biographies and the attached liner booklet that accompanied this 2-cd live compilation set , the genesis , the root of the beginning that started all of this actually evolved from a serious problem jimi neglected which began back in <NUM> . in <NUM> , jimi was then , a typical hungry musician , who would sign any contract or any piece of paper in hopes that it would further advance his career . having signed numerous contracts and many pieces of paper to many , unfortunately , for jimi , there was one piece of paper that jimi signed that would haunt him after he became famous . since jimi did not fulfill his obligations with this particular company , as was the case for the many others jimi forgot about , the plaintiff 's and attorneys representing this opposing company would file a lawsuit against jimi demanding satisfaction . with this lawsuit pending , jimi figured that the only way to resolve and settle this lawsuit was to give them something that would satisfy and resolve this issue . with this in mind , jimi would contact and approach his long time friend and army buddy named billy cox and explained what had happened . it was at this point , when it was decided by jimi to settle out of court by giving the company plantiff 's a new studio album recording for them to release . cox 's reply to this statement was , `` lets go for it ! '' also during this time , while hendrix and cox were discussing these matters further into details , and jimi 's drummer mitch mitchell taking a break in england , buddy miles was a frequent visitor as well as a spectator in the studios with jimi and billy . when miles was told about jimi 's misfortunes and his circumstances surrounding his situation , miles decided the same fate and results as billy . miles reply was , `` lets help our friend in need . '' with jimi sharing and explaining his new ideas for a new sound with cox and miles , the two would agree on liking jimi 's new ideas and would help in fulfilling these goals by playing a mixture and a combination of rock n ' roll , soul , r & b , blues and funk . with these new goals and the stage now being set , this newly born trio would eventually become known as , the `` band of gypsys . '' with cox 's and miles ' full cooperation and their loyalty to jimi , jimi now felt a little at ease and believed that a resolution would soon be in the works in his legal matter . in order to create this ultimate new sound for this new album , jimi elected in preparing fresh new original material . jimi really wanted to record these fresh new original songs in the studio for the sole purpose , and hopes , of fulfilling his legal obligations to this company by giving them a new studio album recording for them to release , and resolve and close this legal matter . but with the fillmore east shows coming up , preparations such as practicing and rehearsing the new song material as well as the familiar songs for the upcoming shows , and with little time remaining , would soon become the main priority resulting in the postponement of the studio recordings of the new songs and therefore , laid aside . with jimi and his management being harassed and subjected to increasing pressure from the company plaintiff 's attorneys , in order to satisfy the capitol / ppx settlement , a new decision was made by jimi 's manager mike jeffery to record all four of the forthcoming live fillmore east concert performances . this decision was rendered in hopes of releasing a live compilation album rather than a studio album . with all of this in mind , and showtime about to commence , all four concert performances spanning two evenings , were recorded onto tape on <NUM> december <NUM> and <NUM> january <NUM> . sadly , these 2-cd live compilation performances contain only sixteen of the many numerous songs that were performed in those four shows . however , it is also evident that these sixteen live song tracks do clearly audibly indicate and show the brilliance and expertise of some of the new genuine original and well-performed song material besides the regularly well known popular hendrix songs . these sixteen live song tracks sounded excellent ! the sixteen live song tracks contained and listed in this 2-cd live compilation set are reviewed as follows : disc <NUM> ( <NUM> . ) `` stone free , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` power of soul , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` hear my train a comin ' , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent well performed slow blues song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` izabella , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` machine gun , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( one of the very first live recordings of this legendary song . it is a powerful and explosive song well performed ! excellent ! outstanding ! as i 've stressed in my other past reviews concerning this legendary song , i 've described this song in this manner ; `` jimi actually presents and brings the vietnam war to the fillmore east audience crowd resulting in firing rounds of machine gun bullets through his powerfully explosive and violent guitar and ending with an excellent breathtaking guitar solo from jimi . '' ) ( <NUM> . ) `` voodoo child '' ( slight return ) ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( an excellent version of one of my favorites ) and ( <NUM> . ) `` we got ta live together . '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( excellent song ! well performed ! ) disc <NUM> ( <NUM> . ) `` auld lang syne , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , second show ) ( well performed the jimi hendrix and `` band of gypsys '' way ) ( <NUM> . ) `` who knows , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent ! outstanding ! great song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` changes , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` machine gun , '' ( <NUM> december <NUM> , second show ) ( another excellent well performed version . refer to disc <NUM> for my review of the other version of `` machine gun . '' my opinions of these two songs are the same . this version is also excellent ! outstanding ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` stepping stone , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` stop , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , first show ) ( another excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` earth blues , '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( another excellent song ! ) ( <NUM> . ) `` burning desire '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) and ( <NUM> . ) `` wild thing . '' ( <NUM> january <NUM> , second show ) ( the troggs classic song performed the hendrix and `` band of gypsys '' way . an excellent well performed version ! ) as story has it , and according to the attached cd liner notes and numerous hendrix biographies , technical problems ruined the two new years eve concerts . a malfunctioning microphone at the outset of the first show rendered energetic versions of `` power of soul '' and `` lover man '' unusable . similar problems hampered the start of the second concert set , compromising the fidelity of the `` auld lang syne / who knows '' medley . nonetheless , these minor trifles made little impact on jimi and the `` band of gypsys . '' in closing , my dvd documentary review stressed on the many main incidents and problems that resulted in disasters and the many contributing factors which would lead jimi into a deep depression and therefore , begin his demise and decline of his health . sadly , the `` band of gypsys '' era would prove to be , short lived , courtesy of the evil crooked plotted schemes of jimi 's manager , mike jeffery . it may have also been at this point ; ( despite all of the incidents and disasters that unfolded in the past , the most recent and the many numerous ones still to come ) that bitter tensions and bad differences would develop , intensify and continually worsen the relationship between hendrix and jeffery . despite all of the tensions and disasters , jimi hendrix is still undoubtedly , the greatest guitarist that ever lived . also , despite being held back and limiting his masterful creativity by jeffery , jimi still performed and played his guitar at a peak unmatched by many of the great guitar legends . jimi hendrix is quite simply , extremely rare , unique and irreplaceable . jimi hendrix 's mark in rock n ' roll history is forever secured . there will never be another jimi hendrix . thanks for your time in reading my long lengthy review and i hope you enjoyed reading it as much as i enjoyed writing it for all of you . i also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits . jimi lives ! long live rock n ' roll ! rock out always . take care , j.l .
i absolutely love this album -- favorite of the year . i see the user reviews are all over the board . i guess i am not surprised . i was taken aback by her prior album , life is sweet . maybe i was expecting something more like her earlier work then , but i got into it over time and i still love it . so i think i was more open minded and trusting when high dive came out after so many years , having no idea what to expect . i ca n't say i love every track on the second half of the disk , but there 's just so much that is great and it is so unbelievably ambitious . just a huge record . thank you , maria
the very funny and very true story of a newly-married couple in new york in the late <NUM> 's . barefoot , which made robert redford famous , features the lovely jane fonda , as well as french actor charles boyer . extremely funny , very well played , eccentric , original , charming , this is great entertainment
# <NUM> on the american film institute 's top <NUM> list , `` the philadelphia story '' is a <NUM> comedy that has never lost its popularity . it 's the film that rekindled katherine hepburn 's then-ailing film career , the only movie james stewart ever won an oscar for , and a movie that cary grant demanded a huge salary for . surprisingly , the movie is actually funny to this very day . grant plays c.k . dexter haven , a millionaire who has recently separated from his wife tracy lord ( hepburn ) . now , tracy is getting remarried and dexter has hired two people from the gossip magazine spy to cover the marriage . they are macaulay connor ( stewart ) and elizabeth imbrie . neither one is happy to be there . connor is on the verge of quitting his job at the spy , as he fancies himself a writer and is sick of writing gossip articles . elizabeth fancies herself a painter and is sick of taking photographs of rich people . pretty soon , connor finds himself falling for tracy as dexter finds himself falling for her again . stewart deserved his oscar as he steals every scene he 's in . as i said , the film is still very funny to this day ( a rarity , since comedy has changed so much over the years ) . anyway , `` the philadelphia story '' is not my favorite film of all time . it think there 's plenty of films on the list placed beneath it that are much better , but `` the philadelphia story '' is a charming film that is definitely worth your time . grade : a
paul newman is great as a despairing , alcoholic `` david '' , once second in his law class , once part of a prestigious law firm , once married ... till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury . the above is past history ... just mentioned in the film . it is some years after , and alcoholic newman , with only <NUM> cases in the last few years , ... has an epiphany ... where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture , so to speak , of a woman treated unjustly , whom he can help . he forgets himself and his troubles , and the people who have pushed him around , ... and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman ... against the hospital and doctors who damaged her . he will later awaken the conscience ( as the movie hints ) of one of the `` goliaths '' he goes up against . however , there are pitfalls ... as opposing lawyer concannon is not above using any trick -- -or person ... to destroy the case . paul newman 's epiphany scene ( which i wo n't describe further to spoil it for you , but which is clearly recognizable ) is quite moving . his goliaths include : the biased , hostile judge , the `` prince of darkness '' superlawyer concannon ( played well by james mason , always good at suave villians ) , the doctors and * * most * * of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate deborah ann kaye , ... and the somewhat hesitant bishop brophy , head of st. catherine 's , the hospital where mrs. kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage . set in boston , a largely catholic city ( i am told ) we here have nominal catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the christian `` good samaritan '' story seriously . my family caution : there are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene . the verdict implies the barely seen <NUM> who also are key players ... the jury , who must deliver the verdict . will they go with the letter of the law ? or -- -its spirit ? ( if you are familiar with this phrase from the christian faith , you have the answer ... ) ( hint of spoiler below ) my wish is that brain injured terri schiavo had had a jury who could see the spirit of the law ! instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a congress that dared ( how dare they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude ) to merely ask for a second look at the whole case . meanwhile , terri slowly starved to death ... shame on us ! shades of nazi eugenics ! ! !
recently , my <NUM> year old , pregnant sister had an emergency c-section and then had complications that resulted in her suffering two strokes . doctors would not tell us anything , no one could even tell us what they thought would happen with her . luckily i found this book . this is a primer for strokes -- it gives everything from a lesson on how the brain works to how a rehabilitation program is put together , to how to cope emotionally as a caregiver . it is a quick read , chock full of substantial information , clear and well-written . you do n't have to read straight through : it is well indexed and has a clear table of contents so you can get to the information you need most quickly . the most valuable part of the book is the glossary of terms that helps you navigate the medical-speak you are going to hear . start with this book and you 'll be equipped with solid information and understanding . this book was a godsend in a time of crisis
how to decribe this gem of a cd . there is such a gentle warm feeling to the songs . it appears that steve kilbey 's voice is aging like a fine wine . great selection of songs with a sprinkling of five new ones . i have always tried to get friends and coworkers to like the church and this one is getting the warmest response . any fan of the church will enjoy and it is a great place to start for the curious
i thought that lahaye and blackstock would never be able to duplicate and certainly not be able to top the writing in the 1st book of this series . how wrong i was ! ! this book is even better than the first ! i can now relate even more to the characters of cedar circle , and i feel like they are my best friends . i can hardly wait to turn each page so i can find out what happens next . i am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the 3rd book , because i know i wo n't be disappointed
this cd re-release of their <NUM> album has been substantially enhanced by the addition of many previously unreleased tracks . it opens with their masterpiece wheel me out , an eerie and evocative piece with addictive beats and strange interpolations by vocalist liz weiss . the hit title track is a funky rap , where did you heart go ? a mellow soulful ballad with great sax and tell me that i 'm dreaming a complex piece with many samples and unusual vocal arrangements . oh mr friction has a jerky rhythm , meandering saxophones and rap-style vocals , whilst carry me back to old morocco has an innovative instrumental mix and fun lyrics , reminiscent of their james brown song . it 's an attack with its delicious sax patterns is closer to a rock song but with a jazzy edge , whilst the sky 's ablaze is a spoken poem with minimal instrumentation . the additional tracks provide a wider perspective on the virtuosity of this unique band whose music remains hard to categorize . my favorites are christmas time in motor city and the dub version of the title track . the list of vocalists and instrumentalists on this innovative album is quite phenomenal . was ( not was ) certainly contributed to making the early 1980s a very interesting period in popular music .
what a challenge ! to take two characters like aliens and predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge . it is unimaginable . each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been . then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film , those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us , the audience . the situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension . the film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ï¿½ the old curiosity shop ï¿½ . so we revisit pyramid civilizations ( three : aztec , egyptian and cambodian ) and the great myth of all times : the antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from . then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens . the general idea is that the space-visitors are the predators , that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid . of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born , for the hunt . easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus . that 's what we are told happened on october <NUM> , <NUM> and is going to happen again on october <NUM> , <NUM> . unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt . in a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life . of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators . the result is absolutely perfect . the human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators , hence saving the world and the human race . the details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular . it reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation . all those vain people who believe in money , guns , science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain , so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend . this is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences . but at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it . though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round . the film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book , i guess . the dvd has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris <NUM> pantheon sorbonn
in the fall of <NUM> i gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening . by chance , a commercial announced that `` the missiles of october '' , one of television 's first attempts at a docu-drama ( the other being the andersonville trial ) was about to come on . we decided to wait ' a few minutes ' to see some of it . three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on . silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of `` you are there '' that kept us riveted to the story . looking back now i realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average american , namely , what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of october of <NUM> , when the world was on the edge of nuclear armageddon . this work is very intellectual , superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes . it is important to remember that this was shown during an era of strong anti-military feeling . the country was winding down from vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what america can accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict . there is a lot of good acting . the scenes are cleverly done , shifting between washington and moscow with tid-bits of b & w 'events in the world ' film thrown in . we get to see `` inside '' the exec committees of both the white house and kremlin and how they plot strategy . attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably . `` pueblo '' in <NUM> did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what i now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen . well recommended .
for new jazz fans or long time art pepper fans this is a must-have album . with the backing of davis ' rhythm section pepper finds his tightest recording . it would have been ideal if they could have mixed in some original material , but this collection of covers really shows pepper 's strength
the further adventures of lord quas is the trout mask replica of rap . madlib , much like captain beefheart , has a unique style that is hard to penetrate and hard to pin down . the songs on this album are n't really songs per se , they are more like random clips and odd ball samples with the occasional spattering of rhyme thrown in . the album is dizzying to listen to . their must be <NUM> or <NUM> little mini skits , song fragments , and other oddities sprinkled through the album . all this combines to make one of the best and innovative rap albums to come down the pipe this year . madlib/quasimoto has created an innovative and unique production style that he created with the first quasimoto album the unseen , continued with the excellent madvillian record , and continues to refine with this production . overall i think that his production sounds more complete on this record than on madvillian . what makes this a weaker release than madvillian is the quality of lyrics and the mc involved . quasimoto is not as good as mf doom . quasimoto seems to be riffing on doom 's style throughout , and his voice can get kind of irritating . he sounds like eminem on helium and without all the homophobic gay bashing . it 's an interesting trick , kind of like what prince did on if i was your girlfriend , but extended for a whole album . his style can be grating though . overall , the further adventures of lord quas is a good album that fans of off-kilter alternative rap will love . if you like dr. octagon , mf doom , peanut butter wolf , or aesop rock , then you 'll enjoy this . you want to be patient with it though , madlib 's style is like peeling an onion , you need to remove some of the outer layers before you can get the full effect of it .
records 'iron maiden ' through '7th son ' were incredible to me ! then came npftd , same cool art , content tho started to drop-off . many of these tracks are simply sub-par & boring . 1- tailgunner- nice , upbeat , moving , enjoyable . 2- holy smoke- not exactly the excellent style of im but still not too bad . 3- no prayer for the dying- eh , slow but speeds up with classic maiden electric duets 4- public enema number one- nothing groundbreaking here but fast & true to old content 5- fates warning -boring ! long slow intro & should have not made it to release . poor ! 6- the assassin - slightly better than average . 7- running silent , running deep- filler although .. the solo 's are really nice 8- hooks in you- nice , could have fit well on their debut with d'anno 9- bring your daughter ... to the slaughter - not my type of material . never liked it . <NUM> . mother russia- dont really like it till the end where is really changes into a fast guitar fest . overall not that bad .. the follow-up fear of the dark was a clear step down & then after that they hit rock bottom & have not come back . x-factor to matter of life & death are just a near complete collapse of decent writing .
i think south parkis like the best show in the world so is family guy but u cant beat s park with anything . <NUM> sad thing is that kenny does not die in seasons after <NUM> and in <NUM> my favorite character kenny what sadly only in the last episode of the season i own seasons 1-8 i know <NUM> didnt come out yet but at a place called cd island they have dvds before they come out . i think that the best episode of this show ever was on season <NUM> and the episode was about the kids playing baseball but they really hated it and they kept winning episode was hilarious . i think anybody who likes south park must get season <NUM> you must .also the episode when the boys play with weapons is also a favorite so if you like south park comedy buy season <NUM> p.s . if youreally like south park buy seasons 1-7 witch r also hilarous
great movie .. a real love story . just watch it .. thats all i have to say
this is john mclaughlin and mils davis at their finest . before miles went fully into fusion , this `` jazz-rock '' is quite exquisite . superb
for the terry pratchett fans out there , nothing more need be said . it 's pratchett , you want to read it , the only reason you 've been hesitating is because it 's marked as a kids book ( juvenile , young adult ... ) but this one is n't just for kids . as with any pratchett book , there are layers and layers , and some of them would n't be obvious to kids at all . for example , kids who have only seen the batman movies , and not the original tv show , will miss it entirely when mrs. tachyon is saying `` dinner , dinner , dinner , dinner ... '' and continues a few more times between interruptions , finally ending with `` dinner , dinner , batman ! '' which is where adults ( at least my generation ) will realize she 's not saying dinner , she 's humming the theme song . also , kids the age of our protagonists , <NUM> or so , may not recognize the `` red shift '' when they get to it ; that 's usually covered a bit later in the science curriculum , such as college physics . the protagonists are johnny , and his friends wobbler ( who wobbles ) , bigmac ( who is large ) , and yo-less , who is apparently the only black in blackbury who does n't say yo . they are joined in this book by kirsty/kasandra ( she changes her name each week ) , who is hyper-intelligent and socially even more inept than the others . each of this team has his own strange store of skills or knowledge . these talents turn out to have entirely different implications when travelling in time than they do in their own time . bigmac 's car-stealing abilities ( which some parents may object to in a kids ' book ) turn out to be impaired when trying to steal a car that does n't have power steering and power brakes . on the other hand , yo-less 's lack of cool is suddenly changed when he puts on period clothing and suddenly looks , as johnny says , as though he plays the saxophone in a band . yo-less does , though get exposed to the more primitive social prejudices of <NUM> , as does kasandra . and bigmac finds out that the skinhead symbols and attitudes that he wears only as a social item suddenly have real meaning , and it 's not pleasant . ok , there 's a bit of a moral or two snuck in here , about thinking about what things mean . there is also at least one moral that readers one and all will ignore , just as the characters do , about following advice ( and about giving it ) . johnny has been working on his world war ii project for school since the previous book , `` johnny and the dead . '' one of the funny bits in the book is how , whenever a kid claims he 's doing `` a project , '' he winds up with all sorts of information that is unsuitable for kids , and/or hitherto classified or secret ; the remembered horror of school projects makes all the adults give in so that they do n't have to think about it any more ! other reviewers have described much of the plot , so i wo n't repeat it here . one thing that some readers may wish to note about this plot is that it is n't just time travel , it 's alternate history as well , and for kids this may serve as an introduction to the whole sub-genre of alternate history . meanwhile , some of the high points : * mrs. tachyon 's cat , guilty - and his tastes in food . * the ice that forms on the characters during their last-minute rush for the air-raid siren . * the importance of pickles . the series has no noticeable sexual content , and no real bad language ; the most dangerous things in it for young readers are the ideas , which may make them * gasp * think ! it may also make them lifelong pratchett addicts . in the opinion of an existing pratchett addict , there 's nothing at all wrong with that
this cd had huge breakdowns long before those were popular . sure , they are n't as popular as all the `` hardcore/metalcore '' bands around now , but the similarities to that genre are striking when after listening to that music for a while you go back and listen to this one .
it 's been said before ( and over and over in all the reviews here , so i wo n't bore you with the details why it 's been said ) but i 'll say it again : `` roadhouse '' is a great bad movie ! i do find it funny that this one has earned that type of fond recollection by so many and turned into a cult hit of sorts because of it ; while there are literally tons of these type of movies that littered the action/adventure landscape throughout the 80s and early 90s . hardly any of them are even remembered much less revered to the extent `` roadhouse '' is . i guess it 's just one of those things . maybe its because the movie has ( at the time ) bigger stars , a bigger budget and a larger abundance of gratuitous t & a than most theatrically released action flicks that bare a general resemblance to it ( of course , you could find plenty of this type of thing lining the walls of your local blockbuster , but even though they supply the action and nudity , they do n't often supply the big stars and big budgets ) . maybe it was just a matter of right place , right time , right amount of exposure , etc . who knows ; but whatever the reason , i 'm glad enough this film has endured . this special edition does its legacy as a winking-joke-unto-itself proud ( swayze 's character is known as `` the best bouncer in the business . '' where was the annual bouncer convention of '89 held and how is the winner of that title determined ? ) . the best reason to pick this up instead of the previous , bare-bones dvd transfer is the commentary tracks . the first is by the film 's director , rowdy herrington , which is actually rather informative considering the source material being examined . but the real treat is the other commentary track by director and professional fanboy kevin smith and his production partner scott mossier . not only is it a great commentary , but the very idea that the producers of this dvd saw it appropriate to include a commentary from someone who has nothing to do with making this movie shows that all involved are in on the joke . they should have just gone the full nine and held contest to find the ultimate , die hard `` roadhouse '' fan and let him/her do the commentary . and i 'd be willing to bet , somewhere , quentin tarrentino is pissed he did n't get a call ( he loves contributing his two cents to cult films that he has nothing to do with other than being either a huge fan or hating the movie 's guts - either way , always an entertaining commentator ) . now if only studio execs would get off their butts and release perhaps the only junk-action movie more loved and clamored for than this one : `` stone cold . '' ( it feels like that is the only movie ever made that has not made it to dvd , yet everyone seems to want it to be released , so what gives ? ! since when are n't studios egger to cash in ? ? ? ) give us a `` stone cold '' special edition and slap it in a two-pack with this classic and you 'll have all the craptacular entertainment this side of the old school steven seagal flicks you 'll ever need .
as a high school teacher i was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that jon stewart had decided to make a teacher 's edition of anything . when i found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a history class i thought that i should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire . it is definitely worth its weight in something . i find that the daily show 's viewpoint is refreshing and that jon stewart 's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider democracy . the citizen 's guide to democracy inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter . i think that most of the book is interesting but i would n't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside . as a book for the masses sure . as a book intended for teachers no . i suppose that is the joke of it all . no teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on <NUM> minutes or the daily show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing supreme court justices with naked pictures
all i really wanted was some place where i could keep track of the books i read and my thoughts on them . this book is wondefully laid out but it is oriented more for people who belong to reding groups or book clubs etc . if you just want a little book diary for yourself then do not buy this book . do yourself a favor and buy a regular notebook but if you do belong to a group or like to discuss your books then this is an excellent buy
a recent rolling stone issue listed the <NUM> greatest guitarists and omitted this fine ( probably <NUM> of <NUM> or so , blues greats ) performer . though it is hard to be totally objective as i have both seen and met this great guy on a few occasions , there really is no one who plays as well or has this tone . he is a fantastic blues and jazz virtuoso , and is certainly headed for greater recognition . i prefer his own writing and that is what kept me from giving this <NUM> stars as there are a couple of covers included here that are not of the same caliber . thank you , robben for another very good recording/perfomance
excellent overview of their whole careers . good selection of songs and locations . fun for fans . also a good summary for those who have never heard them or seen them before . recommend it for all ages
i have programmed in applescript for many years , but this book really helped to clarify a number of issues . this is no starry-eyed , applescript-can-do-anything fluff job , but a down-to-earth comprehensive description of a powerful , sometimes quirky , tool that will make your mac even more useful , if you are willing to invest some time to learn . i highly recommend this book for anyone thinking of using applescript , or anyone already using it
great <NUM> 's sounding pop , but with a lot of <NUM> uniqueness . i love it
if you like gorecki and part , you will want to buy this cd . as a classical music fan with widespread interests , i have placed this on my favorites shelf . it is deeply spiritual , tuneful , and interesting .
this item , volume <NUM> of the first season had two defective episodes that would not play all the way through . the rest of them were cool .. black and white , but action filled and fun
my son , now <NUM> , used to love this book when he was <NUM> and <NUM> years old . it was also a lot of fun to read for me
this book by susan mackey-kallis provides an interesting approach to classic movies like star wars , the natural , lion king , <NUM> , etc . using a mythological perspective . the ideas of joseph campbell and carl jung are illustrated using examples from these films . i found the book to be very informative . a good read if you are at all interested in film or mythology . another good book to check out by the same author is `` oliver stone 's america , '' which takes a similar approach to stone 's films .
this is a very fast paced workout . it took a couple of times through to learn the routine . denise does n't cue all that well . she 's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement . most people do n't like that about her , but i think she is motivating . you definitely work all muscle groups and you 'll be sweating with this workout . i 'm tired , but invigorated by the end . i enjoyed this workout a lot
this `` robobox '' is not the mgm version reviewed below . it does n't have any of the extras , it 's just the movies . still great movies , though
this is a clasic movie for many of us who were at that age in that time period . if you are not turned off by the <NUM> 's too much you will love this funny movie . it is trendy for then , but it is really funny and good . just realize at the time these movies were some of our favorites . it is still near and dear to my heart . i think it is a classic . if you like it go on to ferris bulers day off and somekind of wonderful for other movies in this style and time period
as a jazz guitar player , i personally love stan getz , and to hear him with ray brown , one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever . this was also the first i have listened to herb ellis play , his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until charlie christian . all in four really great musicians playing together , if you like this , check out russell malone , ray brown and monty alexander 's cd .
i 'll have to admit i steered a bit clear of joshua bell in the early years of his career . my aversion was n't based on his musical abilities . he was one of the performers that a few music industry publicity people decided would appeal to a younger audience so he was dressed as a teenaged heart throb that seemed to belong on the cover of a magazine geared toward junior high school girls than a lover of good , serious music . i think i resented shameless attempts to lure a `` younger crowd '' into concert halls to hear a symphony . i was young at the time and it did n't matter to me whether the guy on the cover was wearing a tux and might be a bit overweight or if he looked like the kid next door or the woman was slightly flawed wearing a gown or if she looked like a sex symbol . all i cared about was the music and i responded by not purchasing any of the various wunderkind releases and joshua bell was in this category . of course i could boycott the recordings but i could n't ignore the likes of joshua bell . he was always on television , performing with symphony orchestras ( classical music radio stations still broadcast a plethora of concerts at the time ) and i think only the most closed minded listeners could deny his talent . since that time i 've seen him perform and what i 've found is an amiable performer with great talent who knows people that while people are paying to hear him play , the performance has to be about the music and not the performer and even if he has n't aged , at least according to the cover photos on his recordings , he has matured as a performer . his technique is still evolving which could one day earn him a place with some of the great violinists ( remember he 's only in his thirties , he still has quite a career ahead of him ) , and he 's able to perform some of the works of the greet classical composers and pieces with popular appeal without getting gimmicky . voice of the violin is a collection of vocal pieces arranged fop the violin . each of the arrangements works well for violin . the challenge is performing them with the same passion we are used to when we hear them performed by vocalists . just about every tenor and soprano of note has performed and recorded schubert 's `` ave maria . '' massenet 's `` porquoi me reveller '' from werther is a showstopper that was a favorite of tenors from caruso to pavarotti . fans of fredericka von stade and renee fleming have grown to love `` song to the moon '' from rusalka . we 've grown accustomed to the greats singing many of the works on this collection with beauty and gusto . chances are expectations are high for anyone familiar with these works . bell delivers . he evokes the emotions of each piece and in a way his violin does sing as he performs . this can be tricky . so often vocal works , especially those from the operatic stage , do n't adapt all that well to instrumental transcriptions and it is the rare instrumental performer that can do justice to the works , but joshua bell seems to in this recording . fans of joshua bell do not need to be convinced of the merits of this recording . some may feel this is not a serious enough recording but i think most people who enjoy good music will appreciate bell 's artistry and the beautiful melodies are sure to give listeners hours of pleasure .
i love this movie . for those who love romance , fantasy , knighthood , gallantry , and all that , this is your thing . one reason i love it is that don quixote must have read ( ! ) the saying , `` when you tell a man he is brave , you are helping him to become so . '' the don , this mad-man , sees nothing but the beautiful and pure in the whore aldonza , and despite her violent rejection of his view of her and the name `` dulcinea '' that he gives her , she eventually realizes his purity of mind and begins to think maybe there is something worthwhile in her after all . thus , she becomes , slowly , as he envisions her . that to me is thrilling . and , i heartily disagree with those reviewers who object to the voices of peter o'toole ( dubbed ) and sophia loren . sure , they are n't the best , but taking the don 's for instance ; if his voice had been any better , it would have been 'way out of character for the `` knight of the woeful countenance . '' and a shirley jones voice would not have been convincing for the whore aldonza , to my way of thinking . to me , they were both perfect for their parts . cummon , let 's be realistic ! if you want perfect voices , watch `` carousel '' etc . this movie is inspirational , touching , exciting , and one i watch many times , getting a thrill out of it each time . am ordering the dvd with captions , as i do n't want to miss one word !
first of all , i 'm not jeannine ; i 'm her husband-she bought the book for me . i have been wanting to build a guitar ( and bass ) for a very long time , and have been gathering information from a variety of sources . but this book covers it all as far as construction goes , and its not too bad on the finishing side of things . it covers <NUM> different types of neck construction , and flat top and carved top bodys . definately money well spent
i read this book in the audio form against my will for a political book club . i thought to myself , `` oh great ! another liberal tome , telling us liberals how we went wrong and how we need to learn to strategize . blau blau blau ... '' instead , i was transported into an america of my dreams , lovingly cradled by mr. reich 's comforting and hopeful vision of america . possessed with a masterful narrating voice , mr. reich connects the reader to our rich , democratic traditions and applies these tried and true values to our current problems . he makes it sound so easy .... i found myself wishing that he was our president . when i told this to a friend of mine , she noted that `` he 's probably too short . '' i did n't give it <NUM> stars because i did n't agree with some of his views on globalism and i thought he was a little too pollyannaish for these times . if our elected officials would just sit down , read this , and follow the instructions , america would look more like the america that we all claim that it is . hopefully , some future president will have this wise and wonderful man on his or her side in the whitehouse again .
as a business person , i found helpful and interesting facts on how to market financial products . the topics are discussed in an organized manner and the book is relatively easy to follow . there are separate chapters for each aspect of the marketing program . customer retention issues and regulations are also discussed in quite a bit of detail .
a great show makes a great cd . i will never understand why this show did n't become a hit ! i saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since . maltby and shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful b'way show . this score is great- fatherhood blues , i want it all , the story goes on , the ladies singing their song- these are unforgetable and deserved to be heard . get this gem
i admit , i rediscovered spandau ballet after hearing the song `` gold '' over and over while playing grand theft auto-vice city in <NUM> . so i bought this cd recently . it 's a very complete spandau collection for the casual fans . die hard fans may find a missing song they think should be included but the major hits -- '' gold , '' `` true , '' `` communication , '' `` chant no . <NUM> , '' are all here . i 'm not too much feeling the black and white cover , but the booklet and interior design make the set a very impressive `` best of '' collection
most of these reviews address the book not how the production did with its presentation of the book . my opinion , it was wonderful . i know its a generalization but i wish more audio books were like this , like old <NUM> 's radio shows . it makes the book become alive . the casting was well-done . the voices are what i imagined them to be , maybe better . if only one person was narrorating this book ( like most are done now ) then this book probably would n't be as much fun to listen to on cd . so , if you have a choice to either listen to one voice or many voices with some amusing sound effects , pick the latter
at first blush , the everard family does n't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors . hugh , drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency , is in love with his brother john 's wife . john , a general in the army in france , does not make an appearance , but his sons nick and david do . nick is feckless and irresponsible , just one step ahead of being drummed out of the royal navy himself , while david is more professional if somewhat dull . that in the course of the book , one 's opinion of everyone changes <NUM> degrees is a tribute to the author 's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character 's past layer by layer , like peeling an onion . the criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing . yes , the book is choppy and yes , it is hard to follow the course of the action . one 's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix , but then you realize that this is the whole point . fullerton 's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the battle of jutland felt to those who were there . jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events . fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time . but you ca n't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative , just as even lord jellicoe was n't able to do so . for that , you need to consult another book ( i would recommend rules of the game by andrew gordon , which is not only the finest description of the battle , but one of the finest works of military history ) , but do it after you read this book , so that you get the full flavor of the writer 's intent . very few writers capture the fog of war as well as fullerton does
excellent , great camera work , very good sound and commentar
ideal for anyone who likes listening to the music of micheal bolton or who wishes to lay a trap for a michael bolton fan
to even begin to describe the music on this cd is difficult ... it 's like trying to describe what god looks like . not only is the music just incredible , but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet . luker 's salve regina had me in tears at the end ( and i am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it now ) . scott 's singing is just remarkable . if angels sing they sound like these two women . for heaven 's sake just buy the cd ! !
am i justified in believing that muscular , meritorious pop music -- the kind we shove our hands toward the volume knob for , the kind that thrills us just to be alive for -- is on the cusp of a major comeback , or do the continuous coronations of [ ... ] we 've witnessed so far this year mean that we 're all sitting shivah for the good stuff and are too stoned on stupidity to recognize it ? the very same signs that appear encouraging from one angle are horrifying from another . look no farther than the terrific anna nalick , one of a sad handful of artists hobbled this spring by befuddling single choices ( let 's just say for now that whoever botched the radio plan for that sterling new dixie chicks record deserves a daily caning in the town square until no fewer than one of those babbling loudmouth heifers * is * ready to make nice ) . her gorgeous debut album , wreck of the day , got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single `` breathe ( <NUM> a.m. ) , '' so of course those dolts at columbia records went with `` in the rough '' as a follow-up ( why not that magnificent title track ? or `` forever love '' ? or even `` citadel , '' for cryin ' out freakin ' loud ? ! ) , and of course it tanked . but then , just like manna straight from the fingertips of god himself , the geniuses ( geniui ? ) behind tv 's gangbusters smash `` grey 's anatomy '' used `` breathe '' to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season 's most-watched episode , and nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness . top forty was interested again , and columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing nalick 's album with extra tracks , one of them being -- get this , guys -- a newly-recorded version of `` wreck of the day '' that is so balls-out horrendous , you just * know * they 're going to make it the third single . the sorry [ ... ] -- every one of them -- need to be slapped . hard
faith no more , classic melodies , eternal tunes , quirky lyrics angel dust for sure ! songs i never get tired of hearing , even after years and years . mike patton is a complicated one-man orchestra not out ther for to make the easily digestible . subtle musical intricacies and weaving insrtuments , i hear something new every time . composition wise , i 'd rank him up there with mozart . a few songs fall a little short , but where they 're on , they 're very on
& quot ; the aspern papers & quot ; is a surprisingly short , sexy and suspenseful novel . it will completely change your opinion of henry james ; he shows himself to be an master of suspense and well played out drama instead of the ambiguous pussyfooting plodder that most people think him to be . there is a definite touch of evil in this novella . it takes place in a stuffy interior world dominated by an old sinister woman in a green shade . the narrator 's intentions are quite amoral and evil . the narration is deftly created through sure touches of insecurity and self pity . the trick of the unreliable narrator is used to great effect . and at no point does it seem anything other than a seamless and effective method of narration
i have to say this is my favorite of all of leslie 's workouts . yes , i agree with the other person who said that mary kay is annoying , however , i feel the best when i am done with this video . i like the variety of it all
this is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical , haunting scores ever composed for a film . each succeeding track is a treat for the ears , refreshing and invigorating . neeley and varese sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem . in my opinion , though , the only part of the entire cd that does n't work is the beginning of the `` waxworks '' track - the score to this particular moment in the film ( when norma , watching herself onscreen , rises triumphantly to proclaim `` i 'll be up there again , so help me ! '' ) is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom . in the original , the music is strong , powerful and almost spine-tingling , but this moment on the cd is underwhelming and not fully realized . however , what is one misfire ( totalling all of eight bars , at most ) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording ? ! in short , if you love film music , you most likely love the score to sunset boulevard - and if you love sunset boulevard , then you will most likely love this recording , too
any moderate fan of the scarlett pimpernel , musical , book or movie ( s ) should own this cd . i absolutely love the songs `` believe '' and `` vivez '' which are not on the encore cd , and this disk is worth owning for them alone . i 'm not crazy about chauvlin 's voice on this disk , which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times . for great chauvlin tracks ( like where 's the girl ) you definatly need to buy the encore cd . christine andreas 's renditions of `` only love '' and `` you are my home '' are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show .
this low budget work of fiction from <NUM> produced during the cold war era and blaming a shift in the earth 's axis on simultaneous atomic testing by russia and america leads to increasing enviornmental disasters of changes in weather patterns , increasingly violent storms of high wind damage , tornadoes , thick fog banks and stifling heat that keeps increasing to well over <NUM> degrees ! is this beginning to sound familiar ? this movie may be unintentionally the most prophetic movie ever made . disregard the sub plot of edward judd having marriage problems and you have a well written documentation of today 's weather changes with the unified suspicion that we are a doomed race . ours has not been by atomic fault , but may be due to increasing sun activity or perhaps , as this movie suggests , we are a little closer now . this science fiction scenario happens in about a month , for us it has taken years . yet , the power of the press , with real reporters unlike the news bunnies and manni-kens that report our news today dig to get the real facts from a government hiding the truth . why ca n't we get them also ? all inconvenient truths aside , will someone please stop this industrial baloney and tell the truth ? ! like the reporters in this picture , i really would like to know how much time is left before we burn up . get extra copies of this film to give to your friends . perhaps some smart fellow in hollywood will look into it and consider producing a more modern movie with the added elements of today 's conditions . all `` rocks from space '' movies aside , this probability has a greater implication for the future of the human race . a film of value , although today 's audience will be impatient by the slow pace and low volume conversations . despite this , it is still a film that can fill you with questions
wire was a blassed anomaly in the punk world , denying all attempts to categorize them as anything but brilliant . & quot ; artpunk & quot ; ? nah ... & quot ; progpunk & quot ; ? nope ... see , nothing works . amazing & amp ; very influential stuff . rem & amp ; the minutemen both have publicly praised the genre-bending work of wire
it never ceases to amaze me how the coen brothers make me love movies from genres that i do n't usually like . take this film for instance , its been out for six years , when it came out i said it looks dumb , i do n't like stories about hillbillies , but thats not what it is at all , its actually a great film with all kinds of twists and turns . in a word it can be described as delightful , with the most fun part of o'brother being that it keeps you guessing throughout , just when you think one thing is going to happen , bam , supprise , something else . i really enjoyed the music too , i ca n't get that damn soggy bottom boys song outta my head , and i doubt you 'll be able to either . my only regret is that i was to ignorant to watch it sooner , i hope you really enjoy this film as much as i did .
this has always been my favorite john lennon album because the production is fantastic and the songwriting is ecclectic and creative ... i also believe that this is probably the most consistent post solo-beatle release because of all fab four post solo recordings , the album 's production is flawless ... in <NUM> , lennon told rolling stone that he had really enjoyed paul 's band on the run because he felt it was conceptual ... thus , i 've entertained the possibility that this album is in part , a response to band on the run because it displays conceptualism and ecclectisism . like band on the run , walls and bridges displays the beatles ' unique ability to go from beautiful lush ballads to rocking rockers ... at times , i feel like i 'm listening to the white album .... the pentatonic 'going down on love ' tracks to the up-tempo , brisk , jazzy 'whatever gets you thru the night ' ... then , there 's the soft harry nilson assisted number 'old dirt road ' ... then john immidiately answers this mellow country song with 'what you got ' ( which feels kind of like 'everybody 's got something to hide except for me and my monkey ' ) and so on ... it has been suggested that john 's ' # <NUM> dream ' was a subconscious tribute to george ... i love this album because i feel that john is in harmony with his other beatle compatriots and that he 's no longer bitter with his past like he was on plastic ono band .. 'surprise surprise ' with elton john even has a quotation from a beatle 's song ... see if you can guess what it is ... ! ! ! this is the first post beatles album that really really sounds like something the beatles would have been truly worthy of producing ( unlike band on the run that although was a milestone for paul only sustained mediocre production ! ! ! ) this is also a fun album and along with all things must pass and tug of war , it stands as the best produced post beatles recording .. if you 're a beatle 's fan but think that there was n't any good solo beatle 's album .... sit down on a quiet sunday evening with a friend or two in front of a fire with some hot cocoa , sit back , and enjoy a great album ! !
this <NUM> novel used sources like `` the politics of heroin in southeast asia '' by alfred w. mccoy , and the others listed in the 'preface ' . it takes place in washington dc . ronald malcolm works for the `` american literary historical society '' , and reads detective and mystery novels to summarize its plots for his employer . one day their new accountant tells malcolm there is a discrepancy in the records ; of seven crates shipped from seattle only five crates arrived in washington . this had not been noticed previously . the accountant reports this loss in a memo . malcolm reports to work on thursday . it is his turn to go out for sandwiches for lunch , and he uses a basement exit for a short-cut . he also runs an errand . he returns to find the front door locked ; he has to use his key . then he finds that all of his co-workers have been killed by professional assassins . malcolm leaves the building and calls the `` panic number '' from a public phone to report the maximum damage ; he is told to disappear and call back later . when malcolm calls back , he is told to make contact in an alley of a georgetown theater . but his rescue team takes a shot at malcolm , who fires back , escapes , and goes to ground . will malcolm be rescued by he cia or found by the killers ? and who is the double agent ? after you read this novel you can better understand the film , which is a simplified and condensed version ( called `` three days ... ) . the story was changed from drug smuggling ( to censor drug references ? ) , and relocated to ny city . this story seems implausible to me , since eliminating the one link in seattle would avoid the furious investigation that would follow a massacre of seven in washington dc .
the master vladimir nabokov approach about a chess player are told brilliantly inside an introspetive mood filled with emotional tension . widely recommendable
it looks like amazon has taken the reviews of the audio casette set with the same name and put them on this product . there are <NUM> stories and not <NUM> as the cassette reviews state . they take up <NUM> cds . there is one technical flaw . the labeling is wrong on four of the cds . the number is correct ( 1-6 ) but the list of stories on <NUM> and <NUM> are swapped and <NUM> and <NUM> are swapped . once you solve that mystery things go well . these are short stories and not novels so you should not expect complex plot development or character descriptions . they are a good way to kill half an hour of otherwise wasted time in your life .

this is the central question in featherstone 's treatment of the dukes v. wal-mart stores , inc. class action lawsuit . focusing on depositions , sworn testimony and direct personal interviews , featherstone gets right to the heart of her subject in the first chapter . the anecdotal evidence , supported by ample statistics , demonstrates that something is , indeed , awfully wrong with wal-mart and the disparate ways in which it treats its workers . as important as the gender discrimination issue is the consideration of how wal-mart has , and will continue to , build its fortune off the backs of the working poor . given enough time , it is entirely possible that certain areas of the country will be economically drained , committed to an addiction of buying at and working for wal-mart . it is the low-price panties version of a super size me world . worst of all , however , is the company 's documented practice of referring its own workers to social service agencies , to apply for benefits they need because wal-mart neither provides sufficient benefits nor pays employees enough to afford them . puts a whole new spin on the phrase `` corporate welfare . '' where is the politicians ' indignation over this abuse of the welfare system ? well researched and well documented with references and notes . one latter chapter does tend to slow down with emphasis on legal citations and stats , but this is necessary to put a factual basis behind the personal stories . whether you are against wal-mart , a wally-world fan or a blissfully unaware consumer , you can not read this book and remain unaffected in some manner . if it does not turn you completely away from shopping there , it should at the very least give you pause before opening your wallet .
released my mgm -- metro goldwyn-mayer , october <NUM> , <NUM> . rainy day : pleasesee this film from beginning to the very end without any distraction or interruption . this is a very important and wee-made film . on dvd `` main options '' , notice the card frank sinatra is holding . showing the back side and changing to queen of diamonds . raymond shaw ( laurence harvey ) has just returned from korea . at the airport is a grand fanfare put on by his head-strong mother ( angela lansbury ) whoose husband , john iselin ( james gregory ) is campaigning to be the next president in the white house . raymond despises his mother , but she has this `` control '' over him . she also is handling her husband 's campaign very closely even giving him cleverly the exact way to answer a question . meanwhile , bennett marco ( frank sinatra ) has a dream that he and his other combat buddies are at a garden tea party meeting hosted by a chairlady ( helen kleeb , [ the waltons tv series ] ) . the dream changes to the men sitting at a seminar hosted by dr . yen lo ( khigh dhiegh ) . dr . lo asks raymond , while all are brainwashed , to kill ed ( richard lepore ) . major marco suddenly wakes up screaming from his dream . major marco decides to investigate if his other soldiers are experiencing the same frightful dream . also in the cast : janet leigh , henry silva , james edwards , douglas henderson , john mcgiver , jocelyn jordan , lloyd corrigan , joe adams , bess flowers , tom lowell . academy award nominations : best supporting actress , angela lansbury , best film editing . dvd is in full screen on one side , wide-screen on the other side . audio commentary by john frankenheimer . special <NUM> interview with frank sinatra , john frankenheimer , george axelrod . frank sinatra pulled this film out of further release because of the assassination of our president of the united states , john fitzgerald kennedy , november <NUM> , <NUM> , as you will understand why after seeing this film all the wat through . kennedy 's accused assassin was lee harvey oswald who was then assassinated by jack ruby on his way to trial . oddly , their are references in this film to president abraham lincoln who was assassinated , april <NUM> , <NUM> . did oswald see the film `` the manchurian candidate '' ? frank sinatra re-released this film in <NUM> . frank sinatra personally chose lucille ball for the role of the mother , however the role ultimatly went to angela lansbury . one source had the honor of seeing a `` special exhibition '' print and he swears this special print showed the big queen of diamonds costume with red over black . this print is not available on vhs nor dvd . this film was also re-released to pay-per-view television in <NUM> . terrible remake : the manchurian candidate ( <NUM> ) with denzel washington , meryl streep and liev schreiber .
i believe that third and fourth graders would really enjoy this text about this mexican american youngster . children would also enjoy the occasional spanish included in the text . the only problem : soto does not include a glossary this time . oh well , soto does a great job of portraying a family that understands what it means to really work for a living and teaches kids not to take everything for granted . soto stays away from the sterotypical `` lazy mexican ''
this was an extremely well-written and well-executed book from a technical standpoint . the writing was smooth and concise , with excellent flow , and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless . wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life , a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood , while also creating a certain honesty that ( eventually ) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like . a side-effect of this detached viewpoint , however , is that at first i felt somewhat removed from what was happening . but i slowly warmed up to the young wolff , and by the end i came to cheer for him . i also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up , feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words . wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest , tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear . overall i would recommend the book highly , and i plan on reading more from this author
forest is a low-key folk group that is in line with incredible string band , but in my opinion , they are even better . this <NUM> cd package is a very wise buy as it 's full of wonderful and amazing music . <NUM> guys are all talented multi-instrumentalists and their compositions sounds like the renaisance folk songs ! very beautiful , fantasy , dreams , love themes incorporated seamlessly in this package . best cuts : graveyard ( cd <NUM> ) , bad penny ( opening track of cd <NUM> ) ... etc . in general cd <NUM> is even better , of course , both cd is fresh and never boring
the photographs are large and clear . the poses are natural . the models represent a range of physical types . the disk has 360° views of each pose . wow ! this is an invaluable reference for artists . really the only game in town . there 's also a website where you can get additional poses . highly recommended
the greatest thing about this lp is the songwriting . sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing , dealing with mortality and being average . i think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on other songs he creates a great diversity and depth . mitchell froom 's production is perfect for the songwriting ( it 's almost as good as kiko )
this is the first branford i heard ( back in <NUM> ) and i 've heard a lot of him since . i sometimes find his stuff hard to get into , but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that i keep coming back to it . also , and this is definitely worth mentioning , his band is hot and jeff & quot ; tain & quot ; watts is an astonishing drummer . in any event , contemporary jazz , the dark keys , bloomington , the beautyful ones , and especially the recent footsteps of our fathers are all quite stunning albums , but they require comfort with free and intense music . if you already dig <NUM> 's coltrane and ornette , go for it . if not , and you want to jump in and hear why people think branford is so good , crazy people music is a great place to start . you get the fiery intensity of the later albums , but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes ( and the solos ) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style . i would n't start any earlier in his career , because you get his more & quot ; bop & quot ; influenced style , which he has evolved past ( though he still has that sweet tone ) . trio jeepy is another place to start , but i think it too , though a fine album , does n't give a complete sense of his mature sound . i gave this four stars , because it 's not his most amazing work , but i do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years . if this gets its hooks in you , you 'll like the later albums ; if this sounds overwhelming and , well , crazy , you 'll probably find the later albums only more so
if you love all things james brown , then you must buy this collection of funky hits ( tinged with more than a hint of jazz ) he did with his <NUM> 's band , the jbs . believe me , you will not be able to resist the beat ! the excellent horn work of maceo parker and fred wesley are worth the price of the cd alone . the majority of the cuts are r & amp ; b dancing and roller skating classics , especially , & quot ; ( it 's not the express ) it 's the jbs monorail & quot ; , & quot ; gim me some more & quot ; , & quot ; pass the peas & quot ; , & quot ; same beat & quot ; , and & quot ; damn right , i 'm somebody & quot ; . & quot ; think & quot ; , with vocals by lyn collins , is just too funky for words . do n't pass this one by
wow ! that 's one word that comes to mind . wow ! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air , their has not been any anime shows that have interested me . for years i searched , never finding anything worth watching . then , i sort of gave up . i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail . then one night it happened : i saw the second episode of samurai champloo air on adult swim . at first , i wasnt paying attention to the words and action . i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels : the animation ! the artwork was incredible ! the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real . it was almost as if it was a sitcom , with real people . only tis was completly animated . it was eye-popping ! then , i started to watch the show itself and the show was great ! ! ! anyway , since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes . but alas , the last one ( number seven ) comes out this month on the 17th . the show is coming to an end . so anyway , im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them . i rated volume one of samurai champloo below : episode one : tempestuous temperaments- jin , mugen and fuu meet for the first time . mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three `` bad asses '' and sends some cowards to go get them . mugen however , does not know that jin has killed them already . mugen mistakes jin as one of the `` bad asses '' and attatcks him . a brilliant fight insues , and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together . i rate episode one a 10/10 episode two : redeye reprisal- mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one . in this episode , the man is out for revenge . the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen . also , jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him . another great fight . and last of all , our modest ( cough ) fuu gets smashed . i rate this episode 9/10 episodes <NUM> & <NUM> : hellhounds for hire part one and two- the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together . jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd . mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang . fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house . i give both episodes <NUM> & <NUM> 10/10 thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo . if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes . i will say this , they are really expensive . but they are worth the money . i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it . if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not , i reccomend you buy it . i can personally vouch for this dvd . of course , its always good to check other reviews by different people as well . later . i hope this review helped

and i 'm still listening to this gem . to be honest , i bought this in spite of `` kiss from a rose '' . i hated that seal was getting so much air play becaus of that song ... not that the song was bad or anything , but i fell in love with his first album , and i thought `` kiss from a rose '' paled in comparison to tracks like : `` future love paradise '' and `` violet '' . all these years later , i can still enjoy listening to this cd . i am writing this review because i just popped it in while at work . there is n't a bad track on this thing
this is the kind of cd that you do n't skip over any tracks on . you ca n't help but to knod your head and tap your fingers to each beat and imagine being in a small intimate venue hearing the songs being played live . most of the songs are kind of fast . great driving cd . favorite tracks : <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> and you got ta love track <NUM> ( also on his previous cd ) .

the story line is superb ... the scenery is stunning and gorgeous , vast mountains and green valleys , walled castles and fortresses . hidetora , the aging warlord , holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside . he announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons . only one son , the youngest , dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting , he predicts the same after the transfer of power . he believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy . the youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord . hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons . he has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half , which they easily do . he gives them in succession , three arrows bundled together , representing the unity of the family , none can break the bundle . this is hidetora 's example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified . he envisions the house of ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during hidetora 's own reign of power . in his anger , hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes ... yet subarua , the youngest , holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass . hidetora visits taro 's castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to taro 's wife , sue ' . they are forced to move out . hidetora discovers after the transfer of power , he is no longer respected . sue ' married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war , a war in which her parents were murdered . she harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother , jiro . hidetora 's court jester creates a mocking song about taro being like a gourd , spinning this way and spinning that way , implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it . at a family gathering taro hears the song and is outraged ... in a surprise move , hidetora and his guards leave to visit jiro . hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either , not at all what he expected . he left abruptly ... the treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them . as predicted by subaru , the younger brother , war is inevitable . local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie , which brother to support . hidetora goes into hiding . eventually he goes mad . his only guard and caregiver , the jester , does not leave his side . this film contains very strong battle scenes . the desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers . loosely based on shakespeare 's king lear , this japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur . the costumes and scenery are fabulous . in the film , there are tender moments between the jester and hidetora . there are moving scenes where jiro 's wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage ... the producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion . at some point , hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled . the ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer . the film is amazing ! erika borsos ( erikab93
the secret history is a record of the mongolian royal families , which is thought to have been written during the thirteenth century . paul kahn has kept the original prose format in his translation , which i feel makes this the only version to own . it begins with the creation myth of the wolf and deer from which the mongolian people ( in legend ) are descended from ; throught he birth of temujin , and ending with the ascention to the throne of ogedai khan . i highly recommend this to those who are looking for primary sources to add to their asian history collections

hamlet 's mill : an essay investigating the origins of human knowledge and it 's transmission through myth giorgio de santillana & hertha von dechend hamlet 's mill is an amazing piece of macrocosmic literature that should be recognized as a true classic . while some scholars and researchers may attempt to discredit this work as attempting to pull together unrelated mythology from distant times and cultures , this could n't be farther from the truth . nearly all religions are based upon two primary foundations , the first being astrotheology , the second being the use of entheogens ; as above , so below . while the stars in the sky may show differently at different locations , and the plants in a specific vicinity may be different , this does not negate the overall concept of the foundations being the same . santillana & dechend have done a fantastic job at providing evidence that the knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes is far older than can be escaped , downplayed , or ignored . the cultural myths , though slightly varying by time and distance have the same foundations , the same origins because they 're based on the same concept ... the stars and heavens ... know the heavens or die ... essential knowledge for planting , harvesting and storing food as well as for preparing for seasonal changes . this is a most important book of many for understanding the ancient mysteries . other books that will help the reader understand these concepts include john allegro , acharya s. , robert hewitt brown , gordon wasson , john major jenkins , peter lamborn wilson , jonathon ott , terence mckenna , g. schiaparelli , albert hofmann , richard schultes , christian ratsch , joseph campbell , manly p. hall , kersey graves , jordan maxwell , ernest busenbark , gerald massey , etc. , to name a few . one draw back to the book is that the authors skipped over the highly important microcosmic research of r. gordon wasson which was available at the time . a tying together of these two works ( hamlet 's mill and soma ) , as jenkins discovered ( maya cosmogenesis <NUM> ) , can not be over looked and is a most rewarding discovery . a solid <NUM> star work
i 've got a few of the colosseum cd 's and i 've never been terribly impressed with them ... but this incarnation of the band is something else entirely . they take a much more rock approach and prog it out with fantastic results . the pace is driving and speeds along with purpose and supreme musicianship . every song is full of intricate time changes , killer solos , and great vocals . the second disc is a fine addition to the original . there 's no sign of a filler cut ... it 's all outstanding stuff ! a nice surprise , overall . i 'm hooked
alright , im sure you already know what its about , if not , then just read above , because im here , trying to tell you why you should watch it . i know , ill get this out of the way fast . just watch this movie for what it is , not what you want it to be ! people argue that its not scary , or that the twist ending was horrible . its not a horror movie , its not suposed to scare you . its a love story . and listen to this : the twist ending ? , its not suposed to be a surprise , its suposed form this whole movie , its suposed to define who these characters are , and what they are trying to do . this is a story of love , and of hope and innocence . i just dont see how people who are fans of shyamalans other movies can say `` i hated the ending , very predictable '' because , fans , you know what shyamalan does , you know from seeing signs that hes a deep writer , that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be . so please , if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics , or your friends , then see it anyway . why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like , or dont like ? sure , many didnt like it , some didnt even understand it , but that doesnt mean you wont like it . you just have to try it out . if you havent had the end ruined for you , thats even better , because you still have this whole movie to look forward to , and if you dont enjoy it , than fine , but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it . i know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews . if you enjoy a good love story , or even an art-sy type of suspence movie , then im sure you will enjoy it . but its not for everyone . im sure , if you get bored easily , or if you dont have an imagination ( this is a must have for any shyamalan film ) and then theres the soundtrack , which deserves <NUM> stars all by itself because its so magical . shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film , who can make the music be a character in the movie . but before i leave , trust me , dont watch this thinking its a horror movie , because its not . thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film
when i first obtained partners in crime by j.a . jance , i had no idea the story was taking place in bisbee , in cochise co. , arizona , which only added delight to my reading enjoyment . i lived in sierra vista which is also in cochise co. a few years ago , and i must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location . for me it was a step back in time . which made it a <NUM> star for me . i came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall , which was a choking situation . maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles . it was refreshing to find a female sheriff in bisbee , az , it being a macho town like so many of the border towns . however sheriff joanna brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered rochelle , who was in the witness protection program ; a second murder , and having to share the investigation with beaumont . i enjoyed the mystery ; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me .
i learned a great deal from herr doktor gershom scholem ( 1897-1982 ) through his text , & quot ; on the kabbalah and its symbolism & quot ; . dr bernard mcginn , divinity school , university of chicago , wrote in the introduction , & quot ; i believe that all students of mysticism should read scholem , not only for his profound insights into the jewish mystical tradition , but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- christian , islamic , and even those further afield. & quot ; professor scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches . & quot ; from an historical point of view & quot ; , he writes , & quot ; the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others. & quot ; within this context , this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries . in the first chapter , & quot ; religious authority and mysticism & quot ; herr doktor scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research , & quot ; there is no mysticism as such , but only the mysticism of particular religious systems , christian , islamic and jewish mysticism , and so on & quot ; . the mystic working within a religious system is , according to scholem , at the same time both conservative and revolutionary . & quot ; conservative & quot ; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority , and & quot ; revolutionary & quot ; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority . in the second chapter , titled , & quot ; the meaning of the torah in jewish mysticism & quot ; , scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the torah and the mystic . scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the torah are based : ( <NUM> ) ywvh ; ( <NUM> ) torah as oganism ; ( <NUM> ) infinite meaning of the divine word . as an example of the third , in addition to the the concept of written and oral torahs , the author of the & quot ; zohar & quot ; speculates four levels of meaning : ( <NUM> ) literal ( <NUM> ) hermeneutic ( <NUM> ) allegorical and ( <NUM> ) mystical . the history of judaism , scholem explains in the third chapter , is a tension between the purity of the reality of god . the dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of god 's purity is the loss of her living reality . scholem offers that the book bahir , a cornerstone of 12th century kabbalistic thought , introduces myth into judaism . remarkably , it contends evil as an attribute of god . in a similar vein , the commentary on the sefer yetzirah by judah ben barzilai introduced speculative thinking to jewish theosophy . the fourth chapter , & quot ; tradition and new creation in the ritual of the kabbalists & quot ; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation . namely , how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium . the mishnal codified jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries . as the agrarian society diminished , the torah became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful , historical rituals . the spanish kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions . scholem writes , & quot ; the rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols , even when these are 'spiritualized ' and transformed into speculative constructions. & quot ; r. yanassan gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the golem . i will take the liberty to direct you to his comments . if you are interested in historical issues of the kabbalah , this is essential reading for you
i grew up on dylan ... in fact , dylan is my middle name . i was very intimate with his songs from a very early age . when i bought this album in the early '90s , i was still in high school . at first , i remember thinking that his voice was gone . i did n't think i could listen to the entire album . i struggled through it and put it on a shelf . from time to time , i forced myself to listen to it . i do n't know exactly when the change took place ... i suppose i grew up a bit , musically . good as i been to you started to take shape . the guitar ... the harp ... the voice . all of a sudden , it meant something entirely different . it made sense . it all came together . now , fourteen years later , i listen to this album at least once a week . i will not hesitate to say that this is a great album . but , for some reason , it needs to grow on you . it builds up to some subtle crescendo . then , suddenly , it will hit you like a ton of bricks . dylan knew exactly what he was doing . this is his re-entry into greatness after a few years astray . the guitar picking is incredible . his voice could n't be more appropriate for the content . if you need more proof , just look at what the ( rare ) vinyl form of this album can fetch . i recently acquired the lp , and it is the most expensive one in my collection ! those 'in the know ' really know what this album is worth . give it a try ... then try it again . let the guitar flow through you for a while . sing along . go ahead and try . it 's not that easy . you 'll soom see why this is one of dylan 's greatest albums . i say that as a hard-core dylan fan , so do n't take it lightly
for a buck you can certainly toss this in with whatever else you 're ordering this trip . rwe is one of the great articulators of the american mind . for better or worse , here 's a distilled vision of what we think . rwe 's positive and powerful view of human thought can be uplifting , though some may occasionally experience a desire to snort & quot ; oh , puh-lease ! & quot ; a great source of pithy quotes and sharp insights , rwe also provides considerable depth if you wade all the way into his works . everyone should have some collection of emerson on the shelf , and this collection hits all the high points ( though it is not , it should be said , a good choice for those suffering from chronic eyestrain )
in the midst of widower ( mortician ? ) ( colin firth ) , cedric brown 's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny , hairy warts and all . with her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth , she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane . if childrearing were this easy , us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick ! ( i noticed emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere ) . can i please borrow it , ms. thompson ? my daughter and i were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself , emma thompson . it was loosely based on christianna brand 's nurse matilda books , and who better to play the plum role of nanny mcphee , than ms. thompson ? one thing though , did disappoint me . nanny mcphee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end -- that my daughter and i wondered why mr. brown could n't have married her ? angela lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity aunt adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced mr. brown into taking a bride . it was hilarious how , while he was wooing the opportunist mrs. quickly ( celia imrie ) , his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things . colin firth as mr. brown was dynamic . so was the scullery maid evangeline ( kelly macdonald ) . and , in the end , everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale , snow in august , and all . kirk jones , directed . beware of dark undertones if you 're wary of witchcraft . this review refers to the dvd
tempest expertly infuses ballads and reels with rock , giving traditional folk music a new energy as well as contributing some original pieces that are equally timeless . i like this album even better than their last ( titled & quot ; balance & quot ; ) . though each track is distinct and stands well on its own , they all complement one another and play almost seamlessly as a whole . maybe i 'm partial since i first heard tempest live as the current ensemble of musicians , but i think newcomer violinist sue draheim 's harmony vocals add a sweet texture the previous album did not have . then again , there 's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads . at any rate , having seen some of tempest 's live performances , i can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy . listening to this album is like gathering around a home fire and being entertained by a captivating storyteller . definitely worth hearing ... again and again
though based on the famous character in phil silver 's famous oldie tv show , the new `` sergeant bilko '' is less an homage to that show than it is to the classic steve martin of his <NUM> 's days . though this bilko ( again a shifty and tireless grafter , the evil face of non-coms everywhere ) is very much the opportunist that silvers ' character was ( he runs the base casino ) , as shy of risk as silvers was ( the unit 's mobilization orders for desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) and manages to get caught in his own dealings as silvers had ( bilko botches the fixing of an army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer to think he 's the one who 's supposed to take a fall ) the screwball zaniness is very much out of steve martin 's snl days . the script has bilko 's unit charged with testing a brand new army weapon - a `` hovertank '' that is soon to be cancelled because , among other things , it simply does n't work . that the hovertank 's end will spell doom for his own cozy position does n't seem to bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when the officer charged with evaluating the hovertank turns out to be the fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made an enemy of thorn by accidentally implicating him in one of his bitched schemes . now a major , thorne is n't simply content enough to eliminate the hovertank , but must now axe bilko as well . they say that desperate times reveal the man , and bilko is now revealed to be the spineless weasel his troops have come to love . martin plays bilko like a character from one of his old snl skits . it 's sort of fun to watch the guy work on material we have n't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( `` la story '' , `` roxanne '' ) and more mature dramatic roles ( `` the spanish prisoner '' , `` grand canyon '' and that update of `` silas marner '' ) . it 's light and breezy and you 'll probably forget most of the gags , and the script under-uses most of the supporting cast ( especially the now late-great phil hartman as bilko 's evil nemesis ) , but it 's still fun
after churning out psychedelic sludge with vanilla fudge , bassist tim bogert and drummer carmine appice joined the blues-rock gold rush of the early '70s . entertaining in a spinal tap way , cactus spew fantastic riffs as strutting metalhead rusty day plays badass frontman . `` rockout , whatever you feel like '' is a best song of the ages.best album in years fantastic best as it gets
this group is very consistent . this cd is as good as their others . i ca n't wait to see them in concert in san francisco in october
when green day changed up their sound around the mid-90 's and came through with a more slickly produced , commercial sound , a lot of their loyal fans did n't like it . but what they seemingly forgot to look at amidst their curious anger is that green day 's new stuff sounded really good ( 'warning ' especially ) , even though , yeah , it sounded quite a bit different . when it comes to bob dylan , die-hard fans compare an album like empire burlesque ( and probably a couple before it ) with the likes of highway <NUM> revisited and bringing it all back home , and a lot of them not only do n't like the change but are agitated with their sneaky hero , though his status as 'constantly-looked-up-to ' remains in tact . granted , as much as i like empire burlesque , it has to be careful with itself because as it goes from one song to the next you almost feel like you 're going to hear this as a soundtrack for a really syrupy cameron crowe movie , and that 's no good . but dylan 's sensibilty does n't go quite that far down the wimpy direction as he remains hard-hearted and overly introspective , even if fairly non-sensical at times . i love songs like 'tight connection to my heart ' ' i 'll remember you ' 'emotionally yours ' and 'never gon na be the same again . ' though the disk sounds slicker than usual , it 's a mistake to think the authenticity level dropped at all . if anything , he seems to be connecting with these songs at a higher degree than what is usual with him . another great thing about this album is that it 's pretty consistent . a couple of the tunes are slighter but none of them are bad and they 're all at least a litte above mediocre , with a high portion of it ranging from good to excellent . and that 's saying a lot for someone like dylan , who is so terribly inconsistent . not long ago i listend to planet waves and there are 2-3 outrageously listenable songs there but so much of it is so mediocre . i 've always thought dylan likes being disliked and that 's why he puts out such terrible songs intermingled with all the stuff that 's good . he does n't want people coming too close and that desire of his seems to draw his fans near all the more . i saw dylan in concert last year and he was on keyboards due to some kind of arthritis , or something . there was a guitar planted on the center of the stage and after every song dylan walked over , with his back hunched over and his shoulders sulking , his white warm-up suit and cowboy hat making him look like a modern-day texas circus hand . once there he would walk around the vicinity of the guitar and oftentimes the crowd 's screaming would peak , but every time dylan did not pick up the guitar and instead slowly meandered over to his keyboards . not once did he pick up the guitar that night but he led the audience to believe he would about 15-20 times . what a tease . on empire burlesque he seems to have softened up and not minded creating something nice all the way through . and those strange actions of his which somehow draw his worshipers ever nigher are absent here , and i 'm thankful for that
i think everyone should go and buy this book . it is worthy of <NUM> stars.this book trys to help you become a better writer by sharing some of ralph fletcher 's experiances . if you like this book i reccomend you read spider boy or a writer 's notebook . ( the book before live writing
i purchased this book for my <NUM> year old who needed it for a school project . the vocabulary used in this book is a bit difficult . i also found it to be quite different than the disney movie and other written versions of the story . the author , felix salten , uses elaborate descriptions and you will feel as if you are actually in the woods with the deer ! i recommend this book , but please be aware that it is not `` sugar coated '' like the movie
just by saying this has been quite a year for the veteran crooner would be an understatement in itself . barry manilow began <NUM> with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at # <NUM> last february with the greatest songs of the fifties . in between that album release and this , he has continued to sell out his las vegas extravaganza , music and passion , five nights a week . the show is so successful that the las vegas hilton recently extended manilow 's contract through <NUM> . he picked up his second emmy award this past august for the live on tape broadcast of that event , and with the release of this album , he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his <NUM> year recording career . barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of <NUM> to have two top two records in billboard in one calendar year . when it came to recording his follow-up to the `` fifties , '' juggernaut , it did n't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be . all it took was clive davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go . for the critics who have tarred and feathered manilow since he hit # <NUM> with his very first single , `` mandy '' over three decades ago , you 'd think by this time they 'd cut him some slack . no dice . manilow has even admitted he would n't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic , the brooklyn-born writer , arranger , producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase . and it 's not just any fanbase . these people are hardcore fans , dubbed `` fanilows . '' on this cd , we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the <NUM> 's one of the best eras in pop music history . the pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from bacharach to the beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of frankie valli 's `` ca n't take my eyes off of you , '' which kicks the disc off into high gear . other highlights among highlights include a duet with <NUM> 's supergroup , the association , on their staples `` cherish '' and `` windy '' that barry cleverly arranged as a medley . elvis ' gorgeous <NUM> ballad `` ca n't help falling in love '' is lusciously delivered as is the righteous brothers <NUM> anthem `` you 've lost that lovin ' feelin ' . '' even the somewhat hokey # <NUM> dean martin single `` everybody loves somebody '' from <NUM> fits in divinely as manilow gives it as much warmth as dino did over forty years ago . sinatra 's smash hit from <NUM> , `` strangers in the night '' is so effective , franks ' daughter , tina , gave manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation . other pop staples included are the herman 's hermits `` there 's a kind of hush , '' bacahrach 's gorgeous song from '68 `` this guy 's in love with you , as well as his '69 oscar-winner `` raindrops keep falling on my head . '' the beatles shimmering <NUM> ballad `` and i love her '' and bobby vinton 's <NUM> `` blue velvet '' is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the <NUM> love anthem `` when i fall in love '' originally a hit for the lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching . the album ends on a positive note ( pun intended ) with the <NUM> anthem for hope `` what the world needs now is love . '' never was that sentiment so true - never was a manilow album this gratifying . everything from song selections to manilow 's masterful arrangements to his honest readings , this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career . look for the greatest songs of the seventies inside a year . it does n't take a fortune teller to figure that one out
crackerjack suspense yarn by kurosawa based on the novel king 's ransom by ed mcbain . toshiro mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product ( shoes ) for a bigger profit ; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe . but then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded , only it turns out to be not his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time , his chauffeur 's son . he 's faced with a moral dilemma : should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially , or not ? he decides to pay and get the boy back ; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper . at this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural . the kidnapper 's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer . mifune is ruined at the end , but public support is behind him . it 's a great crime drama ; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit . what i found most fascinating was how differently the japanese police handled the case from the way american police might - so much more compassionately . definitely worth a watch
this movie features john wayne not as a cowboy but as a football coach . it is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of john wayne , comedy . it is a good movie though . when i first watched it i was amazed . everyone ( from wayne to the actress that plays his daughter ) does an excellent job . john wayne 's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player , and he also played football at usc for a couple of years with ward bond . so it is a subject he knows well . overall , it gives light to a new side of the duke , the comical side ( which is n't bad ) . it is n't one of the best , i grant you , but it is great because it shows duke 's acting talents with a great script and cast
ok , so let 's talk about the music and the performance on this eagles concert hd-dvd . nothing but awesome ! just what i 'd expect from these boys . twenty-five , or so , songs , performed live with studio-quality sound perfection and singular performances by each and every member of this beloved american band ! the hd-dvd cinematography , lighting , and color is beautiful - almost better than being there . pretty much all of the songs you remember and love the eagles for ; ya know - hotel california , tequilla sunrise , take it easy , .... etc . some new stuff as well . joe walsh sings a good new upbeat tune about zoning through his earlier life due to alcohol . lots of fun , big excited audience , great horn section , superb backup drummer , guitarist , keyboards . my only complaint is about the direction with respect to guitar playing - i really wanted to see more about how walsh and their other awesome guy ( do n't know his name ) made those awesome sounds . oh well . now , about hd-dvd players : i got the xbox <NUM> hd-dvd add-on . it was sub-standard , imo . i returned it and got the real deal toshiba stand-alone hd-dvd player with the independent analog audio inputs ( you 've got to get the analog surround inputs if you want to really experience hd-dvd sound on the recent toshiba players ) . so get real and get a dedicated hd-dvd player and check out those eagles ! i have a <NUM> '' screen front projection hd projector , <NUM> watt pioneer sound box , and about $ <NUM> worth of full size 7.1 surround speakers . it rally gets me in the `` zone . '' but you do n't need this much equipment to enjoy this great eagles hd-dvd - just a dedicated hd-dvd player . btw , if you love music , only the hd-dvd standard requires technically superior sound on each and every hd-dvd released - not so on blu-ray . so go hd-dvd
this spectacular and powerful singing and dance performance ( and the excellent commentaries ) telling the story of the fire goddess , pele , and her sister hiiaka , gives deep insights into hawaiian culture and religious belief and is wonderful to watch . for me it helps keep alive memories of my own visit to hawaii and the volcanoes national park . should be of interest to anyone who loves traditional dance and/or mythology .
i first saw this movie on release as a teenager , and thought it was a great scary movie . the main reason i bought it now was to get a hold of the great jerry mulligan soundtrack . the whole family have enjoyed the film now , and leaving out the <NUM> 's gear and hairstyles , its a great thriller
as a matter of fact , i must say my first real love was star wars chronicles , first edition from <NUM> , not only because of my likeness for the old trilogy , but because of the data and images about characters , weapons , landscapes , behind-the-scenes images you can find in the great book . now i must say , i was interested in this new book just because i read the names and credentials of the authors although my interest in this new george lucas creation is not my favorite trilogy and i could say something about it . then i thought , `` well , maybe today 's young kids will love this second trilogy more than the first one , and their hearts will bit for darth maul even more than for darth vader '' . if someone had to write this book , there 's no other choice than these huge star wars knowledgemen , these fanfiles yodas . now , star wars chronicles the prequels is a `` had to be written '' book and it 's absolutelly amazing with its more than <NUM> images about the prequels , all those characters , all those ships , all those light sabers ... all those worlds . now , star wars chronicles , tp has won a proudly place beside my old and dusty star wars chronicles . do n't you doubt it : this book is your next `` need to have '' . and why do n't i give it a <NUM> star rate ? i think chronicle books should think a bit on spanish translation for this wideworld phenomena book . i 'm absolutely sure they will reach a really important market here . darth khan
even though this was one of prince 's underrated movies , i still love it . the dvd version includes all of the music videos ( some in color ) that were released in reference to the soundtrack . this was ingenious for the marketability of this dvd . way to go
following a worldwide plague , robert neville may be the only man left alive . his family is dead . all the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out , attack him , and drink his blood . holed up in his home , which he has converted into a safe house , robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status , the constant need to seek shelter , food and protection , and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague . a combination of science fiction and horror , i am legend is an atmospheric , stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept : the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire . the book is short and difficult to put down , well paced , both intelligent and frightening , and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres . i highly recommend it , and i consider it one of the most interesting books that i have ever read . this read through of i am legend was my first time coming back to it since i read it in high school ( now almost four years ago ) . the story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years -- or , more precisely , the science of matheson 's conception of vampires . coming back to the text , it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly . for the most part , this narrative is a method of conveying matheson 's sci-fi concepts -- perhaps like any true sf author , he puts scientific concept ahead of character , and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story 's scientific concept has on them . in the case of i am legend , that concept is a scientific and ( mostly ) logical explanation for vampires . and it 's a wonderful , brilliant concept , more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years . i still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail , making the end of the book feel a little too fast -- nonetheless , the concept is a great one , and very interesting to read about . the flips side of that situation , however , is that the book lacks characterization and emotion . those aspects are n't entirely absent by any means . robert , the protagonist , has a back story , goes through emotional phases , and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in . he 's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable . nonetheless , these personal characteristics and even his interactions , past and present , exist primarily to move towards , expound on , and explain matheson 's scientific point , his conception of the vampires . in some cases , this is obvious : richard 's memories serve to build his character , but they also serve to lead him , and thus the reader , to a better understanding of the vampires . at a mere <NUM> pages , matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character -- not so that it overwhelmed his sf ideas , but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book . the lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result . despite these thoughts and critiques , i greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it . matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in i am legend , one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown . his sf concepts are detailed , intelligent , and truly absorbing . the book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that i have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read . i highly recommend the text , and it 's a good one to own -- although short and easily readable , it 's wonderful to come back to and reread . it also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/halloween text . i have n't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version , and so i ca n't speak for those
i fell in love with this guide after unhappily perusing the lonely planet , time out , let 's go , and other assorted guides to the city . i 'm in the proces of moving to boston , so i did n't want chapters and chapters about hostels and tourist meccas and boston history ( for that , i 'll buy a real book ) . mainly , i wanted something i could use to get myself around the city and figure out the neighborhoods ( looking for an apartment from a few thousand miles away is n't that easy , let me tell you , espcially when you have no idea where all the places are , and the local bookstore was n't stocking any 'moving to boston ' books ) . so this little black guidebook , hiding out behind frommer 's guide to new england , was a blessing . the main difference -- and advantage -- this guide has over the others is that it is map-based rather than text-based . each section of the city has about three maps in the book , one showing essentials ( banks , hostpitals , landmarks , libraries , schools , and of course , donuts ) , one showing sundries/entertainment ( bars , coffee , copy shops , gyms , liquor stores , movie theatres , restaurants , and shopping ) , and a final covering transportation ( subway , bus lines ( ! ) , car rental , and parking ) ; of course , all the streets are labeled as well . this alone would have made me buy the guide , but behind these maps , the guide discusses the parks , convention centers , ballparks -- and provides floorplans for them if you ever want to buy tickets for events . it has listings for universities and colleges , it explains the commuter rail , amtrak , how to get to the stations . it has a full page of 24-hour services ! ! ( something i 've found severely lacking in other guides ) it lists libraries , hospitals , police stations , boston movies , books , songs , art galleries , it has floor plans of theatres ! ! three pages of bookstores ! a full street index ( like in the best city maps , london a to z ) , a fold-out highway/driving map of downtown ... gasp . this is possibly the most perfect guide to boston i could think of , the guide i would have written and designed if i were a guidebook writer . and one of the best , coolest things is that there is a little elastic band on the back cover so you can hold the thing closed ( and , by extension , put stuff in the book and then keep it there so it 's not falling out , like in a moleskin notebook , if you know what i mean . very useful for notes and reservation sheets and tickets ) . the book itself is extremely compact , probably <NUM> by <NUM> inches ( ? ) , which means that the type is very small ( i 'd estimate about 7pt ? ) , so that might be the one thing some people might have a problem with . myself , i am a big fan of the size ( of the guide and the font ) because then there 's just that much more you can fit into a small space
i purchased this set for my husband after hearing him talk about it for quite some time . he is thrilled with it and plays it quite often . it is apparently a 'must have ' for any springsteen fan
full metal jacket is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen . although the language is too strong for many people ( not for me ) , it definately puts the point across about the harsh life of marines during training on the island . the sniper scene is very well done as well . gunnery sergeant hartman is portrayed by an excellent actor who is able to scream obscenities at his troops without even cracking a smile , i would like to see the bloopers reel from full metal jacket
everything and anything you 've ever wanted to know about our oceans . this book is absolutely brimming with facts , myths , mysteries , and tales of the sea
the 1st one is excellent , the second one is blahhhh but funny and fun to watch , the third one is better then the second one but not better then the first one lo
buy this album ! seriously , this is one amazing cd . every single song on this cd is worthy of your purchase . i promise you will not be dissapointed
this <NUM> release by guitarist ralph towner only reaffirms his genius and versatility as a musician/composer . teaming up with bassist eberhard weber , drummer jon christensen and saxophonist jan garbarek , towner took <NUM> other very highly developed musical personalities on a wild ride with him through dark spooky forests ( `` visitation '' ) , vast seas ( `` oceanus '' ) , deserts ( `` sand '' ) and more . towner lets forth some beautiful bill evans-esque piano musings on `` drifting petals '' , and even engages jan garbarek in a lively duo on `` winter solstice '' . things even get funky on `` piscean dance '' . bassist eberhard weber adds not only brilliant electric upright bass lines to the proceedings but goes further to add eerie choruses of cellos and bowed bass . jan garbarek proves a more than capable foil for towners full rich guitars and piano with his stark , icy , yet oddly soulful tones on tenor , soprano and flute . one of his best moments is `` nimbus '' with its tumbling flutes and stern tenor sax interjections . `` visitation '' gets my vote for spookiest track on an ecm release . this improv piece is very effective in conjuring up vivid images of walking through a spooky forest at night , screech owls in full cry and something lurking behind the twisted trees . all throughout , drummer jon christensen provides very flexible and empathetic playing , really listening to what 's going on and giving his all without overpowering the other musicians . he shoud definitely get a mvp award in the ecm stable ( as he 's appeared on so many ecm discs ) . prepare ye for a mindblowing listening experience !
though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody ( dawn of the dead , an american werewolf in london are examples ) , the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative . just like re-animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre , evil dead <NUM> takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the scream/i know what you did last summer/scary movie cash cows . for those who liked the `` tree '' sequence in the first evil dead movie , imagine it being magnified over and over again . using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion , evil dead <NUM> is still wildly imaginative . a person tries to fight off their own severed hand . visions appear from nowhere . the first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving . if you do n't like slasher films ( believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any friday the 13th film , take your pick ) or if you 're one of those old blue haired types ranting about `` video nasties '' then stay away . however , if you want a good , gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then evil dead <NUM> is for you . for real film fanatics , one might note ( though on a far more intellectual level ) the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist ( s ) of the film can also be found ( albeit much more arty and far less gorey ) in the films of jan svankmeyer . as for the casual horror buff , evil dead ii is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with rob zombie 's `` the devil 's rejects '' . leave the lights on
this is based on the book vampire $ by john steakley . james woods is a cynical vampire hunter and leads a team sanctioned by the vatican . but after a job in the southwest things go wrong . suddenly a vampire shows up who is immensely powerful and knows woods by name . in just moments the vampire slaughters everyone present , slayers , cops , prostitutes . only those who were not there survived . to make matters worse , the monsignor in charge of the slayers has arrived from the vatican and wishes to meet with woods . woods is introduced to a new priest for the team and told to assemble and train a new team . but woods is ticked off and wants to know how a vampire can be so powerful and also knows his name . woods does not follow his orders . instead he tries to track down the vampire . it seems this is the original vampire ; the one who spawned the rest . the vampire was created during a botched exorcism and seeks to perform a new ritual that will make him even more powerful and eliminate some of his weaknesses . woods has little time to find the vampire and put a stop to him . woods also has to put up with team members who are in grave danger of turning into vampires themselves . armed with guts , a hatred of vampires , and some modern weaponry woods is all that stands between the world and total domination by vampire . this is a james woods movie pure and simple . sure , it has vampires , action , and women , but it is woods that makes the movie . his character is wonderful . you have to wonder at how desperate the vatican is for slayers to even tolerate woods let alone employ him . the slaying techniques are different , efficient , and very sensible . all in all a pretty fun movie with james woods at his absolute best . fans of joss whedon 's firefly will probably get a kick out of the score which seems to have inspired the music in firefly . check it out
i remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since . the movie starts off at the <NUM> calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b . sweeny ) is a talented hockey player and kate mosley ( moira kelly ) is a pairs figure skater . both have mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering a career ending injury and kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations . the movie picks up a few years later with kate having trouble getting a new partner and doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player . added to the mix is kate 's russian couch anton pamchenko ( played by the great roy dotrice ) who decides rick will be kate 's new partner as they struggle to get back to the <NUM> olympics . at first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating , but that is not entirely so . the scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater . in truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice . it is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another , to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love . the thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads sweeney and kelly . they are magic together on the screen , so much so that i am surprised they never paired up again for another movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone . on a side note about the dvd , the only special feature is the theatrical trailer . there are no deleted scenes . this is where i have a question , because the version of the film on this dvd and that i 've scene on tv in recent years is not the one i remember seeing in college . i distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony . i somewhat like that version because what doug and kate won in that version was so much more . so where is the version with the alternative ending ? ? ?
the great warpath is a comprehensive integration of archaeology and history , the type of book history needs more of to make past subject matter more tangible and believable . ironically , there are surprisingly few works which supplement history with archaeology or vice-versa . with the great warpath starbuck fills the vacancy as he carefully balances the two fields and raises archaeology to a new level of importance . specifically , the book deals with british military history in the late 18th century as starbuck interprets it from his many years as an archaeologist . all the major sights of the french and indian war in new york state are covered , as well as a few sights from the american revolution . the great warpath refers to the hudson river , the main corridor in new york state , along which military engagements of the french and indian war , and the american revolution occured . undoubtedly , the great warpath has something to offer every military historian who is not satisfied solely with the limits of written history
`` when harry met sally '' is one of my favorite films . it 's one of those movies you can watch again and again , and never get sick of it . billy crystal and meg ryan are hilarious , and bruno kirby and carrie fisher are excellent in their supporting roles . i ca n't recommend this movie enough .
only in this masterpiece can you find arnold schwarzeneggar saying `` i 'm not a pervert ! i just wanted the turboman doll , '' `` put the cookie down ! now ! '' and `` rock-'em-sock-'em jet pack ! '' along with classic moments like arnold busting into a radio station , kicking down the door and yelling like a madman to a frightened dj . parents , this is a must buy . you may be able to relate to it , but you 'll probably have more fun laughing at how ridiculous it gets ( you 're children will think you 're laughing at the broad humor ) . the fact that a parade features a working turboman suit complete with jet pack kills me just thinking about it
unfortunately , the <NUM> lands at the northwest corner of the arctic national wildlife refuge do n't have this protection from possible oil drilling , in an area estimated to have oil reserves equal to less than six months of current needs . more unfortunately , the porcupine caribou herd does n't recognize that it is in potential huge danger by coming here to calve every year , as the cows have for time immemorial from this large herd . husband-and-wife heuer and allison gave themselves a belated honeymoon -- follow the herd from its winter grounds to calving area and back , all while documenting it . heuer has worked in national parks programs in canada and south africa and already done yeoman environmental work by hiking the entire yellowstone-to-yukon or y2y corridor to popularize the need for extended wildlife area protections for large mammals . the humor ? the movie starts with clips of george h.w . bush , followed by george w. bush , both saying that they ca n't see the need for caribou protection . so , heuer packs a `` w '' doll with him for the entire journey , so he can see just why the herd needs its calving grounds protected . an incredible journey through rugged land , fighting off cold and variety of incredibly ferocious flying insects , this is a fantastic wildlife effort . pair it with heuer 's book of the same name , and you 'll fall in love with the herd too
good role for crowe , well directed and appears to be fairly accurate of roman empire lif
with all the drek that video stores carry , it 's amazing that i had to join an online rental service to see `` rushmore '' , the best comedy , and one of the most entertaining movies i 've seen this decade . `` rushmore '' has every aspect of a great movie -- script ( by director wes anderson and writer/actor owen wilson ) , casting ( jason schwartzman got the starring part as max fischer after a long search ; bill murray is perfect as herman blume , and brit olivia williams is lovely as miss cross -- i 'm not sure why she has n't gotten other good parts ; even the minor characters are very well cast ) , direction ( by anderson -- highlighted by the montage of max 's extracurricular activities at the title private school rushmore ) , acting ( see schartzman , murray and others ) , soundtrack ( somehow '60s british invasion works perfectly for this tale from the '90s -- the faces `` ooh la la '' topping everything ) , and a happy , but still satisfying ending . and on top of that , there are plenty of very funny lines and the delight of seeing both `` serpico '' and `` platoon '' produced for the high school stage . max fischer is one of the best young characters created for a movie , and the rest of the great cast and production work beautifully around him . very highly recommended !
i 'm reviewing this to raise the avg . star rating . i think this is a decent piece of work that is not intended to be listened to in one sitting . the songs are kinda slow grooves that remind me a lot of traffic at times ; funk keyboards wash over the whole thing and the vocals are almost inaudible whispers . i 'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry , in society , among fellow musicians . i only know that it does n't deserve a three star avg , though it all kind feels like one big song , it 's a real cool , groovy song
this is a thoughtful and well researched book . it answers some of the questions which bother most indians are we aryans or dravidians , how did the indus valley civilization dissappear . the manner in which they explain the myths like the one about the vijayanagar empire tells us about the research put in by the authors . i would recommend this book to novices as well as connosieurs of indian histor
this movie is soo good . i think that anyone will love this movie its funny but also heart-warming !
passion 's way movie is based on the novel `` the reef '' by edith wharton . the american novelist edith wharton spent most of her professional life in europe . `` the reef '' exemplifies her close observation of americans in france , their inner lives and social conflicts . on his way to france to see his beloved , the widowed anna leath ( outstanding perfomance by the always beautiful and talented sela ward ) , charles darrow ( timothy dalton-former james bond ) receives a telegram telling him not to come due to an `` unexpected obstacle . '' as time passes and he does n't receive an explanation for the delay , he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation . as he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to london or to press forward , he encounters sophy viner , a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended . she is on her way to paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career . darrow , who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer , finds himself manipulating sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison . he is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty . four months later , anna leath eagerly anticipates darrow 's arrival . during the walk they had in the garden , anna expresses her love for charles . anna : `` i 'm not a naive young girl . i know ... of course i know ... but there are things a woman feels ... when what she knows does n't make any difference . it 's not that i want you to explain -- i mean about that particular evening . it 's only that i want you to know the whole of my feeling . i did n't know what it was till i saw you again . i never dreamed i should say such things to you ! '' charles : `` i never dreamed i should be here to hear you say them ! but now that you have said it .... the only thing that matters is that we are here together and i want you to be my wife . '' anna is also excited because her stepson , owen leath , wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic , old-fashioned grandmother ; he wants to marry anna 's daughter 's governess , who is none other than sophy viner . darrow and sophy 's secret is safe with one another , yet darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant anna wants him to support owen 's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities . he tries to convince sophy that owen is not right for her . `` you 'd rather i did n't marry any friend of yours , '' she says `` not as a question , but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact . '' she is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions . this is a outsanding movie for people who appreciate understanding the complex nature of human behavior . the movie finishes with these lines : `` what i meant was that when you 've lived a little longer you 'll see what complex blunderers we all are : how we 're struck blind sometimes , and mad sometimes -- and then , when our sight and our senses come back , how we have to set to work , and build up , little by little , bit by bit , the precious things we 'd smashed to atoms without knowing it . life 's just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits . '' overall this movie is a truly outstanding movie with excellent performances .
alan jackson is truly one of the best new country singers around . i enjoyed his version of all of these songs . he actually sings them better than the original singers , farewell party and kiss an angel good morning are so well done . i hope he comes out with another cd of this kind
this could have been a <NUM> star movie because it is hard for me to follow the dialect without subtitles though the acting by the cast was what made up for this . the cinematography is great and was sentimental seeing the coast of cornwall . i saw this movie primarily cause of imogen stubbs playing the part of a tomboy as being plausable because of a boyish figure like hilary swank , who is a hotty too . i found imogen attractive in other roles and was curious as to how i would see her . well it was amusing to watch the scenes where her cover could have been revealed whether or not she was fooling anyone i could not care cause she still looked fine as a woman to me . one particular time was when an instructor was correcting her posture during fencing training at the military academy . later i enjoyed her swordsmanship in a duel that was surprisingly aggressive so that you would not mind having her around alot enjoying life . there is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that imogen had part into that is worth noting
this book holds a lot of thought for only <NUM> pages . franz metcalf takes his knowledge of buddhism to answer now just the big questions of `` life '' , but the smaller questions of daily life . what would buddha do or think about such subjects as failure , anger , road rage , gun control , lying , the environment , eating meat , money , sex , drinking , drug abuse , boredom and even prostitution . hard issues , but each is given a page , answered with a quote from buddhist teaching and advice from the author . great gift for a friend or a gift for yourself . it really helps you strip away the fat and get to the very core of the subject in question
i purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book . without mr. kremer 's book i would have been clueless , however now i am well informed and continue to sell my book . it has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher , which was my main goal . ( i self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling ) i knew the world needed my book and i needed it releasedquick . mission accomplished . i keep <NUM> ways close to my side and continuously consult it as i continue my publishing journey . highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process
though i am not a fan of pop music , the beauty of ofra haza 's voice lured me in . this album has wonderful songs in an almost 80s-style pop music with `` middle eastern '' influence . the lyrics are moving and deeper than typical pop music , complete with a voice that is unique to just about any genre
i have a very special care for this vivaldi 's work . somehow , life has made me aware of many forms of interpretation of this very concert . yesterday i was listening to it and i was aware of some details that made me look for it . i simply knew that the director was asking for wonderful new sounds that are not often to be found in the average performance of this masterwork . often , my favourite version is the one of `` i musici '' . yet i was n't too surprised to find it was osawa the conducer of this amazing version . i had had the chance of listening to previous works by him and i realize how he manages to make a classical always present . if he is the director of this record , no doubt , it is worthwile
intriguing movie with as many layers as an onion . there is also a surprising , rare commentary by star val kilmer ( one of the most under rated actors of the day ) in which he alternately teases and admires with warmth , director david mamet ( `` dav-eed mam-ay '' ) , as well as the black ops/rangers-types he plays in spartan . best to go into the film unspoiled and be surprised , several times over . for anyone who loves espionage with a twist , this one wo n't disappoint
i was very uncertain what to expect from this band and after i had borrowed it from the library it lay on my desk for quite some time and then i was like , it ca n't hurt to listen to it , so i did . it is good , but not as good as i had expected . the females vocals are a bit weak and the lyrics are not their strong point . then why do i give it four stars . well , the sound , and vibe are great and one starts to think back on <NUM> 's pop and it is a blend of <NUM> 's pop and modern rock . the book-let is shoddy with terrible photographs that seem to have been shot by a <NUM> year old kid and what is up with that hair . it is called using a comb ... ? even so , this is a good debut album that has some issues ..
this is a cute dvd about going to the doctor . my <NUM> yewar old enjoys arthur and loves this dvd
maha means great and yoga means a path of reunion . here the great path is outlined and explained in a truly timeless and masterful way . written by a direct disciple of the great ramana maharshi , this is a very important guide book for the seeker of ultimate reality . first published in <NUM> , with numerous printings since then , this book is as fresh and new as a perfect spring morning . chapters include the sage , the world , god , the quest , the egoless state , and much more . for the modern day nondualist seeker , this is a treasure chest of spiritual wisdom . the author declares that we all , consciously or unconsciously , are always looking for the supreme beatitude of the egoless state , i.e. , direct knowledge of the one , the self . to quote a bit from the book : & quot ; the right thing to do is not to go on framing questions and seeking answers ... but to arrest the culprit , the ego , put him in the dock , and dispose of him by the quest of the real self , which he pretends to be . in other words , one should discover the real self , who is the final answer to all questions . every question that arises is vitiated by the ignorance which takes the ego at its face value , as the real self . all questions are therefore reducible to one , 'who am i ? ' . this question is the quest of the self , by which the egoless state is won. & quot ; for the person who 's ears are ready to hear , this book is sweet music indeed ! !
this first scene of this film caught my attention immediately , it was sort of telling me `` sit tight and pay attention jenny . '' `` sólo mía ' is another film about gender violence in the family . it adopts a totally different attitude to the subject matter when compared with icíar bollaín 's film which is at once more subtle in its telling . ` sólo mía ' shoves the nitty-gritty between your teeth so that you can choke on it : some of the scenes are too explicit , one might argue , and are numerously frequent ; in ` te doy mis ojos ' the hard subject matter is more carefully handled . however , paz vega , who starred in ` lucía y el sexo ' ( qv ) the same year , put in a recommendable performance as the badly beaten and tortured young mother ; sergi lópez as her husband plays his part well , though at times seemed to over forcefully portray his performance , thus almost beggaring belief . it should be said that his role was very tricky , to say the least . i feel that luis tosar carried off his performance in ` te doy mis ojos ' more convincingly , with better balancing between the extremes of tensions and feelings . the rest of the cast form a good back-up to the leading couple . this film also points an accusing finger at the legal system , in which hypocritical legalities and aloofness does little - or nothing - to help solve this horrifying situation so evident today in so many headlines in spain today . something has got to be done : more than <NUM> women were killed in ` gender violence ' in spain in <NUM> . at the end it 's a great film , i truly admire european cinema that does n't sugar coat their films . highly recommended .
scrubs continues it 's trek onward from it 's humble beginnings in the third season . the first season revolved around everything from jd coping with being a doctor , to turk and carla beginning their relationship , to jd and elliot 's crazy relationship . season two continued from there and even expanding upon it . jd and elliot hooked up again . turk and carla became even more close . dr. cox even gets thrown in the mix a lot more with the storyline of him getting back with jordan . that brings us to season three . following up on two tremendous season is n't easy and they , in my opinion , succumb to the pressure somewhat . of the three seasons released on dvd so far , this season is my least favorite . never fear though . season three still has plenty of laughs , plenty of guest appearances ( michael j . fox will probably go down as my favorite ) , and you get to know the entire cast even more . all these things make for a memorable season , but in some cases they seem to have backed themselves into a corner . there 's more than a fair share of laughs along the way , be it the janitor becoming a security guard , cox dealing with his child , turk and carla basically becoming one person ( funnier than it sounds ) , elliot 's rekindling flame of season one 's sean , and jd 's continued troubles of being a doctor/lover . everything is funny , just a notch below seasons one and two . overall , yes , this could 've been better ( episode wise , extras are amazing as always ) , but i 'm still happy with what we 've been given . the cliffhanger is a good one and i look forward to seeing even more scenarios continued in season four 's dvd release
this is a little cheesey but , the movie is a classic . it 's a rather touching movie if you focus on the plot
very nostalgic . when i was a kid , photographs was the first song i ever heard true `` stereo '' on . listening almost <NUM> years later , half the songs are pretty good , have are really kind of lousy , but the nostalgia is all great !
with the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball , steven travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport , but the day to day lives of bonds and his peers . as a former professional baseball player , travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective . additionally , travers attended and graduated from usc during the time bonds played at arizona state ( pac-10 ) . as such , travers is not only a writer , but a fan . travers not only documents bond 's achievement of becoming baseball 's all-time single season homerun champion , but he touches on bond 's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media . ultimately , the reader soon realizes that travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at ; that is , he was able to garner the respect and support of bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world . as a former pac-10 pitcher at usc who battled bonds on many occasions , i found traver 's insight very refreshing and commendable . i found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.

i am a relative newcomer to the world of adam dalgliesh , both in print and in film . i had read both this novel and a predecessor , ' a certain justice , ' and came across this film as it was presented over a two-night episode of pbs 'mystery ! . ' i am , as it bears mentioning , completely unfamiliar with the work of roy marsden in this role , and so approach this presentation with relatively fresh eyes . ( although , i doubt i would have enjoyed his performance having been completely captivated by 'the sandbaggers . ' ) shaw 's presentation of dalgliesh is understated , and most definitely contemplative . those looking for melodrama will be deeply disappointed . the film retains all the essential elements of the novel , and most of the subtext usually lost in novel to film translations is pleasantly preserved in this rendition . certain motivations of the secondary characters are truncated , but this is a necessary convention of the form , and is not done capriciously or in disservice to the overall narrative . my only complaint is the presentation of the actual physical church building . given its importance in the overall story , more effort could have been made to create a more imposing , reverant , and solemn atmosphere of this crucial location . as this is but a minor quibble , i hardily recommend this production , and give it four stars
just the cookbook i was looking for . many wonderful recipes that do n't use ingredients not kept in the pantry
i like the muppet movies and my favorite is the muppets take manhattan which i found to be cute and funny . i originally had this movie on video , the pan and scan video tape and i also had the video tapes for the other muppet movies but i gave them to my little cousins and then i bought the widescreen dvd for the the muppets take manhattan and i coould n't be happier with the dvd and now i just have to buy the dvd , s for the muppet movie and the great muppet caper and the new dvd 's for muppet treasure island and the muppets christmas carol . btw : i did n't buy my muppets take manhattan dvd from amazon . i bought it in walmart for <NUM> dollars
if you do n't already have this book , get it . it will not be a duplicate of something you already have . my wife and i saw critters we did n't know existed , and we 're both passionate about critters . the author has a great writing style , the photography is excellent , the book covers a broad diversity of fauna . it 's not a field guide , not a biology text , it 's fun and it 's top notch . i envy a previous reviewer that has been out on field trips with this guy
what a great lesson in perserverance -- kids will be eager to create their own works of art in the backyard . andy is amazing and this dvd is pure beauty
too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on cds like this . john rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting . the music overwhelms the senses and the joy of christmas overcomes you as you listen . this is one of the most peaceful christmas cds i have ever heard . `` wassail song '' is incredible , and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble , this song is a must to perform . you will not be disappointed when you purchase this cd
written by playwright noel coward , directed by david lean , starring celia johnson and trevor howard , and set to the impassioned music of rachmaninoff 's concerto no . <NUM> , this is a story about two people living quietly dull lives , married to equally dull spouses , who suddenly find someone interesting to share a brief encounter with . this masterful film shows how hungry normal , ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting , and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with . the normal avenue for such a relationship would have been their own spouses ; but they are unable to find it there , somehow . so they find it one day , accidentally , illicitly , secretly , dishonestly , soul wrenchingly in a stranger . now these quietly dull souls become quietly desperate souls , as they realize that stolen love comes with a price , and that what had promised to bring them boundless happiness is instead bringing them more sorrow than they have ever known before . i found many parallels in this movie with other quietly desperate people that i know : friends of mine who have tried to find happiness illicitly , secretly , dishonestly in work , sex , alcohol , drugs , co-dependent relationships , etc . i think this movie has a powerful message for our times . it is not about a love relationship that was doomed because of a stricter social and moral code than we have today ; it is about the emptiness and madness of stolen love of any kind . i love the way the film ends , with repentance , forgiveness and reconciliation . this film is a timeless gem . waitsel smit
after his successful debut , ja rule did n't take no time whipping up his second album . `` rule 3:36 '' spawned the hit singles , `` between me and you '' and `` put it on me .

the creators of this film had no ceilings on their vision of what they could bring to life when tackling the process of transforming the depths of the screenplay into the heights of a multidimensional cinematic experience . if you can see this on a big screen , do it . with shades of `` the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover , '' tarsem singh , the director , has fashioned his genius with his crew 's technical refinement . the movie itself is worth owning for the following reasons : vince vaughn and vincent d'onofrio on the same screen at the same time , two great actors in two great roles ; jennifer lopez way outside the box -- jlo only peaks out three times when her accent creeps back in on a few words ; the stunning visuals and special effects rival only those of `` what dreams may come ; '' this is tarsem singh 's directorial debut and it displays the mastery of his vocation ; and finally , the screenplay itself would have made a fascinating plot line under any direction , but auspiciously came to life under the wing of tarsem singh . warning : plot spoilers ahead . jennifer lopez is a psychologist who uses breakthrough neurological technology to enter the subconscious mind of a comatose child and then that of a serial killer , played by vincent d'onofrio . however , she has never tried `` reversing the feed , '' which involves bringing the other person into her subconscious mind because of the emotional dangers of such a mind merge . the highlight of the entire movie is when , against the will of her superiors , she decides to do this anyway and brings the killer into her own world where he appears as his little boy self . the incredible battle she must wage between bestowing compassion for the torture he endured from his father in childhood and delivering justice for the torture he has inflicted on innocent women as an adult comes climactically to fruition in a sequence of tragically requested and tragically rendered mercy . the terrible beauty of the death of suffering is brilliantly written , acted , directed and produced in a denoument that is priceless and at the very least worth the cost of the dvd . vincent d'onofrio is a gift to the screen and tarsem singh a gift to both actor and audience . enjoy this film even more the second time for its exploration of innocence versus experience , mercy versus justice , and life versus death
this is the one ! the other dvd collections for seasons <NUM> , <NUM> & <NUM> were pretty funny ( ok ... some of the funniest stuff of all time , especially `` druggachusetts , '' and `` the chip on the shoulder club '' ) but the fourth season was when it all came together . it does n't get any better than the episode called `` show me your weenis ! '' the first time i saw this , in <NUM> when it first aired , i realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent , over-the-top american comedy . surreal , sharp , better than any british zaniness , and full of bizarre ideas like `` furniture for the blind '' that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices ; and the all-time greatest , `` wyckyd scepter , '' which must be seen to be believed . bob and dave , you are so naked ! better than monty python any day of the week . better than any other so-called `` comedy '' series i can think of . if you get only one of the mr. show dvd sets , get this one .
jefferson airplane tried hard , on this <NUM> utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic surrealistic pillow . having made rca millions of dollars with pillow , the airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the sixties . listening to after bathing at baxter 's is literally a trip . bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques , sound montages , and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination . everything goes , and so it went at baxter 's . it was all new , avant-garde to excess , and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential . most art does fail , but there 's no question that baxter 's cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles . the influence of baxter 's can be heard in `` revolution <NUM> '' by the beatles , and on many other recordings of the era . baxter 's may have sold poorly , but it was heard by the airplane 's contemporaries , and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration . an aficionado 's album , after bathing at baxter 's is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today .
hes great to listen to , his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # <NUM> is my fave
i received this book at my 60th birthday party ( which was a weekend with women only -30 of us - at a cottage in the canadian mountains ) . everyone autographed it and wrote something to me in it just like in the <NUM> 's with your highschool yearbooks . each woman picked out a page and just wrote what she felt or thought . i also shared it with my friends who could n't come to the party and they also signed it happily and sincerely . there are many autographs and lines written throughout the book and i still look through the pages with enjoyment . women of all walks of life , all circumstances , all levels of inner and outer beauty featured within its pages - just like my friends . since then , i have bought it for most of my girlfriends at their coming of age parties . it 's a good time to be <NUM> , i will tell you that
lincoln rhyme , detective extraordinaire and forensics expert , is hot on the trail of a chinese human smuggler/terrorist nicknamed the ghost . a couple of the illegal immigrants being shipped to the us have escaped , are in hiding , and are being hunted down by the ghost . the combined forces of the nypd , fbi , as well as the ins must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out . jeffery deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of conan doyle 's sherlock holmes . sonny li , an undercover cop from china , is the most outstanding character in the book . since most detective thrillers are generic , it 's good to come across splendid work like this . lincoln rhyme fans obviously will enjoy the stone monkey , but initiates will also be thrilled by it
protection was released in <NUM> . with tricky already having success with his own newly made group portishead , & with their massive hit album dummy just around the corner , there was alot of pressure on massive attack . so on the album they used everything but the girl 's tracy thorn on lead vocals to replace blue line 's female vocalist shara nelson , although she would return for the <NUM> smash hit album mezzanine . the album begins with the lushous protection , the groups sound has definitely changed , as it 's more of a heavy beat than the first album & tracy 's vocals really work here . karma koma is next , this would be a very popular radio hit , and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song . three is quite a dark track , again tracy on vocals here , whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental weather storm continues into the darkness . spying glass is a more of a hip tune , performed by del naja , whilst better things is a smooth sould tune , skillfully performed by tracy . euro child is suprisingly the first rap song since karma koma ( i say suprisingly as blue lines contained alot of rap tunes in it ) tracy 's on vocals again for sly , which returns kinda into the darkness , whilst if sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album heat miser is definitely in the darkness . the album strangely ends with a live rendition of the doors classic light my fire , but done in massive style , it has to be heard to be believed ! ! ! ! protection is definitely different from its predecessor blue lines & whilst i 'd definitely recommend it , i think i would advice people who are new to the group to buy blue lines first as protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first . the band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release mezzanine ! ! !
the libertarian ideology and economic analysis is one of those things that is ruitinely ignored and was scorned in the 1970s and 1980s when economics was hijacked in the west by communists . however libertarians have offered a radical alternative that has rung true from time to time and is an important critique that deserves to have more light shed on it . this is a good beggining . a fun and interesting history that is well written and informative that explains the nature and philosophy of libertarianism and the people behind it . seth j. frantzma
this is a technically meaty book for the medical professional that can overwhelm the layperson . yet the area of autism , asperger 's syndrome and pdd study is in desperate need of the fresh out-of the-box thinking that this book provides . a parent can learn alot skimming over the `` why 's '' and `` what fors '' . for example ; focusing on bold print sub-points instead of trying to follow the fine points of metabolism described in the following paragraphs , will serve you well . this book will give you a good overview of groundbreaking research and treatment . most of all , it will give parents hope that our children may still be capable of functioning better , not just coping with limitations .
to begin with , whatever else one might say about this album , it has to be acknowledged that the import price for this disc , considering that it is only <NUM> minutes long , makes it a somewhat overpriced ep . meanwhile , this somewhat forgotten quasi-gem from alice sits comfortably between the new wave / post-hollywood production of `` flush the fashion '' and his most strongly novelty-influenced album , `` zipper catches skin '' . generally , there 's a stripped down sensibility musically , and less purely goofy lyrics . partly , this is due to the opening `` who do you think we are , '' which presents a rather oblique look , perhaps , at special forces . the music is very stripped down -- no , extremely stripped down compared to `` welcome to my nightmare '' or `` goes to hell '' or all of his later metal albums -- it 's as if alice is getting in touch with his inner garage here . vocally , alice provides his usual range of dark sneers , wide-eyed irony , and generally witty lyrics . certainly a promising start . `` seven & seven is '' ( a cover ) rattles along continuously with a snare drum , with jangly distortion guitars , occasional electronic flourishes , and alice pretty much resorting to straight-up growly voice throughout . hard though not to like an energetic song that declares , `` oom beh beh oom beh beh yea . '' `` prettiest cop on the block , '' as the name suggests is a transvestite policeman tale . definitely shot through with machismo , this is no limp-wristed rendition . `` i got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock . my kids are confused , and my wife is in shock . '' the vocals are the growls as previously -- the i've-been-drinking-and-smoking-too-much gravel kind of voice . the music is a bit uninspired , particularly the drums . the novelty of the song wears out in fairly short order . `` do n't talk old to me '' manages to vary things musically , finally . a fairly deft combination of kind of heavy-handed guitar and lyrics set next to a chorus that features keyboards and a number of layered dialoguing vocal lines . the lyrics , of course , have a certain cleverness as an adult obviously complains about being told to give up all his toys , such as guns and cars . there are more musical details and variation in this song than the previous ones -- the particular combination of comedy and seriousness here is pretty convincing . `` generation landslide ` <NUM> '' is a reprise of the lyrically excellent tune from `` billion dollar babies '' ( the tune , in fact , that gives us the phrase `` billion dollar babies '' ) . a military-march style snare kicks along , as simple guitar chords back up alice 's cultural rant , and adds a verse or two to the original . one of the effects of this song is to point out some of the less inspired aspects of the rest of the disc , but that does n't mean one is n't glad for it being here . energetic , socially incisive alice . `` you want it , you got it '' let 's out alice 's inner used car salesman , as he vocally sleazes his way through this either brilliant send up of the worst of new wave music , or a rather unfortunate example of it . cheesy keyboards and ham-fisted drum machine , many years later this song sounds so dated that it almost ceases to be dated . if this song really tickles your fancy , then `` zipper catches skin '' will be a treasure trove for you as this is definitely a prequel of that album to come . harmless cheese , one may not expect `` cute '' from alice , but here you are . `` you look good in rags '' returns to a more traditional rock ensemble , guitar lead and all . this workaday rocker never really quite stands up , even with the semi-barbershop acapella section of `` rags rag rags '' toward the end , clipping scissors effect and all . the non-stellarness of it does not mean that it 's hopelessly boring . it 's kind of good , harmless fun -- it 's just , one does n't expect this sort of thing from alice . `` you 're a movie '' is a ridiculous cheeky monologue by a would be heroic general type . the music is thoroughly 80s , guitar tone and gacky keyboards all . and , in fact , the chorus that chants , `` you 're a movie '' is completely dead and unspirited . so what makes this pure novelty song ever-fresh , ever-delightful and really very funny are alice 's intercut remarks . they say that in comedy timing is everything , and alice shows that he 's got it in spades here . technically a pretty awful song , one can not help digging the wily wit alice puts out . the last track , `` vicious rumours '' provides that obligatory alice song about public perception . the vocals here draw out the snideness more . one wishes ( throughout the album ) that the drums were set back more in the mix , and the guitars brought forward , but there 's more energy in this particular rocker than most of the rest of the album . so , overall one can hardly recommend this album without qualifications , especially if you are getting here by way of his first band , or by his later work , like `` brutal planet '' . as a kind of essay in cheese , and sheer low-fi production goofiness -- and particularly of a sound that is glued immovably to the 80s -- then you might enjoy this . again , the import price is awfully steep for such a short disc . a used copy seems a better way to go .
the music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to abba music and the story line which was written to showcase the music . i saw the las vegas production , not the the original london production yet the music sung and played in the lv production was just as fantastic as that within the original production . if you like abba , ( and who does not ? ) and can not spring for the price of a ticket , this dvd is the next best thing
i recently saw this guy live even though i was only familiar with `` what if that guy from smashing pumpkins lost his car keys '' . unless you are easily offended , go see him live . you wo n't regret it , he interacts with the audience a lot . i picked up this cd at the merch table after his show . lynch 's combination of acoustic guitar and innocently wicked lyrics will leave you in pain from laughing so hard . i like the fact that this was recorded before a live audience , because it captures the experience of seeing him at a show . that 's what led me to buy this instead of `` a little bit special '' . the audience reaction to the songs on `` superhero '' adds so much to the album . my personal favorites are : dr. stephen - i love the way you expect him to say a certain word , then he says something completely innocent instead . you have to listen to know what i 'm talking about . superhero - this song is a good example of the audience interaction at his shows . i like the audience-chosen superheroes , but i probably ca n't repeat the names here . what if that guy from smashing pumpkins lost his car keys - catchy title for a catchy song . whether you like the smashing pumpkins or not ( i do ) , you will find this short song hilarious . it 's a really great impression of billy corgan . mother 's day - also very short , but such an unexpected ending . taxi driver - oh man , i almost p * ssed myself the first time i heard this song ! it starts out as a folk song until you hear what the taxi driver said . totally politically incorrect , but so funny ! this is my current favorite track . best friends song - this duet with mark teich starts out friendly and quickly becomes a song about how the one friend wants to nail the other friend 's little sister . another one you have to hear to appreciate . i also like the bonus track at the end which contains `` lullaby ( live ) '' and `` special olympics ( live ) '' . lullaby is great , and explains to his daughter `` why mommy left us '' . this album is a good place to start if you like dark offensive humor
just buy it . you will thank me later . one of the most incredible recordings in musical history . anything by lemon jelly is special and lemonjelly.ky is also out of this world so why not buy them both ? if i could give this cd <NUM> stars i would
this is the best fireplace book i have seen . first of all the book has hundreds of beautiful and varied fireplace pictures . the pictures are great because they show the fireplaces in the home , decorated , and with the home furnishings around them . they are all warm and inviting although very different . the text of the book flows well also . first it helps even a novice decorator find the styles that work with your personality and home . then it breaks down fireplace ideas by the different living areas in the house
i ca n't think of a single real jazz musician who has not read this book ... if not they are reading it presently ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it is the ultimate reference guide . when the jazz community lost mr. feather we lost an invaluable friend and supporter of the artform we affectionately refer to as jazz
this is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for christ those who have never heard . it also clearly illustrates the darkness , evil and despair that comes from idolatry . but it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for christ . this book will draw you in from the first page . the world needs more people like stan . people who are willing to trust solely in god and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share christ . this book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think . i highly recommend this book . for all christians , but especially those ( like me ) who have heart for missions . this book details the good , the bad , and the ugly of missions work .
if you 're looking for a true scare , then look no further than this movie . i like movies that give nightmares , and this one is no acception . vincent price is a legend and this movie proves it . this movie has everything , from screams , to all sorts of scares . highly recommended
there are people out there listening to the radio . they want to be rescued . long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la , there are some that would argue that y2k was really the day the music died . ( if not even sooner , but those folks did n't like nirvana , alice in chains or soundgarden . go figure . ) well , anyone who 's heard `` gentlemen '' or `` congregation '' or any other record by the afghan whigs should be yelling `` rescue me , dulli ! '' and on `` powder burns , '' greg 's delivered the goods . possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the whigs ' `` black love , '' the new twilight singers record still should n't be construed as an afghan whigs album without the name . despite dulli wearing lead singer shoes , which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated , tunelessly-endearing sound , the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the whigs . sure , it 's dirty , dirty , grungy blues-rock , but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there . `` bonnie brae '' is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze . piano and violin pepper tracks like `` there 's been an accident , '' while rushing , watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there , most obviously on the intro piece `` toward the waves '' / '' i 'm ready . '' of course to think ahead , people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place . dulli liked smashing beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he 's taken to purloining lyrics , too , reframing the timeless refrain of `` she loves you , yeah , yeah , yeah '' with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din ( `` forty dollars '' ) . not every word on `` powder burns '' is an homage , however . lyrically , dulli has always struck me as a singing charles bukowski . sometimes it 's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you 're too bleary-eyed to read
those who use evolution as proof there is no creator are , in my opinion , narrow minded . evolution only disagrees with written texts of creationism . one needs to look well beyond . if i were god i would want my people to be able to neither prove or disprove my existence ... yet i would leave some doubts or unanswerable questions for man to ponder ... like science that breaks down at the moment of the big bang . those that study the human body have barely glimpsed the complexities of this evolved life form and i find i have a gnawing feeling about how adaptive evolution alone got us all the way here . a bit of doubt leaves that door to god open , albeit not a god exactly like one 's holy book might have posited . many great scientists are believers of sorts so i find atheists to be arrogant , and agnostics perhaps closer to the truth . who knows ... if string theory is in fact reality , perhaps god resides only a dimension away
the frisco kid , directed by robert aldrich , is the quirky inventive saga of a young polish rabbi who is sent to america in <NUM> to take over a congregation in san francisco . getting there proves to be quite a test of his stamina , his adaptability , and his religious faith . gene wilder 's performance as avram is a jaunty , sweet , and convincing triumph of comic bravado . after docking in philadelphia , the rabbi plays good samaritan to three nare-do-wells who later rob him and strand him in a strange land . fortunately he comes upon some amish farmers who give him shelter and money to resume his trek . after a brief stint working on the railroad , avram meets tommy lillard ( harrison ford ) , a bank robber with a heart of gold and a quick temper . the two team up and go ricocheting from one adventure to another -- an escape from a posse , a trial by fire at the hands of some native american indians , a visit to the brotherhood of silent monks , and two violent encounters with the bad boys who robbed avram in philadelphia . gene wilder and harrison ford are one feisty team as rabbi and rescuer in this rough-'n'-ready romp that rivals wilder 's earlier blazing saddles in wild west hilarity . director robert aldrich is a seasoned hand at blending roughhouse and laughter , as fans of his earlier the dirty dozen and the longest yard will attest . with a full posse of screen talents , the frisco kid rides tall in the comedy saddle . movie critics of the era panned the movie saying : `` the pairing of gene wilder and a young harrison ford may sound intriguing , but this film is not . it 's a startlingly unfunny comedy in which most of the jokes misfire and the evolution of the characters is forced and unbelievable . wilder is a great comedic talent , but salvaging this material is beyond him . '' evidently they were n't looking for a good time . talk of plot character 'evolution ' should be worried about in film making classrooms . i think they should have actaully sat back and just enjoyed the romp . the frisco kid is an offbeat comedy that manages to convey the sturdy faith of a believer . avram will not travel on the sabbath for any reason ; he returns his share of the money from lillard 's bank robbery ; he transmits the joy of judaism to the indians ; and he agonizes over murdering a man in self-defense . whereas this movie will probably not become a smash with the public , it is highly regarded for the religiously sensitive .
this book is such a blessing to me . i 'm only up to day <NUM> ( their are <NUM> days worth of devotions and prayers ) and i have n't over-eaten once . god is using this book to bless me . please buy it , read it , and let god use it in your life . giving god your eating habits and your size will be the best thing you can do for yourself . this book is worth getting . please buy it and find out for yourself how much it can help you . it 's helping me . it 's more than helping me , it 's giving me victory
frederic chopin is a very talented artist and composer . a must have of any chopin collector
in her autobiographical novel , i know why the caged bird sings , maya angelou recounts her life story as a young , keenly intelligent but insecure black girl in the south during the 1930s and california during the 1940s . the book conveys the difficulties associated with the mixture of racial and gender discrimination endured by a southern black girl , though , and this is perhaps the most fundamental theme explored in her autobiography . the intersectionality of race and gender is a pivotal thread of angelou 's theme , where more than one type of subjugation results in a multiple burden for the victim . overall , i know why the caged bird sings is a powerful , stirring account of the intersectionality of race and gender regarding black women . though segregation had been officially declared null and void , many of the southern states were steeped in racist tendencies that further multiplied the gender inequality that exposed black women to a multi-faceted oppression . peiss , hine , terborg-penn , bederman , et . al . all examine threads of this intersectionality , and in discussing these threads , one can draw a distinct comparison between anti-black , anti-black women sentiment and angelou 's personal experiences . as a girl , angelou believed her gender to be a limiting factor . she considered herself to be unheroic , and incapable of achieving spectacular feats like the boys in her comic books . in the narrative , being female for angelou is just as trying as being black , and she struggled with the double burden , rather than embracing it . however , as more and more black women slowly overcame their troubles as a result of the overwhelming intersectionality of the time , so did angelou . the novel ended with hope because she bucks the stereotype to become the first black female streetcar conductor . angelou 's spike in confidence and belief in her ability reflects the gradual evolution of black women 's race and gender after decades of imprisonment , and foreshadows a future of activism , struggle for respect and eventual victory in those regards .
the book covered the period of history just at the turn of the 20th century . i found it to be very informative and made me feel like i was right there strolling the streets with ted roosevelt . although the book is strong in its era coverage more attention should have been given to the various laws and acts that were in place at the time preventing & quot ; police & quot ; to perform their respective functions
chely wright is that rare artist whose voice conveys more than just melody , there 's raw emotion behind the words , and a range of emotion that runs the entire gamut from ecstasy to mournful sorrow . that she earned her first number one single with the title track from this album was both blessing and curse . `` single white female '' was pure country pop , upbeat and quirky , a unique initial offering on an album that grows progressively more complex and introspective with each subsequent song . that mca followed `` single white female '' by releasing the lyrically strong but folksy , down-tempo `` she went out for cigarettes '' is almost inexplicable ; the two songs are such polar-opposites that their back-to-back pairing on the album is somewhat jarring . there are so many solid songs on this album that it 's hard to say what could have happened had the follow-up been one of her more high-energy tracks or one of her more soul-searching ballads . thematically , single white female is an album about every facet of love , from the awkward beginning stages to the tearful end . the album 's true center comes not from the title track , but from the third single released , `` it was '' . for those attracted to the album by the title track , `` the fire '' comes closest to matching its energy and tone , followed by the radio-friendly `` some kind of somethin ' '' . together with `` single white female '' , this trio of peppy songs anchor and invigorate an overall somber ten-track album . perhaps the strongest track on the album is the fourth , `` unknown '' , a slow ballad with a wailing steel guitar accompaniment whose lyrics touch the great fears so many of us share of ending our days alone ; chely 's smoky voice has never conveyed more collective pathos . there 's also an updated version of her <NUM> single , `` the love that we lost '' -- which , vocally , is so much stronger than the radio release from her second album that the two songs sound vastly different despite nearly identical musical arrangements . then there 's `` picket fences '' , a song laced with tangible irony , regret , and even denial -- a trifecta that paint a vivid but sad story of a career-driven persona . the album ends with the cute but bittersweet `` rubbin ' it in '' , a song about all those little haunting reminders that come after a relationship ends , and the desperate pining of `` why do i still want you '' . both lyrically and vocally , this is an album that strives to make a connection with the listener . for those so attuned , single white female is a too-often overlooked emotional journey that 's solid and rewarding , a milestone record in a career that deserves so much more attention from an artist who has never gotten the attention she truly deserves . closing in on a decade since the album 's release , the sound and the soul are still as fresh today as they were when single white female first hit store shelves , longevity that 's rare in an age of throw-away music from a seemingly endless parade of different but identical pre-fab singers
this bible is really great because of the little boxes that explain hard to understand things in the text , and also because it 's niv ( new international version ) so its in plain simple to understand english . if you go to a chistian school and need a good bible for class you should get this it explains everything so well only jesus himself could have said it bette
when this movie showed up on a movie channel , i almost skipped it , but i am so glad that i did n't ! i enjoyed the characters so much , including the insane little seeing eye b * tch ! there were so many feelings involved . the film was funny , a little crazy , touching , sad , and very , very moving . i loved getting to know the russian or ukrainian people and their culture ; the old as well as the new . alex is so charming and funny at the same time , with his ideas of hip hop and the american culture ; and wisdom that seems beyond his years . elijah wood was wonderful as the eccentric little american jew named jonathan who seemed very meek and a little bumbling ( he had a phobia of dogs and almost could n't get into the car with one ) , but he was amazingly brave to go on his quest in a country he knew nothing about to find the woman who helped his grandfather escape from the nazis in wwii . alex 's grandfather , who insisted that he was blind , yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in , was such a character ; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he 'd had in his life , and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while . the russian songs throughout the movie were perfect and pulled you right into the story . the scenery was amazing . it all made me want to visit ukraine . if you have n't watched this movie , do it !
mrs. piggle wiggle was 'the nanny'/'dr.phil ' of her time . these stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming . i enjoyed reading this book as a child and could n't resist purchasing it for my girls <NUM> and <NUM> to enjoy . we have been working our way through various childrens ' novels as part of our bedtime ritual . books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension . these stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running . some of the material may seem dated , but it 's definetely a classic .
i have always loved paul gallico as a writer , and this short story is one of my favorites of his work . it is a beautiful story that children may like , but adults will love . the story is about a lonely artist , philip rhyader , who retreats from society due to a hunchback and deformed hand . he lives in a lighthouse where he creates his works of art and tends to injured animals . one day a young girl named frith brings him a snow goose that has been injured . ( i loved the book so much that i named my oldest daughter fritha . ) although she is at first scared of rhyader , a friendship develops between them as they tend the goose . after the goose is healed , it flies away but returns every year to stay with rhyader for the season . the girl , frith , returns each year when the snow goose returns . rhyader falls in love with her but she does not realize it . the book ends with the battle of dunkirk when the british troops are trapped on the beach . rhyader , who was unable to fight in the war because of his deformities , takes his small sailboat and crosses the channel several times , delivering the british soldiers to safety . on each trip he is accompanied by the beautiful snow goose . i 'll give you fair warning , the ending of the book is one of the saddest you will ever read . however , the message of love and friendship and hope conveyed in the book will make you want to return and read it over and over again .
i saw the last half hour of this movie on the bravo network last week when i was actually looking for a rerun of `` project runway , '' so my first exposure to it was the segment with k-mart and the interview with charlton heston . wow . i ended up being grateful `` project runway '' was n't on . i made sure to catch `` bowling for columbine '' when bravo ran it again , so i could see the whole thing . they showed it again last night . i have to say here that , prior to this , i 'd never seen anything of michael moore 's ( except for one episode of `` tv nation '' ) and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things i 'd heard , including things moore fans had raved about that i thought were negative , such as the way moore confronts people in his films . what surprised me about `` bowling for columbine '' was what came across to me as michael moore 's compassion . i really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances . i have much greater respect for him than i had before i saw the film . his motivating factor does n't seem to me to be so much political as moral . he truly is a moralist . he reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way . ( who an awful lot of people found annoying , if i need remind anyone . ) for him , i do n't think it 's so much `` corporations and other powerful entities are evil '' as `` people not caring about other people -- especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate -- results in separation and hostility between people , which leads to evil . '' well , shoot , they preach that in my church every sunday . and , last time i checked , we were n't socialists . also : i had heard , even from moore fans , that his interview with charlton heston was unfortunate and embarrasing . but i do n't agree . why should n't he have asked heston why he did what he did ? why on earth would heston have gone to denver and flint after what happened ? i just do n't understand it . some people said heston was obviously suffering from alzheimer 's and incapable of carrying on the interview . he seemed entirely lucid to me . he was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he did n't want to answer the questions . thank you , michael moore , for leaving kayla rolland 's photo behind . maybe charlton heston took it inside . maybe it made some kind of difference . peac
when your drowning in the world of trendy , here today , gone tomorrow rappers ... murs is a breath of fresh air . i like every track on this album , as well as 3:16 . usually i pick up an album , like a few tracks , and listen to the dope tracks and that 's it . i wish it were a little longer , or contained a few more tracks . still a dope album though
i really loved the book i just wish the author of the book would of used kyles origin from the comics
when i watch this movie it 's as if the writer in <NUM> had a pre-cognizance of what was going to happen in <NUM> . pay particular attention to the last scene between redford and robertson . the words robertson says are more relevant today that they were then . besides meaning and relevance it 's also a great action thriller , with a little romance . faye dunaway is at her most beautiful and redford his most attractive . they both give truly amazing performances as ordinary people accidently caught up in monumental intrigues they know nothing of .
i love this book ! early teens and older should read this book . learn what it means to love and to sacrifice .
without a doubt this is mark 's most complete movie to date . the intricate plot , stylish flashbacks , and unique camera angels , makes this more than your average straight to video . tibor tackas shows a very good touch . the ending begs for a sequel , and i would pay money to see it in the theater if one were to be made . this is the type of movie that mark is able to show the moves that have made him the envy of the action genre actors , and object of desire from female fans , but he is also is allowed to actually act and show depth . tibor tackus should be thanked for giving us more mark than i have seen in his previous movies to date , except for & quot ; only the strong & quot ; , which i like equally as well as this
i finally found a book to recommend to people of my era who `` induldged '' once upon a time and now have kids of their own . responsible drug use can be no more traumatic than wine at dinner or the daily dose of caffine . it is n't about the drug it is about the way it is used and under what circumstances . teach children the facts and show them responsible conduct and they are likely to respond accordingly . however , sullum did not write this book to condone the use of drugs . he wrote a book that instead argues to the logical conclusion that humans have always used drugs and they are likely to keep right on doing so . this book takes the wind out of the argument that drug use is somehow morally wrong . in fact he is pretty convincing when he claims that drug use is normal and to adopt a `` zero tolerance '' position towards drugs is impossible to do without creating high crime and coruption as a side effect . it is morally wrong to attempt to regulate moral behavior in a free society . it is acknowledged in the writing that `` some '' people have trouble with drugs but the majority of users do not . spending hugh amounts of public money to stop drug use in a free society does not make any sense but sullum makes it clear to the reader that making sense has never been the point in the war on drugs . this really rung a bell with me because it appeals to my common sense and personal experience.my use of drugs in my younger days did not stop me from being honorably discharged from the military , getting a college degree or becomming a professional technician . i find that i am one of the many middle aged people who smoked some pot and still became reponsible adults . i also stopped , including cigarettes , when it no longer suited me . just as sullum points out that the overwhelming majority of us do . so ... i would highly recommend this book to you if you are questioning the rationality behind the war on drugs . it is not going to convince you that you should be doing drugs and that is not the pont of the work . this study will give you many well argued points that demonstrate how the effort to stop drug use through draconian drug laws is not working and worse , doing more damage to society overall than the drugs themselves are causing . an example of this is tobacco . the author wrote a grate deal on this point . this is one of the most widely used and harmful of all the drugs in our society . through education and a publily funded add campain the used of tobacco has dropped dramatically over the past <NUM> years without draconian enforcement . just the opposite has happened with marijuanna where the laws are becomming more and more draconian every year , the cost of enforcement is mind boggling and the easiest place to score a bag of pot is right down at the local high school . it is a strange , sad situation to tolerate .
i read the true story of the my lia massacre when it first came out , and then knew why when we came back we were called baby killers . now that i have read this book on my lia i wonder how they let something like that happen and what makes me mad is that nothing more has been done about the people that done it all . i personelly think that all the people that took part should be put in jail and left there , but other then that it was an excellent book to read
this book scrapes greatness in its harrowing portrayal of obsessive love . why is n't it a masterpiece ? because it does n't so much end as just ... stops . still , a must read
a wonderful book for teaching a coping strategy to a child with an autism spectrum disorder when s/he feels overwhelmed , stressed or angry .
i was n't sure about this when i ordered it , but it was a hit ! its a new favorite , and everyone who hears it , raves . beautiful stage , great music
the third edition contains material about high gain observers and sliding modes which are welcome additions . the book also contains sections about backstepping and passivity techniques . as in the first edition the author 's writing is clear and concise . it is a good complement to vidyasagar 's nonlinear systems book .
almost a carbon copy of it 's predecessor , 'vital signs ' . unlike 'vital signs ' , which was virtually flawless , this one has some flaws . this follow-up has less memorable songs , cheesier lyrics , and drags a little bit more . still , a good overall effort nonetheless . the highlight is obviously 'is this love ' , which reached as high as # <NUM> on the bilboard charts . overall , same mid-80 's power-ballad formula as 'vital signs ' , which is never a bad thing , is it
i have been reading some of the reviews online for this cd and i am wondering for the p-funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect ? i like this double cd because george was going for the old & new sound of today 's overproduced and water down sound.the songs i really liked were `` bounce <NUM> this '' a funk jam for the ages , '' inhale slow '' , '' never ending love '' , '' su , su , su '' , '' something stank '' , '' viagra '' , '' paradigm '' , '' gyspy woman '' , '' whole lotta shakin '' , and `` goodnight sweetheart , goodnight '' .there were some songs i did n't care for songs like `` i can dance '' which went on for too long and `` butt-a-butt '' .i wish mr. clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this cd : sir nose , starchild , dr.funkenstein , the monkey , the horny horns , etc.in short , this is a very good album better than the pervious p-funk albums in the 90's.this cd is a good start
i ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself , and i was n't disapointed . the new print of `` the searchers '' with all the extras ( lobby cards , reprint of the dell comic , and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set -- in addition you get a two dvd set for stagecoach ( which started the ford/wayne partnership ) , fort apache , she wore a yellow ribbon,3 godfaters , they were expendable , wings of eagles , and the long voyage home . the only thing i would have chaged is that i would have made almost all the movies in this set westerns ( the searchers , stagecoach , fort apache , she wore a yellow ribbon , rio grande,3 godfathers , the man who shot liberty valance , and the quiet man ( which is n't a western , but i think it fits in well ) would have been my choice for the set . that aside i think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of john ford ( or john wayne ) will not be disappointed .

my 4.5 year old knew his numbers , but when i saw the inside of this book on amazon , i realized that i have not used any technique to build his basics in counting etc. , and bought this book numbers 1-30 starts with simple curve excercises that allow the child to 1. learn drawing curves 2. reading and writing numbers 3. introduces children [ and parents ] to focus on the stroke and the right way to write the numbers . <NUM> . counting as groups and allows build up pattern recognition skills my son who was used to counting with his finger , now can count in groups by looking at a group of dots . thanks kumon .. i just purchased the next book .. counting <NUM> to <NUM>
out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and affirmation for her existence , my soul to his spirit is born . melda beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young girl she has worth , beauty and unlimited potential . for a male love that is disconnected from possession , obsession or penetration ; love that only a father can give . never knowing that magnitude of love , she harbored ill feelings for her father . traumatized since she was a little girl , her nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a legitimate voice , and truly forgave her father . since her atonement , ms. beaty has been blessed to meet and share stories with other black women with similar histories of overwhelming father-daughter relationships . relationships that more often than not , define how we relate to the men in our lives . my soul to his spirt speaks of the totality of our lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with our fathers . my soul to his spirit does not bash fathers , however , it does present a penetrating view from every possible angle . the six powerful chapters , loving : daddy 's girl ; distant : every once in awhile ; abandon : one day he was gone ; non-existent : could pass me on the street ; amended : time and forgiveness heals all wounds ; and deceased : gone too soon , cover the gamut of emotions daughters have felt for fathers . i applaud ms. beaty and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing and strengthening for the family unit . i venture to say each reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings . this is a humbling read ; an epiphany . reviewed by ann of the rawsistaz¬ô reviewers
this has <NUM> stone cold rock classics on it - hotel california , new kid in town , life in the fast lane and victim of love . for these songs alone the album deserves <NUM> stars . the rest i can pretty much do without . i 'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by don henley , such as wasted time and the last resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs . the guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on h.c. even after all this time . felder and walsh sound great together . i hear they 're recording a new album for release late this year and it 's a shame that felder is no longer in the band . anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed , if not by the band then definitely by us listeners
after waiting over a year to see this book , it is very strange to see amazon.com make lois dubin the author of this book . dubin wrote a forward to the book . dubin is not the author of this book . the author is valerie hector . the book is simply wonderful
with the ever changing computers , this book is valuable in learning what is expected as a computer technician
this is my favourite ella record of the moment . check out & quot ; solitude & quot ; , the guitar player is wonderful and is an excellent listen in itself . bravo to you wherever you may be
menace ii society is one of those films that leaves a powerful message that is not forgotten long after you have seen it . the story focuses on a teenage street thug who is caught in the middle of gang life and drugs but does n't know how to escape it . after getting carjacked while cruising with his cousin on the streets of south central la , the main character swears revenge on the gangsters who killed his cousin . this movie is very violent and has a lot of language , but it should be shown to every teenager entering high school to show them what can happen if they decide to hook up with the wrong people and make the wrong choices in life . although i did not like the ending very much , the impact of the film was very powerful and left quite an impact . it showed me that if you mess with the wrong people and do n't take responsibility for your actions , you will get dealt with and quite possibly , killed . the main character gets murdered because he sleeps with some chick and gets her pregnant . she tells him , and he 's like `` what the heck are you telling me for ? i had the plastic on extra tight . '' condoms are not foolproof . they can slip and they can break . if you are gon na be with a woman for one night , make sure she is on something else , or pull out . the digital transfer to the dvd is first rate . the audio is outstanding in both the <NUM> channel dolby surround format as well as the 5.1 channel digital tracks . highs and lows are both top notch ... be sure to warn your neighbors if you have thin walls . i had sound complaints after i played this movie on my system ! the bass from the subwoofer as well as the gunshots during the whole movie is so loud , you feel as if it is happening right in front of you . amazing ..
my first zydeco experience took place a few years ago when queen ida visited the twin cities . i made my first trip to new orleans this spring and purchased putumayo presents : zydeco at a local music store . the real thing does n't come around here often enough , but i certainly can & quot ; cha cha cha & quot ; in my living room with this cd
this is one of the best adventure films i have ever seen . wonderous , full of humor and action . great performances of sean connery and michael caine . and all that before the golden age of special ( computer generated ) effects . a masterpiece which i never tire of seeing . and every time the ending makes me feel a bit sad and feeling sorry for daniel and peachy . they deserve better .
'the dog of the south ' is a perfect novel . this sounds like hyperbole . it is short ; there is very little in the way of plot ; the characters do not develop in any way : yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything i have ever read . before embarking on my second reading ( just a fortnight after i finished my first ) i planned to write down my favourite lines from the book . i gave up because i was transcribing almost the entire novel . no synopsis can do it justice . ray blount , jr. has said of this book that 'no-one should die without reading it . ' i 'm with him all the way
i thoroughly enjoyed seasons <NUM> , <NUM> and <NUM> of the house of eliott . the acting was fantastic , the dresses magnificent and the locations , as with most english mini-series , marvelous . my only complaint is that it does n't end ! ! there is no closure to this . as you approach the last chapter of season <NUM> you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left , and - oh surprise ! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone ! is there any chance that there is a season <NUM> out there somewhere ? ? ? ?
i am a second grade teacher and always looking for creative ways to supplement my lesson plans on the planets . children do n't easily identify with planets , since they are spheres that can not be seen in their daily lives . children usually respond to the colors , but never really connect with them . now , with `` my fantastic field trip to the planets '' the planets all have faces , personalities , and the undivided attention of my class . the show transforms the planets into memorable characters . it really has helped my students to remember not only the names of the planets , but also detailed facts about them . i have recommended this dvd to our school district , for i feel that it should be part of the regular curriculum . the dvd is so wonderful that it can be enjoyed outside the classroom as well and give children a real head-start on learning the planets and developing a passion for astronomy .
before you start this book you should know that any resemblance between the book and the movies that hollywood has turned out is completely accidental . the names of the main characters are about the only similarity that i could find and as is the norm , the book was much better . this , the last installment in the musketeer series , gives us the story of the final acts of our heroes , athos , porthos , aramis and d'artagnan . unlike many literary characters our musketeer friends have aged as the story progresses and have all retired but d'artagnan who is still the captain of the king 's musketeers . athos and porthos are quite wealthy and aramis has attained the rank of bishop . aramis is not content with his station however and knows a secret that he thinks he can use to become pope . this secret is the knowledge that louis xiv has a twin brother who is hidden away in the bastille and aramis is quite sure that this brother would make a better king than the current monarch . aramis is also pretty sure that the new king in gratitude will nominate his liberator for the office of cardinal and then will scheme to make the new cardinal pope . in this plot aramis acts alone except for some help from porthos who has no idea what he is involved in . the twins are successfully switched for a short while but then the plot falls apart and aramis and porthos flee for their lives although porthos is still not sure what is going on . the `` pretender '' to the throne is left to his own devices by aramis and is imprisoned in a new location with the iron mask added to his discomfiture . aramis does not come across in this book as much of a hero and in many respects this story is much darker than it 's predecessors . given the advanced age of the musketeers , there are not nearly as many swashbuckling adventures as one is accustomed to but on occasion porthos in particular will rise to the challenge . the political intrigues of the court of louis xiv and the decline of the musketeers are in fact the main plot lines of this story . in the end , only one of the four is left and to find out which one you will just have to read the book . athos , by the way , only seems to play a side role in this story and is neither involved in the plot against the king or in his rescue . as is always the case , dumas ' writing style is superb and is filled with historical fact . he does tend to be a bit wordy and his books are often much longer than necessary but even with this slight drawback he ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors . in this book dumas closes out the careers of his most popular characters and he does it with style
i had to give this one <NUM> stars just because it is so fun . it is deeply flawed at points and as deep as a puddle , yet it is funny and still has some moving moments . the nostalgia factor works as well if you were out and about at the time . affleck comes across a big dope , but that 's okay ( cuz i think he is ) . ricci is great - why is she so underutilized ? that girl has a power in her . rudd is the sweet sort of everyman good guy and it suits him well . love is , well , actually ... good here . i liked her and i felt for her character . hudson is very , very funny , particularly in her scenes with jay mohr - they have great chemistry . garoffalo is the best in a tart-tounged smaller part . definitely worth a spin for an easy-on-the-eyes comedy . best line , garoffalo in a moving cab trying to light a cigarette : these matches are disappointing me !
david lanz has really turned me into a new age music listener and admirer with his graceful and soaring piano pieces . i 've never heard piano before that sounds like a living and breathing habitat , and since i 've been playing it myself from the age of six i had an even greater appreciation for his art . as a composer he is a genius but he 's just as brilliant as a performer . i can hear dark night sky and trees swaying in the wind , a bobbing brook running through a cool fir forest , a big cold orb of the silver moon shining on a grassy field and more through this music . nightfall is truly incredible and unforgettable and hearing it for the first time when i was around eleven , burned itself into my mind and i swear it has never left . i grew up listening to new age music and david lanz , michael jones , spencer brewer , nancy rumbel and eric tingstad just to name a few as their sweet melodies on piano , guitar flutes and other instruments wove a tapestry of sound and color like no other . this album might be short , but each piece brings quality that no quantity can beat and that makes it better than <NUM> cd sets of new age or any other music that i got in the past , filled with pieces but not all of them are to my taste . this album is sweet , dreamy , in places majestic and romantic and above all its filled with gorgeous melodies that make sense , and each one is a gem in my eyes . this has been in my collection for about thirteen years and i love it no matter much time passes between listening . i swear that listening to this really relaxes me , and right now as im typing , listening to it at work , i forget that im in a concrete jungle , and instead i feel like im sitting in a lighthouse with a fireplace burning ( no physically possible i know but still , its cute ) and i feel cozy and happy
i love gwyneth paltrow in general , but especially when she blows us away with her perfect english accent . the plot was interesting , with mystery , drama , suspense and of course romance . i totally recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good love story
ron mann is a canadian filmmaker who specializes in documentaries about alternative culture ; be it comic books with comic book confidential , a famous dance craze with twist or marijuana culture with grass . his latest film , tales of the rat fink , playfully profiles ed `` big daddy '' roth who helped popularize the customization of cars in the 1950s . roth saw automobiles as much more than just modes of transportation but rather blank canvasses just waiting to be adorned with his stylish artwork or to be rebuilt from the ground up in his own unique way . mann does a fantastic job of taking us back to the ` 50s with period music and plenty of archival footage . however , his documentary is far from traditional as he has roth narrate his own life but voiced by actor john goodman . mann also gives several classic cars their own voice as they tell their own story and how they contributed to hot rod car culture . it 's an unusual move that takes a little getting used to but for those who have seen mann 's other documentaries it is merely a natural progression of his idiosyncratic style - kind of like roth himself . mann animates still photographs and instead of having someone drone on about the different kinds of paint jobs , shows it through stylized animation techniques and footage of cars being customized . throughout it all , he has roth 's most famous creation , rat fink ( his answer to mickey mouse - a bright green mutant rat - whom he had grown tired of and created a symbol of everything that was cool and dangerous about the hot rod culture ) , bridges each segment via animated interludes and accompanied by the surf music of the sadies . tales of the rat fink does an excellent job immersing us in the custom car culture , how it came to be and its distinctive characteristics . this documentary takes a nostalgic look back at a time when cars had their own distinctive look ; they were works of art - something that is missing today in our current homogenous culture . its unorthodox approach may put off some but it does mirror the gonzo the look of roth 's artwork and takes it away from the stuffy confines of traditional documentaries . `` big daddy lives ! '' is a rare , archival interview with roth who talks about how he designs cars and the criteria he used to do this . this extra provides fascinating insight into the man and his work . `` ratfink reunion . '' to celebrate the 20th anniversary of rat fink , roth and von dutch did a customized paint job on a car together . it 's great to see these two artists doing what they do best . `` big daddy 's garage '' features galleries of his rough sketches for t-shirt designs , stills from the <NUM> detroit autorama that featured a collection of many of roth 's classic cars , samples from the rat fink comic strip , and other artists ' interpretation of rat fink . `` interview with director ron mann . '' a friend turned him onto roth 's work in the 1990s and in <NUM> he decided to make a film about the man but when he died suddenly in <NUM> mann shelved the project . a few years later , he got the idea to tell roth 's story from the point-of-view of his cars . `` deleted scene '' is a brief clip that shows the rat fink merchandise explosion with model kits , t-shirts , hats , etc . also included is the theatrical trailer . finally , there is a music video for the sadies who provided the music for the documentary . it 's animated and features rat fink with members of the band
who does n't like doris day ? she 's perky and cute and you ca n't keep from smiling when you watch her movies . we enjoy this collection , although some of the shows are better than others . a great keepsake for fans
i purchased an hd-dvd player with this title in mind and it doesnt disappoint . this is by far one of the very best hd-dvd 's on the market to date and even tho the brand is somewhat new , that is still saying something as there are a bunch of beautiful releases already . this is without a doubt a reference quality disc both in terms of the picture , audio and in terms of extras and what the hd format can do that regular dvd 's cant . first the picture and what a picture it is . it is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail . the amount of grain is perfect with no noticable noise & no edge enhancment was visable throught the entire film . the skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate . one of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black . black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows . the scene where he is spraypainting his batsuit with the black spraypaint has to be seen to be believed . i dont think i have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful . there isnt a single thing i would change with the picture . my hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer , its one of the best i have ever seen . as for the audio , the dolby digital plus track is amazing but the truehd track is where this baby really takes off . if you own the toshiba a1 you need to update to the 2.0 firmware udate to be able to use the trehd and its everybit worth updating . the batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general , very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should . on the truehd track it sounded simply stunning . dialogue was easily heard without sacrificing any of the other sounds and effects . overall its the best truehd track so far and that again is saying something as training day had an awsome truehd track , it just couldnt beat out the power this soundtrack had . as for the extras , were presented with all of the extras from the <NUM> disc special edition plus the hd-dvd exclusive ime track ( in-movie experience ) . there were some people who complained that this ime track wasnt as good as some of the others because some of the pauses between speakers were fairly long . i have to <NUM> % disagree with this . when people on the ime track are speaking non stop and the ime track runs non stop you are never really given a chance to get into the movie as all of your attention is focused on the ime screen . with batman begins they made it so the ime track was active during the less important and less exciting scenes and inactive during the exciting and important scenes . what this did was allow you to actually get involved with the movie while at the same time get information from the ime track during the more boring and less important parts of the movie . they absolutly did this on purpose and you can tell alot of thought went into when the ime should be active and when it shouldnt . in the end it was unlike anything i have ever experinced before with a commentary track and when the movie was over i had felt like i had not only just seen the ime track but i had also watched the movie . it was awsome and really has me sold on ime . i thought that ime might be kind of gimmicky when ifirst got into hd-dvd but it couldnt be farther from the truth . ime is the future of commentary tracks and there really is no comparison between ime and the old style of commentary . so to sum this up , batmen begins is a must buy if you own a hd-dvd player . its one of the best super hero movies ever made and this hd-dvd transfer is the best it has ever looked . put a big dose of amazing sound and a big dose of ime on top of that and you have what is arguably the best release so far for hd-dvd . its releases like this that make me happy i got into hd-dvd right off the bat without worrying about the damned format war . as long as hd-dvd keeps performing at this level , i will be an hd-dvd supporter till the end . orangecrus
short enought to watch it , learn the key points . you will need the book however , to see more examples and better understanding . perfect complementary to the book ( without book not as useful )
i teach short-story writing , and i 've had my students read this book because it shows that there is still a way to & quot ; make it new & quot ; in the story form . arvin 's stories , all of them , have nice surprises in form or content . he is not satisfied with cliches or overused word or character packages . his historical pieces do n't smack of research , but present a complex world with compelling characters . the stories are not of interest to solely writers ; they 're compelling to anyone who cares about the human heart . i look forward to reading his novel , articles of war , which i 've heard is coming out from doubleday in january <NUM>
rarely has a film drawn me in so deeply that i remain affected days after i viewed it . `` the son 's room '' is profound in its ability to create its moods especially in the latter half of the film . i feel that the director 's presentation of this happy family , in the film 's first half , is what allowed me to feel the result of an impending tragedy so personally . i kept thinking that i wanted everything to go back to the way it was before . i shared their grief as if it was my own . i also applaud the presentation of an italian society which is unlike the comic opera italian experience presented in american films over the past decades going back to the silent era . the film may not affect you as deeply as it affected me , but i highly recommend the absorbing story that is presented .
i just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary . i got through <NUM> years of college latin with it , and almost never failed to find the word i was looking for . i particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface , to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you 're looking for . its only downfall is that , as a paperback , it begins to get a bit well-thumbed , leading the serious latinist to think , a little wistfully , that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition . but for a mere six bucks , you can easily afford to buy a replacement . personally , i own two
to anyone who attended a british public school this is a must view ! to any one else who has a sense of humour or who likes to keep their lives organized it is also unparalleled . the scene where cleese plays a monk chasing a young lady along a country lane says it all . headmasters ... this one 's for you
the episodes always began in the same fashion : on a stormy night , a disembodied voice welcomes us to an obviously haunted yet strangely colorful castle called horrible hall . a vampire bat flies across a full moon and attempts to enter a window , which inexplicably moves , causing the bat to crash into the stone wall , revert to vampire form , and fall to the ground . the vampire looks at the viewer and gripes , `` this place is driving me batty ! '' the vampire , of course , was count drac , one of the hosts of filmation 's groovie goolies , a <NUM> 's favorite which is the latest new release under bci 's ink & paint brand . this cartoon , a spin-off of the then-popular the archie show and originally paired with the adventures of sabrina the teenage witch , is a long-awaited release that has finally come to dvd in a package featuring the complete series on <NUM> discs . an exponent of the classic universal monsters craze that began in the <NUM> 's ( and was still going strong in the '70 's ) , groovie goolies was a gang of friendly , rock-and-roll-playing monsters whose adventures acted as a sort of monsterized kids ' version of rowan and martin 's laugh-in , following almost the same format right down to the wall of windows ( here christened `` weird window time '' ) where the characters told jokes and one-liners . in addition to drac , the other goolies were frankie ( the friendly , sweetly goofy frankenstein 's monster ) , wolfie ( a hip , surfing , hot-rod-driving , practical-joking werewolf ) , mummy , boneapart ( a skeleton who fell apart as often as not ) , the sexy vampira-inspired bella laghostley , wacky witch-cook hagatha , and a host of others . sabrina makes appearances as well , along with some of the other characters from her show ( which deserves its own release as a companion to this set , as the goolies originated on sabrina ) . the pacing of each episode is frenetic , which helps with some of the humor ; many of the jokes are enormously corny , but the delivery and speed with which they are told makes them funny , and the character voices are top-notch talent , featuring howard morris and larry storch doing most of the characters . each episode also featured fun , cute and funky soft-rock songs that were usually somehow related to the show ( two per episode ) , and the goolies actually scored a top ten hit during the '70 's with `` chick-a-boom , '' which is also here . the episodes have been well restored , with vibrant color , and the artwork , which filmation has usually excelled at , really stands out . extras include commentary for two episodes , featuring lou schemier ( head of filmation during its run ) , historian darrel mcneil , monster expert bob burns and goolies head writer jack mendelsohn , hosted by voice-over artist wally wingert . wingert also appears as one of the stars of a `` docu-comedy '' called goolians , which combines documentary material with a sitcom format . in this feature ( which runs almost like a goolies episode ) wingert and fellow goolian daniel roebuck ( of lost ) , both self-confessed monster freaks , are sent on a mission to gather information about the groovie goolies to cure their classic monster fixation . from my point of view , there is n't anything wrong with a classic monster fixation , but along the way we hear from mendelsohn , schemier , alice cooper ( who originated the monsters/rock music connection ) , ron chaney ( grandson of lon jr. ) , forrest j. ackerman ( ex-famous monsters of filmland publisher ) and more , so maybe it 's a good thing . if you 're looking for a way to introduce your kids to the idea that sometimes scary can be fun , grab this set ; it 's a great halloween treat and a wonderful return visit from some old fiends . to quote frankie , `` we needed that !
the conflicting reviews on this one made me stop and think , but i decided to purchase it anyway , and i am glad that i did . for those who are puzzled or disappointed by the absence of gibson guitars , marshall amps , etc. , i would recommend that they watch the interview segments on disc <NUM> , in which bruce explains that they had originally tried the gibson/marshall setup , but that it simply did not work . it would be well to consider that cream had not played together for <NUM> years , so that it was rather like forming a new band ; however , this set affirms that all the elements are still in place , and the band delivers solid performances throughout . there are some persons who contend that baker and bruce were broke and desperate , and somehow convinced clapton to play with them to bail them out . however , in the interview segments , both clapton and baker confirm that it was clapton 's idea , with baker stating that he `` was n't very keen on doing it '' initially , until clapton coaxed him into it . bruce looks terribly frail , and is seated during some parts of the show ; however , his bass and vocal work are superb . clapton , who has aged well , shows that he has lost none of the fire and flair of the old days , and the 68-year-old baker displays a level of skill and stamina rarely seen in drummers half his age . while it is true that these performances are somewhat different from the originals , the updated renditions are amazingly good ; after all , improvisation was always one of the factors which set cream apart from other bands . in an era when phony , hybrid versions of 60's-era bands seem to be everywhere , it is refreshing to see all the original members of one of the most influential bands of all time put aside their differences , re-form , and deliver quality performances of some of the greatest songs ever written . having viewed this set several times since buying it , i feel that it would have been a bargain at twice the price . thanks and kudos to ginger , jack , and eric - long live the cream
bought this cd for my wife who is a big fan of traditional irish music . i love the beautiful voices . the voice & instruments mix are very clear ; one is not over powering the other
christian slater 's character reminds me of a young jack nicholson , who replaces his brother on the police force after he is murdered . i was surprised that he did n't become as popular as tom cruise after this film was released in <NUM> , but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career . i think he 's a better actor than most people realize , with much more talent than making below average movies like `` broken arrow '' .
this book is a brilliant recreation of the personality of a conflicted genius . drunk , boor , loyal friend , egotist , poor father , generous benefactor , are all labels that could apply to john ford . this biography verifies a lot of great stories and illuminates the secrets of the man . any fan of film can not afford to miss this work . henry fonda says ford was & quot ; a son of a bitch ... but a genius. & quot ; you will agree
this book provides a nice mix of tofu and non-tofu dishes that are easy to make with very few ingredients . the other plus of the book is that easy does n't mean just combining two canned foods to make a meal , but rather emphasizes fresh ( usually healthy ) ingredients .
i 've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments . now , in retrospect , it all seems sadly obvious . just put only <NUM> episodes on each of the last <NUM> discs ... and charge the same price ! [ sound of metallic breathing ] do not underestimate the power of the dark side ! ! ! on the positive side , i guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the `` complex '' variety and thus considerably advance the laughing man storyline . do n't get me wrong . this is a great chapter of stand alone complex , highlighted by a scene in which the laughing man pulls someone 's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire . if there 's a weak part of this installment , it 's the sequence with the `` armored suit '' , which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first gits film , just as the `` testation '' episode had done several installments back . the armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect . by the end of this installment , almost the entire shape and design of the laughing man plot seems clear . it is interesting to learn from the special features that the murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material
william as always is able to take difficult technical topics and make them easier to understand . i have been running vista since beta one , and this book is an excellent reference for those of us already familiar with windows operating systems . he does n't waste your time and jumps right in to explanations of the most significant changes in vista and how these impact working with vista . he divides the most complex topics into easy to understand sections and truly shows depth of understanding . as an mcse i have enjoyed reading william 's books for many years . i started out with his first pocket consultant about 8-9 years ago and have been getting every one he writes since . my understanding always increases several fold while reading his books whether a completely new subject or something more familiar . he always helps you understand subjects better and his always clear and concise approach is refreshing . you ca n't lose with stanek 's books . he knows how to zero in on what 's important . he understands it and writes from experience . this is an excellent book for those of us working in it . my support and developer friends are always stealing my copy of this book
this book was somewhat helpful . i used it during a course offered at my college campus . however , i would say that it is just as beneficial to use the powerprep cd they send you in the mail .
the book that i am reading is called heaven eyes . in this book it talks about a young girl named erin law and her two friends that live in a orphanage because their parents did not care for them . their orphanage owner 's name is marlene . when they run away they meet another child named heaven eyes that can see everything . heaven eyes is what started it all
i think it 's hard to listen to everyone talk about what punk rock was - to sort of link mc5 to the clash from west coast to east coast - the reality is - like any art movement it meant different things to different people . and while one dyed in the wool punk might say robert fripp 's guitar solos were punk , another will tell you that guitar solos are self-serving , bloated , and not at all about punk . i 've always felt that musicianship , of one form or another , has always been necessary , the reality is good punk rockers learned their craft well , and quickly - good punk rock , for me and mine - was never about flouting lack of skill ( and it was n't honestly lacking from the great ones ! ) . it was also never about punk fashion for my friends and i , and mostly for the original punk bands it was n't much about the `` punk '' fashion either . this set of disks documents largely what we all already knew - that there 's really no such thing as a distinct punk rock movement - and that the garage bands of the sixties , and the rock and roll created in sun studios in the 50s was all incendiary and necessary to something young people needed to do in the mid to late seventies . the ny movement vs. the english movement is well documented if a little disjointed here . i never had much use for the romantic lyrical style of the new york scene and while patti smith is a genious - she was never a punk to my ears . punk needed not just attitude , fashion , or stylistic differences - it also needed something to rail against . and no one did that better than the pistols and the clash - or more specifically lydon and strummer . both individuals specifically missing for different reasons from this documentary . instead we are treated to henry rollin 's rolling eyes - just fine , a chubby james chance , pretty good , and even a slightly softened siouxie - as they all coast into middle age . much of the 80s scene is excused from this movie - husker du , the minutemen , the fall , manchester in general ( besides some quick footage of the buzzcocks and a second with pete shelley ( a bit more of devoto ) ) and scads more - for a treatement of nirvana . time to stretch and yawn if you 're me . i liked nirvana , i think cobain was brilliant - however , it 's not punk - and if green day or rancid get face time - it 's only because the audience was long built and harnessed into place by those what came before . as they say . it was fun to see rollins dish a bit out to the likes of limp bizkit and there 's some choice extras on the <NUM> dvd set . and it 's always interesting to hear biafra talk ( i like him , you may not ) . all in all a good purchase for those of you who never saw footage of mc5 , or some of the other seminal acts of the early to mid seventies ( who cares about the new york dolls ? ? ? ) . however , it is a bit short ... about <NUM> minutes . rock music of any genre to really be complete needs to spend more time with the performances and less time with the interviews/reviews . having the ramones bash out loudmouth is either going to grab you or not . sonic youth is a performance band , they are far better in person than any recording they 've done . having any sniffin ' glue or punk paper ( and god i miss those old tiny print mimeographed fanzines - there was something so intimate and delicious about them ) tell us it was a seminal moment is unnecessary . if you step in a ring and get trounced by a great boxer , you do n't need some sideline personality tell you you got your ass whipped . ok : ) have fun
i really would just love to love this record , but i just hear too much of the other bands i like that it just does n't sound as good . of course this is the usual hardcore fare ( no it does n't have emo parts i 'm talking about real hardcore not emocore ) but it 's still good cuase they play it passionatly and you feel it man , you feel it . my favorite line is where he says `` i do n't need a crew to validate me '' man that line alone gave this an extra star . now hear is a note to those bandana wearing losers who love this album , if you are not in a gang do not wear a bandana ! if you are not robbing a bank , do n't wear a bandana ! if you are not riding a horse or fixing a fence please for the love of god do not wear a bandana . it 's stupid and you just look like a dork , you 'd just hate to see how many people roll their eyes when they see it ( but your sooooo cool you just ignore it when those `` normal '' people look at you ) . this music is not for emo wusses my friends , the kid does n't listen to dashboard ( from the sound of this record i 'd say more ensign and american nigtmare ... ) they listen to real hardcore music not whatever the hell loser music you `` hardcore '' kids like these days . would you see atreyu in these guys ' cd book ? hell no ! i 'd slap you if you even suggested it . so i 'm out and please i 'd like to beat <NUM> out of <NUM> so go ahead and say `` no '' you freaking dork
`` children of paradise '' is set in pre <NUM> paris , on boulevard of crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic . it is the story of infatuation , jealousy , deception , grief , murder , and true love lost forever . the film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named garance ( unforgettably played by arletty who was over <NUM> and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age ) and four men who love her - the famous mime baptist ( jean-louis barrault is matchless ) , the actor , frederick lemaitre , the criminal pierre-françois lacenaire , and the aristocrat comte de montray . she loved one of them and the affair was doomed . the film is so much more than just a romantic story ( which is absolutely beautiful and compelling ) - it is a love song to the art of theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism ( the film was made in paris during the nazi occupation under immensely difficult circumstances ) . jacques prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog ; marcel carne superbly directed the film . its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters , narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph . it is a <NUM> minutes long film but i cherished every minute of it .
wow on the reviews . they are much deserved . i saw the wipers live a number of times . remember they formed in about <NUM> . so i wouldnt call them post punk , but maybe the first westcoast punk band . the nirvana connection is warrented , since kurt cobain was a big fan of the wipers and saw many live shows . i agree with the others , the wipers arent a punk band . what is punk anyways . im <NUM> and heard the ramones in <NUM> , were they punk , no , they were pure rock n roll . greg sage has a style that defines original . greg if you read this , i saw you a bunch of times at the satyricon . also some industrial part of portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth . you missed about a half of sec , then kept singing . greg and the wipers , thx for the memories . zenorecords.com go to buy greg and wipers itmes . btw , roky erickson rocks . check his music out also .
this dvd is terrific . rather than describe the content , as most have , i 'll discuss the results . i 'm a rookie that plays with friends every couple of weeks . i 've been playing for less than a year . i had n't been a very winning player for a while , but went to vegas recently . i watched this dvd and studied the pre-flop strategy , odds chart and hold'em race odds charts , and decided to take a chance and enter a low-dollar tournament . what a blast- i finished 11th out of <NUM> players . the next night , i entered another tournament . i made it to the final table and placed in the money- 7th . wow , i thought i was going to be taken to the cleaners , but did pretty well against some clearly more experienced veterans . after returning from the trip , i immediately beat my friends , two games in a row . i had been getting my butt kicked by them for a couple of months now , so needless to say , this video has really turned my game around . i did n't realize how much i misunderstood about the game until i watched this video . i 'm doing things in reverse order- now i 'm going to purchase the first dvd to make sure i get the basics down , to add to these advanced techniques
the brave anna politkovskaya reveals the reality of russia today in this sad , sometimes horrifying book . after a brief window period of freedom under yeltsin , russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption , oppression and deception under putin . politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura . for example nina levurda , who in trying to establish the truth about her son 's death in the chechen war , became a victim of this system that when not cruel , is completely indifferent to the individual . this and other cases are discussed in the chapter my country 's army and its mothers . in russia , people imitate the man at the top , thus putin is the one who shapes russian society . it is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus . there are sections dealing with war criminals , brutality against privates in the military , government complicity in crime , the corruption in the judiciary , the struggle to survive in places like kamchatka , and racism against people with a non-slavic appearance . russia 's stability is of a monstrous type , where power means everything , few people hold the law in any regard , bribes keep business and the state running , and a free press has almost disappeared . putin 's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records , unheard of even under yeltsin or the communists . as a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel , he has the mentality of a soviet secret policeman . the yukos affair and the imprisonment of mikhail khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism . this process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout putin 's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second . the western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in russia . it is hard not to write russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book : the deliberate cruelties , the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media . mercifully there are still people like politkovskaya and lev ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out . this disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references .
vin diesel is the next big thing ! so the music is a match
this review is for my wife , marilyn , as our wedding song came from it : i was a senior in high school when this movie first hit the theaters and i loved it then and i love it now . yes , the acting is a bit hammy by laurence olivier who was attempting to appease the jewish population after giving an oscar-nominated performance a year or so before for playing with great relish a vicious nazi who tortures , via dentist equipment , dustin hoffman in `` the marathon man . '' can anyone forget his famous line from that film , `` is it safe ? '' in addition , lucie arnez is no great actress , but what she lacks in talent she makes up for in her charming honest portrayal as diamond 's compassionate agent . lastly , neil diamond is certainly no great actor either , no matter how much i love him as musician and entertainer , but this movie somehow works despite these noted flaws and some rather amateurish direction by richard fleicher . perhaps the movie succeeds because the plot is as timeless as hollywood gets . we all love to experience someone achieving his or her goals and that 's why these kinds of movies withstand the test of time even when the critics blast them . consider the following : while olivier hams it up a bit , he is still great to watch and demands your respect . lucie arnez is disarmingly charming in her role as an agent trying to help someone she believes in , but also trying not to be caught up in her client 's personal life . of course , neil diamond is no actor , but he is pleasing to watch and he 's certainly believable in a role that he was destined to play as it mirrors his own story quite a bit ; he came from a family of dentists and was expected to be one also , but he dropped out in his last semester and hit the road with a backpack and his guitar -- the rest is history . lastly , the music is awesome . diamond was at the height of his career musically when he did this film and the soundtrack produced <NUM> # <NUM> songs and was one of billboard 's longest running soundtrack best-sellers . this was no fluke as diamond had already won praise for his song `` be '' from the film `` jonathan livingston seagull . '' he knows how to write music for films and i wish he had more opportunities to do so . while the movie was n't necessarily `` a hit , '' but it did find a substantial audience and made a good profit . something about it made it work even though it is admittedly flawed . it went on to greater success on vhs and dvd and this new addition will probably sell just as well or better with the improved sound clarity that the other releases seriously lacked . i was happy to read here that i was n't the only one turning up the volume for the dialogue and lower it for the music segments . that drove me nuts in the earlier releases . moving along , although i am christian , i grew up in a mostly jewish section in brooklyn , new york , in fact , not far from where diamond and streisand actually grew up . my home was near diamond 's high school . anyhow , between that and having dated a wonderful jewish girl most of my high school days i grew to appreciate the jewish faith and culture . my neighborhood local theater re-released this film numerous times and i went to see it each time they played it . it was the first movie i took my wife to see back in april of <NUM> and she loved it and cried at the end as many in the theater did . the # <NUM> song `` hello again '' went on to become `` our song '' and the one we danced to at our wedding as your spouse should also be your best friend and that 's what the song is about and even the movie as well to some degree as diamond 's wife in the film never shared his interests or desires although she was aware of them since they were little kids growing up in the same neighborhood . she kept crying how he had changed when he became a pop-rock star when in reality his desires had simply come true . all she ever attempted to do in the film was either hold him back or ignore his dreams and a spouse should never do either of those . having said all this it is obvious that my love for diamond 's music , hollywoods tireless theme of success against the odds , watching any performance by the great olivier , and sharing this film with the woman i would eventually spend the next <NUM> years of my life with make me a bias reviewer here . i concede that observation , but still contend that in spite of this film 's obvious flaws , it is still great entertainment . enjoy this classic
for those who enjoyed `` road home '' here comes another wonderful version of an emotional film involving teachers . in this case the story is developing around the first love of an innocent village girl and the newly arrived teacher . in this mixture of sad and happy moments we can enjoy the innocence and purity of a young girl who discovers love for the first time , the effort of a teacher to remain impartial and fair as a teacher towards a girl that he started liking too . the involvement in the story of other teachers and people around their daily life , adds interest and emotion . soon the viewer is part of the story . the photography is magnificent and the music typical of the 60s . this wonderful selection of music is also a centerpiece in the development of the story . a very well balanced film , running smoothly and keeping the viewer interested , full of emotion , throughout the entire duration . highly recommended .
boyz ii men 's coolhighharmony is <NUM> of the best cd 's i ever bought . i luv it ! ! ! first , i was only getting the cd for the hit , `` end of the road '' . when i had just got the cd , i listend to the entire thing and soon i wasnt skipping tracks to go to end of the road , i was listening to the whole thing . every song on this cd is good . its been almost <NUM> years and i still favor this cd
fascinating look at how architecture and interior design influence our mood and behavior . you gain general priciples and insights into what makes an space inviting or unappealing . this is a great book for an architect or interior designer with an interest in environmental psychology . this is not a `` how to '' book for consumers who want remodeling ideas
this is an excellent book . i have had the grace to see first hand two of the incorruptibles whose stories are detailed here by joan carrol cruz ( saint catherine laboure and st. bernadette soubirous ) , and not even this wonderful book can prepare you for the experience . while her research is sound , even first rate , cruz has an easy to read prose that does not descend to the dry and academic . although cruz 's style is reverent , at times even bordering on devotional , this is an excellent book for catholic and non-catholic alike , skeptic and believer
if you bought this cd based upon alison and john waite 's `` missing you '' you are not going to find any other songs close to that on this cd . this is a cd of pure bluegrass and west virginia folk/melancholy and spiritual songs , beautiful and haunting as they are , particularly with alison 's voice . there are <NUM> or <NUM> guest artists here and they harmonize well with alison , but the bottom line is this is another cd of perfectly pure alison ( she produced this cd ) music that meets her standards and they are high .
i have heard several bohemes in my time - my favorites being the versions with pav and freni ; tebaldi and bergonzi ; and this one . neither of the first two can match this recording in overall effect . karajan with pav/freni , while firmly in possession of his own wonder , misses by a hair beecham 's sensuous conducting logic . also pav is not the best rodolfo : he sings too opulently to convey a blue , starving poet . the tebaldi/bergonzi set is a sure contender , and might have stood right with this one if its sound were n't so bad . now as for this set itself - three words say it : bjoerling with beecham . these were two of the finest artists of the last century , and it is a blessing to have this record of their collaboration . jussi , while perhaps not as romantic as bergonzi , was a rodolfo for all time . that ringing golden tenor truly could build castles in air . and hell , he was romantic enough for comfort . add beecham , and , if you please , you 've got glory . his pacing is perfect . just listen to about midway through `` che gelida manina , '' where bjoerling soars and beecham expands the tempo to let jussi 's voice raise the rafters and burn deep . and i tell you what , jussi could burn . the quantity of air that man had was astonishing at the least , and he did n't waste it : his phrases are easy , well-drawn , and thrilling . i have no important complaints about anyone else in the cast . i actually prefer de los angeles 's mimi , though i think she sometimes does n't support high notes with enough air . as for the orchestra , there are a few mishaps where accurate entrances with the singers are concerned , but that is hardly surprising - the ensemble was assembled in roughly two days and its memebers had barely played with one another or with beecham . the sound of the set is n't as good as one might expect from the great recordings series , but it is acceptable , and a well-informed ear can fill in any lacking overtones . buy it . you 'll love it for many years , and then pass down through your family
a sound and sensible approach to building workstations for your shop . if you have the perspective ( as i do ) that workstations are inthemselves `` tools '' , you will find this book valuable
the fact remains that everyone wants a jonny lang cd that sounds like every other jonny lang cd . he is amazing . noone could believe that such a young guy could have such a soulful voice . his soulfullness has not changed just the main sound of it . this cd provided me with the satisfaction to see how versitile his music can be and i was very pleasantly suprised . i recommend this cd to any jonny fan because he has proved that he is an ever evolving music artist . amazing
_in the fishtank_ is an ongoing venture of an independent record company that allows the free exchange of musical ideas between ( usually ) two bands . ultimately , the _fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises : a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique , but could also realistically ( though far-fetched perhaps ) fit in with any of the individual artists ' other recordings . the bands involved with this volume of _fishtank_ are isis and aereogramme , two bands that have some overlapping qualities , but are n't exactly the same by any means . this is the first and only _fishtank_ volume i have heard as of yet , but it is apparently a great success on more than one level . `` low tide '' starts with a tender , echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant . the reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of isis , but the singer of aereogramme handles the vocals . my first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like maynard james keenan 's quivering falsetto . just a bit . well maybe a bit more than a bit . either way , they sounded good . the track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea . `` delial '' gets off to a heavier start , and the hollow vocals of isis ' turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech . the third track , `` stolen '' is more relaxed , with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song , which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects . the _fishtank_ concept is a good idea , and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved . for having only two days to produce the songs , i 'd say both bands did a great job . i would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this , and for the price , it is another good impulse buy if you 're looking for something new . actually , i recommend getting all three albums in the isis/aereogramme trilogy that i have reviewed , along with _in the absense of truth_ and _seclusion_ , and listening to them in succession with the _fishtank_ in their midst . all else aside , this volume has prompted me to seek out the others
alex cross is back , and this time he 's after the butcher , the man who killed alex 's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since . this character , the butcher , is one of the more colorful in cross ' bag of collared criminals , and much of the book is spent in the butcher 's pov , which adds texture and depth to this novel . alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times , when he 's fretting over nana 's workload , how little time he spends with his kids , whether he could have done more to stop the murder of maria , his wife , some ten years ago . but alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down the butcher , and this is a chase i enjoyed . whether or not alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the fbi is a story line that did n't move me , so i 'm hoping he decides to go back , but patterson has another hit with cross , and this series just keeps going . for that , i am thankful
i 'd have to disagree with the review that called this & quot ; new age kitchenette music & quot ; . i find it difficult to meditate to music that has a lot of polarity to it or forces me to listen to it instead of listening to my inner self . the songs flow together . it may seem repetitious at times , but the songs are subtly individualistic . this group is anything but 'americanized ' . they 're a great blend of indian , arab and african flavor with a dash of celtic . the music also is the ideal pace for yoga as well , yet soft enough even to sleep to
i 've adored leahy since i stumbled across their first cd , several years ago . afaik , this is their first dvd , and i sincerely hope it 's the first of many . the dvd presents their first broadcast show for pbs . this family puts on a wonderful show , and the music they make is beyond outstanding . they combine traditional cape breton and irish/scottish fiddling syles with updated instrumental accompaniment in a way that injects modern vitality into already wonderful traditional musical styles . and donelle leahy , their lead fiddler , ca n't really be quite human ! do n't neglect to watch the `` additional performances '' section of the dvd -- it was a crime to cut * any * part of this production from the broadcast
lila downs is by far the most amazing vocalist of our time . i have all her cd 's and ca n't wait until the next . her music and live shows are inspiring and moving . she 's a latina who keeps it real and is proud of who she is , where she comes from and where she 's been . i had the honor of meeting her and her inner beauty surely compliments her outer beauty . her talent is moving , and her humility inspiring . i recommend this cd <NUM> % as well as all her others . hear it for yourself ... and catch her live performances when she 's in your town
after ja rule rose in popularity throughout the years since his debut , `` venni vetti vecci '' in <NUM> , now in <NUM> lots of things have changed . <NUM> cent and his g-unit crew rose up from the streets of new york and took the rap game by storm and their goal was to destroy ja rule and expose him as a poser . after numerous disses throughout the years when <NUM> and his clique were in the underground scene til <NUM> , ja rule 's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes . so with this release , `` blood in my eye , '' ja is out to prove that he still got that gangsta s * * * in him . can ja turn his career back around or will it further put him in the grave ? <NUM> . murder ( intro ) - no rating <NUM> . the life ( featuring hussein fatal , caddillac tah & james gotti ) - 4/5 <NUM> . clap back - minute+ talking intro - 4/5 <NUM> . the crown ( featuring sizzla ) - 4/5 <NUM> . kay slay ( skit ) - no rating <NUM> . things gon ' change ( featuring black child , young merc & d.o . cannons ) - 4.5/5 after track .... <NUM> punk a * * quarters ( skit ) - no rating <NUM> . race against time ii - 4.5/5 <NUM> . bobby creep ( skit ) - no rating <NUM> . n * * * * * & b * * * * * * - 4.5/5 <NUM> . the inc is back ( featuring shadow , sekou <NUM> & black child ) - 4/5 <NUM> . remo ( skit ) - no rating <NUM> . blood in my eye ( featuring hussein fatal ) - 4/5 <NUM> . it 's murda ( freestyle ) [ bonus track ] ( featuring hussein fatal ) - 4/5 <NUM> . the wrap ( freestyle ) [ bonus track ] ( featuring hussein fatal ) - 3.5/5 overall : 41/50 <NUM> stars ja rule does indeed return to his roots ..... somewhat . mostly every track has ja spitting with anger dissing <NUM> , eminem , dmx , dr. dre and mostly every other rapper who dissed him . he still got some pretty hot radio tracks but most of the album is filled with semi-hardcore tracks . this was the first `` flop '' in ja rules career . this album barely pushed over 400,000 units to date . still a pretty good record though , check it out
`` shinobi-heart under blade , '' is a fun and entertaining film . suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film ; and if you have viewed azumi <NUM> & <NUM> , or takeshi kitano 's film `` the blindswordman zatoichi , '' then you will enjoy this film . i was given this film by a friend as a christmas present , and just recently viewed it ; and i must write that i found it highly enjoyable . there is cgi in the film , but it did not bother me , considering the abilities of the various ninja 's depicted in the film would more or less require its use . also , the story itself is based from japanese manga , called `` basilisk . '' and although i have not had a chance to look at these , i might someday . just thought that i would pass this along . the film is set in 17th-century japan . in the film there are two shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years . the two tribes are called the iga and the kouga . they have been forced to obey a decree by the shogun who has unified japan , and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting . two of the ninja 's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love : they are oboro ( yukie nakama ) and gennosuke ( jo odagiri ) however , both must keep it a secret . the shogun however , sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him , and decides that a tournament be held . five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death . these different ninja characters are extremely colorful . each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting . as i wrote in the beginning , this is not an akira kurosawa type film , such as `` seven samurai , '' therefore , suspension of disbelief is necessary . moreover , you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a kurosawa film : so what ! the film is a fun watch anyway . i would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film , however , i can live with this , as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy . however , the acting in the film is very good . since the film comes from comic and anime origins , the characters do not dissapoint the viewer . the film seems a bit comic-book at times , but that is one of the reasons i think i enjoyed the film so much more . and besides , the visuals i believe were done incredibly great . also , while not like your typical japanese film , in terms of swordplay , the film is still enjoyable : remember this does derive from manga . in the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight : the winners will serve the shogunate , the loser will be vanquished . all of the fights take place while enroute to the capital , while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind . ( jo odagiri ) and ( yukie nakama ) give good acting perfomances in the film , which in turn makes this a better film . once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'romeo and juliet , ' to some degree . once again , this is an enjoyable japanese film , not to be taken seriously , or on par with some of the great samurai epics of the past , just an enjoyably entertaining film . also , i thought some of the characters ' powers , such as one ninja being able to slow down time were interesting , as it departs so much from much of japanese cinema , in contrast to chinese cinema , where this is so prevalent . all in all , a delightful and fun film . enjoy it , and do n't take it too seriously . [ stars : 4.5
this book has provided me with a hands on guid that i have search for many years . i am new to animation , and i think mr. mitchell did a fantastic job of explaining and making his real world application easy to follow . this book has taught me more about professional animation than any other books in my library . to me the cd is an added bonus . i would highly recommend this book to any beginner who is trying learn 3d animation production . the only negative thing i have to say is , why it took you so long to publish a book that gave someone like me the confidence in learning 3d animation . i was able to create my first animated characters by using this book , by adding this book to your library , you will be gaining a wealth of knowledge . by the way , when is your next book coming out ? simply , this book is great
laskowski creates a amazingly insightful and poignant look into the mind and spirit of a man with a brain injury who lives in a group home in montana . the novel explores robert 's relationships with his caregivers , his parents , his son , and his peers in prose that is honest , thorough , and poetic . beyond being just a book about brian injury , this is a book about the general human condition , about someone wanting to be the best he can be , about someone trying to relate meaningfully with parents and child , about someone trying to navigate succesfully our confusing postmodern world . a must read
the best action movie i 've seen this year is n't in theaters . you may think you 've seen it , but probably have n't . `` payback '' is back , this time the way the director envisioned the film , not the suits . `` you do n't make pictures for the elite , '' producer/star mel gibson says today , explaining why paramount and warner bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director brian helgeland . after <NUM> days of reshoots , a new final ( third ) act was tacked on , voiceover was added a la `` blade runner '' and kris kristofferson walked on as a new major character . audiences still were amazed how brutal the gibson character was when they had to `` get ready to root for the bad guy , '' as the marketing had it . same old story about artists and hollywood , but this time came a happier ending . in <NUM> , paramount and gibson gave helgeland another shot at the film , eight years after its release . the tapes turned up missing , so helgeland and his editor recut the film using film . and so we have `` payback : straight up -- the director 's cut . '' now , this is one hard-boiled movie . gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot , and his wife , following a heist . along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and asian drug dealers , slugs a woman ( a scene the studios cut ) , and stirs up a john woo-like shootout as the bloody finale . supporting actors lucy liu , gregg henry and maria bello all do fine work . there are multiple dvd extras , including a director 's commentary , but the one to catch is the half-hour `` same story -- different movie , '' all about the film 's resurrection . audio and video are sharp on the dvd -- and better on high definition discs , although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty , bleach-bypass film . `` payback '' comes from the same book as `` point blank '' with lee marvin , an even better film from <NUM>
i thought this was an absolutely beautiful book . hansberry had such a gift for writing about the human spirit . i hope that the students who say they got nothing from reading this book come back to it as adults and give it another try . i found it to be inspiring . it will definitely join my list of favorites
a true story that 's still touching lives today & for the forseeable future too the insider tells the true story of how jeffrey wigand [ played by russell crowe ] told the world what the major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers posed to consumers by their cigarettes . the insider is presented with tangible class and with an appropriately heavy docudrama feel . in my opinion , `` the insider '' is director michael mann 's best film to date and was nominated for seven academy awards . excellent acting by pacino , crowe and plummer . yes - there is a price to pay for being a whistleblower & it comes in many thankless forms ! ! ! ! ! the film 's setting is saturated with an eerie and believable atmosphere of paranoia . the sinking feeling that the unseen enemy [ the tobacco company ] will be coming from somewhere seems to be both infectious and believable throughout the film . the price wigand pays for his integrity is dear and continues to this day . his personal loss rivals the tobacco company 's but unlike them he consciously decided to do the `` right thing '' regardless of that cost . amplifying the significance of wigand 's whistle blowing decision , where in effect <NUM> man [ jeffrey wigand ] does stand up completely alone against the threats of big tobacco , cbs `` corporate '' caves in to the tobacco company 's lawsuit threats . after taping the interview cbs corporate hits the chicken switch over airing mike wallace 's interview with wigands much as the tobacco company had hoped the wistleblower would have . this subplot through analogy clearly demonstrates the power of one ordinary man against a powerful corrupt system and clearly illustrates how <NUM> person can still make a big difference . jeffrey wigand standing up to be counted did make a difference in this case . a huge difference ! yes - -1 person can make a difference : a big difference here ! on a smaller scale the filmakers ' effort here is another example of how <NUM> man can make a difference though the risk is far smaller . interestingly , though the film was nominated for <NUM> academy awards it came away with none . i guess whistleblowing for a just cause will still have to be its own reward . * -- * abridged list of the cast * -- * al pacino - lowell bergman russell crowe - jeffrey wigand christopher plummer - mike wallace diane venora - liane wigand philip baker hall - don hewitt lindsay crouse - sharon tiller debi mazar - debbie de luca stephen tobolowsky - eric kluster colm feore - richard scruggs bruce mcgill - ron motley rip torn - john scanlon lynne thigpen - mrs. williams nestor serrano - fbi agent robertson pete hamill - n.y. times reporter michael moore - michael moore * -- * abridged but extensive list of [ much awarded ] production crew * -- * michael mann - director / producer / screenwriter pieter jan brugge - producer marie brenner - short story author eric roth - screenwriter dante spinotti - cinematographer pieter bourke - composer ( music score ) lisa gerrard - composer ( music score ) graeme revell - composer ( music score ) william c. goldenberg - editor david rosenbloom - editor paul rubell - editor brian morris - production designer avi avivi - art director john kasarda - art director marjorie stone mcshirley - supervising art director james tocci - art director michael waxman - co-producer / first assistant director gusmano cesaretti - associate producer kathleen m. shea - associate producer lynn christopher - set designer nancy haigh - set designer kelly hannafin - set designer beth kushnick - set designer chris spellman - set designer darrell l. wight - set designer anna sheppard - costume designer doug hemphill - sound/sound designer andy nelson - sound/sound designer lee orloff - sound/sound designer bonnie timmerman - casting gregg baxter - sound editor gregory king - sound editor * -- * abridged list of major awards & nominations * -- * best actor ( nom ) russell crowe <NUM> academy best adapted screenplay ( nom ) eric roth <NUM> academy best adapted screenplay ( nom ) michael mann <NUM> academy best cinematography ( nom ) dante spinotti <NUM> academy best director ( nom ) michael mann <NUM> academy best editing ( nom ) david rosenbloom <NUM> academy best editing ( nom ) william c. goldenberg <NUM> academy best editing ( nom ) paul rubell <NUM> academy best picture ( nom ) <NUM> academy best sound ( nom ) doug hemphill <NUM> academy best sound ( nom ) lee orloff <NUM> academy best sound ( nom ) andy nelson <NUM> academy best cinematography ( nom ) dante spinotti <NUM> american society of cinematographers best actor ( nom ) russell crowe <NUM> british academy awards best actor ( win ) russell crowe <NUM> broadcast film critics association best director- feature film ( nom ) michael mann <NUM> directors guild of america best actor ( drama ) ( nom ) russell crowe <NUM> golden globe best director ( nom ) michael mann <NUM> golden globe best film ( drama ) ( nom ) <NUM> golden globe best original score ( nom ) lisa gerrard <NUM> golden globe best original score ( nom ) pieter bourke <NUM> golden globe best screenplay ( nom ) eric roth <NUM> golden globe best screenplay ( nom ) michael mann <NUM> golden globe about the dvd : excellent sound and video but very short of features . <NUM> minute featurette is very inadequate for this type of film !

p.d . james , aka phyllis dorothy james white , has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades . her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted . her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again . james ' heroine in this book , cordelia grey , lacks the long and rich legacy of adam dalgliesh - the author 's usual sharp-witted and charming p.i. , but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in . mature and wise beyond her years - cordelia is only <NUM> when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist . brave and insightful sometimes , scared and confused often , cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual ( for this genre ) denoument . i wo n't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused adam dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down cordelia 's defenses . cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of james ' novels . she later , mistakenly she says , sold cordelia , or the rights to her existence anyway , to the bbc , which subsequently did a tv series based on the character . i picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of `` bests '' for this genre - most recently in an essay by anna quindlan . i have n't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story , the lovable cordelia , and for the craftsmanship of the author . recommended
check out augustana , without doubt last year 's most promising new band , completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that 'd be epic , which has been in a tailspin since polly anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist . their debut album , the extraordinary all the stars and boulevards , was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and , minus even a modicum of press or publicity , got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases ; its soaring title track -- one of ` <NUM> 's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy . so how 's this for a dark horse story ? practically as an afterthought as spring closed , epic chose as boulevards ' second single the wistful , resplendent `` boston '' and then sat on their dead , numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band 's twenty-one-year-old ( ! ) lead singer dan layus ( think <NUM> doors down 's brad arnold with a more agile voice , and much much cuter ) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily , week on week , against all conventional wisdom which states that summer , with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments , is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex , chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation , and whose back half , in lieu of a repetitive refrain , rockets to a soul-cleansing , cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings . now there 's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that epic re-released boulevards last week with extra tracks , an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me , if for no other reason than i 'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin ' record , and that 's what they count on , but if it helps augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be , all will be forgiven .
i just love thailand ! ! ! i 've been to all the locations the movie was shot at , which gives it that much more appeal and familiarity ! a star gets taken away for the obvious movie mistakes . when will they learn machine guns do not have unlimited rounds , and they are not double action and click multiple times after the rounds have finished . an m16 expends its 30rd mag in less than <NUM> secs at full auto - same for the ak-47 . the amount of violence was superb
two lights by five for fighting is probably his best work so far . i highly recommend buying this cd
if you want one book on categorical data analysis , this is the one . but there are others that are easier to read , if your math is not great ( including the same author 's book with an almost identical title
funniest , most bizarre , disgusting comedy i have ever seen and dvd has both great color and sound . it is best when watched with all your friends ! you will laugh yourselves right off the couch ! for the outrageous , sick-minded , cult classic movie-lover who wants to see every movie containing gore , violence and sex performed by cute , cuddly-looking , love-sick , violent , disgusting , vulgar , uncouth puppets . adults should watch before they let their children as this film is probably not intended for most children !
this new album by former mr.big guitar player paul gilbert is a nice surprise ! beatle-esque melodies coupled with good leading and backing vocals , not forgetting the intrincate , fast melodic guitar riffs and chops make this a delicious cd . highlights include the first track & quot ; get it & quot ; with its infectious theme and the ballad & quot ; kate is a star & quot ; . listen to flying dog and have a good time
i had been working out on a stability for about <NUM> months and i thought this would be a change of pace for me and figured being a `` beginner '' workout i would n't have a problem . boy was i wrong ! i felt like a true beginner as i worked through the routine and was wobbling all over . regardless , i still `` felt '' the results of the workout . it took me several repetitions to start to control myself on the ball and feel like i was actually mastering the moves . this routine now has a permenant place in my exercise rotation and i love all that i 'm able to do . do n't be scared away . stick to it and you 'll love the way it makes you feel and the results you 'll get
the truth shall set you free ... might be a more apt title for this little 'made for tv ' gem in which jim carrey stars in one of his first roles . 'doing time on maple drive ' is a powerful drama about one family 's cathartic acceptance of the truths which threaten to destroy it . on the surface , the carters are the epitome of the 'perfect ' suburban family . three handsome children , neatly trimmed front lawn , the flag waving outside . the all-american family . the first scenes tell everything . while the stars and stripes hang outside the front door , lisa carter ( bibi besch ) polishes the family pictures as if they were sacred relics , masks of a happiness that is conspicuously absent from this family . lisa sets the table for the arrival of their youngest son , matt ( william mc namara ) and his bride-to-be , allison ( lori laughlin ) . next scene and father ( james sikking ) pulls up the driveway with his eldest son , tim . the black sheep of the family , tim is just there as a sad reminder of what he 'could have been . ' he could have gone to west point if he had n't flunked out , if had he just done what his father had wanted him to do . and now , he is the household ghost , symbol of failure , burden to his parents . ignored , he takes to the bottle which further alienates him from his family . his father wo n't even let him pass through the front door lest mom smell the stench of alcohol . and this is just the tip of the iceberg . the carters are masters at seeing what they want to see . denied the successful son with tim , they place all hopes on matt . young and handsome , he soon plans to marry his yale sweetheart , allison and walk into the role of perfect child , fulfilling the wishes of his parents . and somewhat pushed to the back is the daughter , karen ( jayne brook ) . married and theoretically 'free ' from her family , she is still prisoner to her father 's expectations , rather than partner to her journalist husband . he wants a child , but she 's afraid her father might not approve . the film reaches its climax with skill and tension . and the clues that something is amiss are everywhere . why is n't tim going to be best man at matt 's wedding ? and why is n't matt 's best friend from yale being invited to the wedding ? smiles are forced , subjects are avoided and nobody listens to one another , until the outsider , allison , refuses to join the game . by chance , she finds a love-letter from matt addressed to his university friend , kyle , the one strangely missing from their wedding 's guest list . not only is matt forced to acknowledge who he is , he has to explain to his family why his bride-to-be has suddenly called off the wedding . matt tries to escape this confrontation by nearly killing himself . surviving the car crash , he still has to survive the even more painful crash with his family . will the carters survive the shattering of their wall of forced smiles , family photos , and lies ? 'doing time on maple drive ' does a wonderful job of dissecting the so-called 'dysfunctional family . ' the perfomances are tight and convincing all across the board , especially those of william mcnamara and james b. sikking . their father-son relationship is portrayed with power and tenderness . carrey 's performance is also tops , proving just how versatile an actor he is . my favorite though was lori loughlin . she managed to play the part of star-struck lover thrown a hard one brilliantly . she 's fascinating to watch as she starts to doubt matt 's honesty and is forced into a truly painful decision . ken olin 's film is a must for those of us who know the carter 's dilemma first hand . cathartic and instructive , 'doing time on maple drive ' leaves you with a guarded optimism , an affirmation that the truth can not only set us free but keep us together as well .
my anticipation is so great that i can hardly contain myself . i 'm counting down the days , no , the minutes till it arrives at my doorstep . when it does , i fear that i just may very well keel over with a heart attack and die i wo n't be able to stand it . i can only hope my poor heart will hold out long enough for me to actually watch the movies . i will be so happy then .
i am not familiar with alan jackson as i am not a country music afficianado but that does not mean i dislike country music . i think country music is wholesome , down to earth and i can relate to it very much . not many songs on this dvd but the price is low so not much more can be expected . in my opinion `` remember when '' is worth twice the price of the dvd itself . after you watch it you might cry ( as i did ) or kiss your wife or hug your kids . beautiful , meaningful . you will not regret purchasing this dvd
the other side of war offers the most human look at the day to day impact of war on women worldwide . it is a story of tragedy and loss and more importantly a story of courage and resiliency . in text and astonishingly beautiful photographs , we see strong women who refuse defeat and claim victory in small and great ways each and every day .
i give this book <NUM> stars because i still have alot of questions and skepticism in some of the wildly , new to me , ideas in this book . i like sylvia brown 's deep sense of spirituality and her abilities have convinced me she is real at what she does . i do n't think she is trying to fool anyone . i am a seeker and am approaching the things she talks about in this book with as much an open mind as i possibly can be . the chapter on the lost continent of atlantis was the chapter that was pushing me the most . although i do believe there is life in the universe beyond our own the atlantis story is really out there . of course , i have not done any reading about this subject before so who am i to judge it . there maybe very similar views in other books about atlantis and her explaination did make sense when compared the ages of people of atlantis to those in the book of genesis reaching in the <NUM> and <NUM> yrs old . from crystal skulls to loch ness monster to spontaneous human combustion it is all an interesting and fun read ! ! but if you buy this book you will have to take what you can use and just leave the rest
i for some reason was resistant to reading `` the hobbit '' when a teen-ager . i was not resistant to seeing these movies ; i just did n't take the time . to be honest , i found it hard to get into the movie . an hour into it , i could have given up on it . after seeing the first movie ( i was a little disappointed to feel like i only saw an incomplete story ) , i am interested in seeing the sequel , but not so interested that i 'm rushing to get it or where i 'll feel i missed out if i never find out how the story ends ( which i 'm sure will be good being victorious over evil ) . i 've just explained why i only gave this movie four stars . now , let me tell you why it earned that many ( in case you could n't tell from the other 3000+ reviews ) . the special effects were great . but so was the acting . very effective was ian holm , ian mckellan , john rhys-davies ( remember him from raiders of the lost ark ? ) , liv tyler , viggo mortenson , and christopher lee . another thing i enjoyed about it is some philosophical insights , introduced by gandalf the grey , especially the advice he gave to froddo on his decision to move forward
it is good that men should dwell together . men should share their experiences with eachother
yes , please take me back to <NUM> , to new york in <NUM> , or even back to rio de janeiro , a couple of years before , where i met rona jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous `` sacha 's '' nightclub , where rona was already drafting her novel mentally ... when the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the seagram 's building , one could actually walk-up to lovely suzy parker and chat with her about how real was the `` new morality '' of the liberated new york girls in the executive suites , decades before sex and the city became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the sixties . at night we had the many parties thrown by negulesco and his charming wife , while stephen boyd was being charming to my wife , brazilian actress mariza woodward , featured in life magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in rio . oh , yes , take me back ! and if you were not there then , if you were not even born then , do get this dvd and visit new york <NUM> and see how charmingly it all started , despite where it eventually ended
matthew spender has something to offer for someone really curious about this artists work . i have been compairing the three biographies . herrara 's book has been much acclained . but , when it comes to getting into the nitty -gritty of an artist 's work , spender is better . particularly when he writes of his work in the fields of virginia.none of the other writers have really tackled this important part of gorky 's art . as a sculpture spender must have wondered would gorky like me and my work.the armenian backgound has been covered by quite a few books . none can surpass some of spenders insight into gorky 's creative process.a shortcomihg of this biography is the lack of color reproductions of the paintings.his choice of photos of the family of gorky , give us a glimpse of his background . the paper back ( a catalogue ) `` the breakthrough years /arshile gorky '' would be a good companion book of this bio as it has ample repros and an essay by spender among others ; aupling for one
i wo n't go on about the contents of this nice boxset as it has all been addressed already , but i thought i should add that upon receiving my shipment today i was dismayed to find all <NUM> discs rolling around free from their hubs ! this poor packaging virtually guarantees damage to the dvds ... if it was n't limited i would demand a replacement , but i 'm not sending mine back and hope they still have one to replace it . the replacement would more than likely have the same loose dvd problem anyway . boxset <NUM> stars , packaging ( disc protection rated only ) <NUM> stars . disappointed
i 'm in the uk and therefore it cost me quite a lot to have this package shipped over the atlantic but it 's the only way to see this series until way into next year . as has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the dts disc ( the very one i want ) is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last <NUM> miles ! the disc surface is now scratched and damaged . i see no point in sending it back to amazon for replacement because the chances are it 'll happen again so i 'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance . this item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it 's a great shame
this cd rocks ! i bought it years ago and still listen to it all the time . i love the indigo girls
similar to other books in his us history series , vidal engages the reader immediately into conspiracies and dramas by introducing a wide panorama of characters . vidal is able to use burr 's assistant , charles schuyler , as the chief storyteller , allowing the narrative to skip around through time . vidal likes to have the narrator tell the reader that the past `` is n't like it is now , '' which he would not be able to do if the story followed a strict chronological series . characters are given incredible depth as they all have their dark faults to go with their heroic strengths . vidal takes shots at the big guys . some shots are substantial ( like saying washington was a poor leader who never lead the army into a victory and only won the war because of france ) and some are petty ( washington repeatedly viewed as having a `` big butt '' and often referred to as `` waddling '' ) . jefferson is especially scrutinized . besides the ubiquitous presence of light-skinned slaves insinuated to be of the jefferson line , jefferson is portrayed as a cold , calculating `` philosopher king '' who uses the constitution when it supports his causes , but calls for `` states rights '' when the constitution contradicts him . aaron burr , who despite all the nasty politicking going on around him , is portrayed as a gentleman who is constantly antagonized by his peers for trying to do the right thing . how he obtains so much power in the state of new york is not really pursued except to say he is a war hero . also , tammany is often mentioned in the background , but burr 's involvement is not pursued . however , burr is always described as having control of the new york constituencies that he can influence when making deals with the virginia `` junta . '' my only negative critique is i find it hard to believe that burr was vilified by conspirators without having character flaws that might have contributed to his rise and fall . burr is always the benevolent gentleman while the other power mongers of the day ( washington , jefferson , and hamilton ) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience . vidal freely flings the mud at other historical heroes , but seems a little too defensive and paranoid about the reputation of aaron burr . still , the book is rich with historical vignettes of burr 's meetings with various patriotic heroes . vidal writes with enough veneration to let you know the characters are great and enough vindication to make them real .
i would have preferred to have seen this film in it 's original mandarin language track but i do not feel it is necessary to knock this edition . i also take the unfashionable opinion that `` reservoir dogs '' , quentin tarantino 's homage ( not rip-off ) to `` city on fire '' , is the better of the two films . `` reservoir dogs '' beats this film in terms of style and characterization if not completely original . that said , this is a highly engaging film . it has a compelling central premise of a police undercover operative who not only has to fear the crooks he 's infiltrating but his superiors who view him with contempt . there is action here for sure but it does n't subvert the story . i recommend this film for any fan of hong kong action films but if a mandarin edition becomes available check that out instead
this is an excellent book , written by one of the authorities in the field . it offers detailed design techniques that will help the system designer explore the 3-dimension design space and achieve optimizations in all or either of : area , time , energy consumption . the use of specific examples illustrates the techniques , while complicated backround information is well-organized in the appendices . i used the book as a recommended text book in my 1-semester `` vlsi signal processing '' graduate-level class and the students really loved it . it covers all availble techniques , from the simplest to the most advanced ones , with full explanation of the theory , with complete and detailed implementation steps for a wide range of signal processing algorithms.since the book does not deal with the design at the physical level , but with transformations of the processing algorithms so that their vlsi implementations will satisfy certain criteria of optimality , it is not absolutely mandatory that the reader has already taken courses in vlsi design , although this could help appreciate the benefits offered by the techniques detailed in the book . the exercises found at the end of each chapter help the reader apply the learned techniques in all kinds of applications . i am convinced that the thoroughness and the high standards accomplished by the author in the writing of this book will help establish it as the leading text or reference book for several years to come
i learned about debra ponzek from a nick jr . newsletter at my child 's daycare center in connecticut . i tried her cowboy cookies recipe from the article and i was hooked on ponzek . it 's pretty cool that she is a connecticut resident as well . i love the fact that recipes are kid-friendly with adult appeal . no smiley faced plates , ... just yummy food . i 've only had the cookbook for <NUM> weeks and have enjoyed the following recipes : tuna , pasta & celery salad , fresh mayo , spinach salad with dried cherries , almonds , & blue cheese , ham , cheddar & tom quesadillas , arugula and proscuitto pizza , aux delices marinara , rigatoni with ricotta , tomato , and basil , two simple sauces of basil-lemon pesto and sweet tom marmalade which i served with pan-seared tilapia , and vegetable fried rice . my hands-down fave has been the pizza . the aux delice sauce is my fave to date & i 've made many from the food tv network chefs
this is a singular masterpiece in film making but totally unlike anything , even for it 's day . by today 's attention deficit disorder standards , this film is really really odd . but no doubt it is a masterpiece if the viewer is willing to put the effort in to catch all the nuances because this is a film of nothing but nuances . tati himself is just one of many participants . there is a plot of sorts dealing with a group of female american tourists and the one women who is the odd duck among them . she meets tati and they spend the night together dancing at a night club and see in the dawn at a coffee shop . various bits of business are constantly swirling around them and you could view this picture <NUM> times before seeing everything . there are many jokes but they are gentle visual puns . do n't expect belly laughs , just a wry but amazing view on modern life . as is standard practice for criterian these days the extras on disc two are spectacular . the documentaries on tati 's life and this film are brilliant and helped me understand his art and this film much better . a gentle film with brilliant use of wide screen ( this film would make no sense pan and scan ) you need to fall into the picture to enjoy it . but there is an endless wealth of material to enjoy
i remember reading this book as a child and loving it . now <NUM> and in my 3rd year of college , i come back to the memeories of this book and the stories . still vivid in my mind is the picture of little bear going outside in the cold weather only to return home asking his mother for something warm to wear and in the end relazing he had his own fur coat all along , and then him taking off to the moom . i 'm studying to become a teacher and making a book list for one of my classes and this is sure to be on there
... do n't pass tower of power by . this band is smokin . ' they have it all , great vocals , great compositions , great horns and arrangements . i would have loved to see man from the past on this one , but overall a very solid collection . so very hard to go is top notch material - one of my all time favorites and they have so many great tunes - below us all the city lights , down to the nightclub , what is hip , this times it 's real , only so much oil . easily one of the best bands from the <NUM> 's . got to have this one
here we have another parody of the giant robot anime genre ( mostly making fun of evangelion ) . the basic plot is that a teenage guy sees giant city-smashing robots where no one else does , a mad scientist is convinced that this is evidence of a parallel universe , and the mad scientist sends the guy ( along with the mad scientist 's daughter ) to the parallel universe where ( surprise ) the guy gets to pilot the giant robots . this series does n't take itself too seriously , or try to get into the deeper questions of the meaning of life or anything , but instead tries to tell a simple adventure story ( in the format of the typical teen-age guy gets chased around by every girl in sight ) of a boy and his giant mecha . the show is only <NUM> episodes long , but this length suits it well , as to make the series go on longer would just reduce half of the show to filler . the <NUM> episode format keeps things tight . as far as pioneer animation shows go , this is one of the better ones ( my favorite still being battle athletes victory ) . the animation and character designs are good , and the cgi and traditional animation melds well ( for the most part ) . the action sequences are n't really mind-blowing ( except perhaps for some of the early ones in the show { like the one where our protagonist jumps into a fallen mecha and saves its pilot by destroying the enemy attacking her } ) . the music is n't too bad , except for when it 's not there ( maybe it 's supposed to be dramatic or atmospheric , but a few times i found myself getting bored ) . the characters are all pretty likable ( and especially the alternate mitsaki , one of the nicest , cutest , sweetest , most attractive girls in all of anime ) , and some of the dialog and situations are pretty funny ( although on the whole i 'd say that the comedy was largely hit-and-miss ) . if you 're a fan of mecha , and particularly mecha comedies , you should probably give this one a rent at the least . if you like its style it 's probably worth a purchase .
`` of malice & the magnum heart '' is basically a farewell to two friends of the band who died in a horrific car accident . throughout this entire album , you can feel the hurt , pain , and anger of the days following the tragedy . a very good album , and one that needs to be listened to by anyone who has ever lost loved ones in their life
this translation is excellent for those people who thought , i didnt equate that verse with the character of god . there are no yes and no scriptures and this translation throws new light on the verses that didnt seem right in the king james . bless god , knowledge will indeed increase in these last days .
this film is about finding a nazi approximately <NUM> years after world war ii in order to assassinate him . the mossad agent , eyal , just returned from turkey and killed a terrorist there . his new assignment is to be a tour guide to a young german named alex himmelman , whose grandfather was the nazi killer . the plan is to get friendly with this tourist and learn whether or not his grandfather is still alive , then `` to do god 's work before god is ready to take him '' according to the director of mossad . the elder himmellman is believed to be alive in argentina where he escaped after the war . unfortunately , when eyal arrives home after the turkish assignment , he finds his wife dead on their bed . she had committed suicide ... this life-altering event may affect his judgement and skills according to his superior . he is offered counseling but declines . his shooting abilities are tested on a target range from time to time , to ensure he is able to complete this important mission . the film is fascinating on many levels . it delves into a deeply serious subject and questions the ethics of doing this type of work in a most creative and artistic manner . as eyal becomes more friendly with alex and his sister pia who lives on a kibbutz , he begins to like them . eyal places a bug in pia 's apartment to catch any conversation they may have about their grandfather 's past . the conversations are all innocent until one night , when alex tries to pursuade pia to return to berlin to visit her parents , to attend her father 's birthday party . it turns out , pia had a huge fight with her dad about the cover-up of what her grandfather had done during the war . one does wonder , why does the granddaughter of a nazi end up working in a kibbutz in israel ? the film builds suspense and mystery based on this very question . the complex nature of the film makes it a superior viewing experience . the subject of the film is dealt with in a senstive manner and is balanced with humor . eyal is played by a very handsome israeli actor who befriends alex and then learns by chance that alex is gay . this subject is presented in a natural flow within the story line of the film ... the metaphor of `` walking on water '' as jesus did on the sea of galilee is used with great affect and meaning . the viewer will be thrilled and entertained as intensity builds and the mysteries become more complex before they are resolved . there is a huge unexpected climax before the surprise ending brings about a <NUM> degree resolution to the conflicts . this is a most highly recommended viewing experience . erika borsos ( pepper flower
i 've always been a fan of this film , though it was n't until recently that i got to see it all the way through to the end . in 2d , `` creature ... '' is good , but only that . since this film was intended to be seen in true 3d form , and that does n't mean in the crappy red & blue anaglyph glasses version , that really is the best way to see it . gladly , the field sequential 3d edition is available from two web sites and it is fantastic . the stereo depth really makes the movie better than ever . plus , all the dimensional sight gags work instead of just making you wonder why they were filmed that way . being able to experience the stereo depth of the beautiful underwater photography , even in black & white , leaves you wanting more in the end . i highly recommend `` creature from the black lagoon '' , but only in 3d using the shutter glasses system found in the `` ultimate 3d collection '' from amazon.com ( buy it cheap from a used & new seller )
it borders on obsession . i think he 's incredibly talented and i love him and all his music . this christmas album really put me in the spirit . it actually reminded me of when i was a little kid and christmas still seemed like a religious holiday . i am now an athiest , but somehow listening to sufjan sing about jesus just makes me happy . my favorite songs are `` put the lights on the tree '' and `` come thou fount of every blessing . ''
this is one of miyazaki 's best . in the vein of 'totoro ' but a bit more grown-up . it 's probably my favourite after 'nausicaa ' , which is his masterpiece . there is a quality to miyazaki 's animation and story-telling that is indescribable . you have to experience it to understand it . the attention to detail and the intimacy in his narration is really special . though it 's probably easier ( for english speakers ) to watch the movie with the english dialogue , it 's so much better with the original japanese soundtrack . the english dialogue lacks the softness and subtlety of the japanese version . this is a great family film ; a film people of all ages can enjoy . i am definitely going to be buying the dvd , 'cos i 'm going to want to share this movie with friends and family
the cover photo of an alert non-gerber baby . an old family photo topping each chapter . these help set a whimsical tone skillfully followed through with words only a mother could love . from tufted-head to stubbed-toe , this book celebrates the spunk of youth with countless recalls of which our inner tot can relate . we could long for a dad like hers -- who loved his third child enough to casually coin her zippy . through her eyes , this family does n't take itself too seriously . how zippy organizes and rationalizes daily undertakings is felt as youthful , reads as youthful . the flightiness of friendships , unnerving nature of neighbors and natural distancing from parents are all taken in stride and delicately expressed . she 's a child with shameless pride in plainness . any precociousness is thankfully not odious . this folk-child character seems too clever to be actual , too enlightened to be real , but we 're more than happy to play along . the book 's subtle intrigue -- all well told with a perception that belies its na√Ø¬ø¬Ωve charm . haven kimmel has pulled off some retro-realism with finesse . a delightful and amusing read .
the ozark mountain daredevils will probably always be my very favorite american band . i believe they would have been my fave regardless , but they have a special sentimental cache for me -- i came from the same town they are from ( springfield , mo ) and in the <NUM> 's , we got to hear them often . the secret of the daredevil 's music was that it made you feel really good . i ca n't think of a single unit of musicians who so consistently produced music that can make you feel better . the music on this album , and many of the records that followed just seem to clear your head of all bad thoughts . the daredevils are first-rate singers , musicians , and songwriters . they 're just the best . always have been , always will be ... this is what american music was supposed to be about . thanks , guys ..
two weeks ago my girlfriend snow and i dined at tetsuya 's new restaurant mju at the millenium knightsbridge hotel in london , prompted by snow 's raving of tetsuya from her winters in sydney . the only dining option is an eight-mini-course tasting menu , but since the man himself was in town ( tetsuya spends only one week a month in london ) we were all for it . we thought the portions were adequate , but i suspect people used to nyc portions might go home hungry . i must say that his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients , and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items . although the presentation of the food was highly stylised - just look at the photos in the cookbook and they are similarly presented at your table - the cooking is unfussed and the philosophy predominantly reflected the japanese appreciation for simplicity and french classical culinary techniques . the result was that every dish managed to emphasize yet enhance the flavor of the main ingredient . compared to nobu , tetsuya is hardly fusion and very asian at heart . most of the courses served at mju are included in the cookbook , so we know that these recipes have been tried and tested . what 's most gratifying is the listing at the end of the book of food sources for mju - london lags nyc in terms of high-end food stores such as dean & amp ; deluca and citarella , so the list is very useful , and it allows me to dream about learning to cook at the level of a master like tetsuya
this cd is excellent . it 's a soulful mix of jazz , hip hop , and r & b . kajmere is a distribution company on the west coast turning out indiesoul , hip hop , dance , and indierock . they typically turn out <NUM> '' releases - most of these cuts are from these releases . and , this is exactly how this music sounds to me - underground , like hidden treasure - each track . from adriana evans ' `` remember the love '' , to n8e 's `` tread lightly '' and `` rock on '' , to all of dj tonks ' tracks , to presto and lowd 's `` back in <NUM> '' , to `` love '' by the globetroddas , this cd is an outstanding soulful representation of where i hope music continues to go . buy it - you wo n't be disappointed .
i really like al stewart 's style - he has an easygoing , yet catchy style that is definately his own . he 's a little like gerry rafferty , a little bit beatle-esque and a tad bit like bob dylan , but he 's got his own great style . this compilation is very good , it hits all the high points and has excellent sound . my favorite songs of his were always `` the year of the cat '' and `` time passages '' , but all of the songs are very good and listenable . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes good folk/soft/pop rock
to everyone that was n't feelin daz on `` tha dogg pound gangsta lp '' ( including me ) -- this album has a completely different sound . the title is kinda lame , but it duz spell out what this album is all about . when daz left cali for the south , it seemed as if he finally sold out ... this could not be further from the truth . `` gangsta crunk '' is <NUM> timez more gangsta and on-point than anything that has come out of the west for the last few years . daz crushes the game and snoop with this release , even outdoing his classic debut , `` retaliation , revenge , and get back . '' do n't let the title fool you -- '' gangsta crunk '' does n't feature any dumbazz lil-jon type hooks , only bombazz beats & hardcore lyrics . the best cutz are `` i 'm looking for dat gangsta bit * h , '' `` a license to kill , '' `` we mean bizniz , '' and `` tow up from tha flo ' up '' -- the latter two both being classics . props to daz for turning his career around ; ca n't wait for the dogg pound reunion album
another vote for boss guitar for the best wes montgomery record of all time . these remastered series are limited , and the sound is so much better than the regular cd that you wont believe it . this is essential listening
sam intrator has collected a diverse sampling of stories from teachers of all types . they inspire and inform and are enjoyable to read . i would strongly recommend this book for anyone who teaches , from preschool to graduate school
a great selection of italo-dance songs with some other good songs as the upper tracks . overall a wonderful cd
this is a great book to read so that you can skip the <NUM> boring ones before it and save yourself some agony . this gives a wonderful , detailed history of the never-before revealed story of magician humphrey while briefly reminding you about all the books before this one . i 'd recommend it if you 're looking to get alot of books read in just on
to watch ! doris day is so funny and good at her job . too bad there is n't anyone else out there who could keep up with her these days . typical boy chases girl movie and i love it when he catches her
you have to put in some time but this book gives you all the tools you need to draw well . i can already see my progress after a few hours . highly recommend this book
by the way , the 'tumblin ' tumbleweed ' version is by 'roy rogers & sons of the pioneers ' , not 'riders in the sky
this book is so great it will never see the bookshelf . as a first time mom , with my mom across the us , this book came in handy a lot . i started to read this before my baby was born , and learned stuff i never even knew . afterwards it came handy as a refrence , especially when my baby got sick ( which was a lot ) . this book is great for any first time mom as a shower gift
everyone remembers the <NUM> series where dr. richard kimble ( david janssen ) goes running around in every episode just missing the criminal that killed his wife . he in turn is being chased by lt. philip gerard ( barry morse ) who thinks kimble did it and is a fugitive from the law . the whole thing was narrated by william conrad . well now we have the movie . this time we have a beginning middle and ending all in <NUM> minutes . dr. richard kimble ( harrison ford ) and his wife helen ( sela ward ) are the perfect couple . then one night while he was working for some inexplicable reason a despicable person dispatches helen . on her way to the netherworld she inadvertently says richard on the <NUM> call . one thing leads to another and kimble gets the blame . in the process of transporting him from one containment system to another the transport meets with a little accident ; now kimble is free to find locate the real perpetrator . now it is up to marshal samuel gerard ( tommy lee jones ) to find and retrieve kimble . now that we have covered the basic there is not where to begin to tell how great this movie is on many levels . the anticipation of the chase of kimble to find the perpetrator ( by the way he has only one arm ) before gerard catches him . we get close and have a few read herrings . tommy lee gets to keep his stoic look as he says things like `` i do n't care . '' and `` i do n't bargain . '' personaly i think that the chicago police knew all along who the real bad guy was and was covering for him several times right up to the end . they went out of there way to paint kimble as the bad guy . detective rosetti ( joseph f. kosala ) also tried to stop him from revealing the real perpetrator . rosetti referring to kimball even after the truth is revealed `` he 's going down . you wo n't help us , you stay the hell out ! ''
old fashioned political/spy thriller from the cold war era . head and shoulders above bruce willis '90s re-make without the over the top violence and weaponry . somewhat dated , but characters are well defined and beleivable and the single shot rifle disguised as a crutch , i want one ! . this jackal is cold-blodded , ruthless and real
this is the best instructional pilates dvd ! i really like the fact that sarah has a section that shows you the basic moves and principles before you start the exercises . as a beginner , this allowed me to go back and make sure i was doing things correctly . it is a great work out and i know this is a dvd i will continue to use
first a few words about myself so you can more easily judge if my opinion might be helpful to you or not . i teach power vinyasa yoga at a local hotel spa fitness club . i train every day and prefer complete power yoga flow routines that challange your overall bodystrength a lot and still contribute to every aspect of yoga ( meaning the meditative aspects , proper breathing , inner awareness and so on ) . since i 'm german my english spelling is pretty bad , sorry for that ! about the dvd : the routine is about <NUM> minutes long but still offers you quite a challange for the short time . i ca n't do <NUM> to <NUM> minutes of yoga every day , so i 'm glad to own a couple of shorter programms for the days in between or for early in the morning . rodney yee is a hihgly skilled instructor with a very gentil and calm manner and an interesting style of yoga . his voice is always soothing , but still encouraging . the programm on the dvd is specially challanging for upper body strength but still working the whole body . it 's fluid and , regarding the short time , complete . the only one little thing i can critizise is that the verbal instruction is somtimes not absolutly in line with the instruction on screen . from time to time rodny on screen is movin just a little to fast compared to his verbal instruction . but that 's not very important and does n't cause any problems , so i can still rate this <NUM> stars . if your looking for a short physicaly demanding power yoga routine , this is for you . it 's not suitable for absolute beginners since rodny moves pretty fast from pose to pose and some are to challanging for an absolute beginner . i would recommend it for intermediate to advanced students . if your interested in more power yoga , check out my other reviews about power vinyasa yoga dvds . to see al dvds i recommend check out my listmania list . let my know if you found the reviews helpfull . i truely hope so ! namast
longesome crowded west just somehow works . everyone should have a listen ! polar opposites is my favorite song of all time .
this is a tremendously informative and well written book . short and to the point and in a language that anybody can understand , it should be required reading for anyone vaguely interested in the economic future of america and , indeed , the whole world . mr. brown 's book is not a populist war cry but a sensible and well reasoned debunking of all the `` free trade '' rhetoric one normally hears . one warning : this book may well leave the reader angry with the status quo !
great book , could n't put it down until i finished it ! if you like the history of how a great race car was born and how three special guy 's , wilbur shaw , ted horn and cotton henning made the masarati 8ctf a legend , get this book ! this car was a winner in 1939-40 , should have won in <NUM> , and finished no worse than 4th from <NUM> to <NUM> . it was still competing in the <NUM> until <NUM>
naturally any film media can not place the entire book on the screen with maybe the exception of `` hamlet '' ( <NUM> ) . with anything less than a mini-series . second is it the story or the philosophy that needs to be transmitted ? if you are lucky you get both . in this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie . an added plus , you could say double plus good , was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version . the story `` <NUM> '' was envisioned in <NUM> . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - in a society that has eliminated many imbalances , surplus goods , and even class struggle , there are bound to be deviates ; winston smith ( john hurt ) is one of those . he starts out , due to his inability to doublethink , with thoughtcrime . this is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed . eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex ( suzanna hamilton ) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member ( richard burton ) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan . if he gets caught , he will be sent to the `` ministry of love '' where they have a record of <NUM> % cures for this sort of insanity . they will even forgive his past indiscretions . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - this version is a little more graphic than the other two earlier commercial movies . however each movie version brings a different emphasis on this classic story . there is a <NUM> version in the works read a review of the book `` <NUM> '' by george orwell . the movie can stand on its own merit , but knowledge of the book will help fill in the gaps and explain the inferences . better actors could not have been picked . richard burton is in his element . many people think this is happening today .
the previews for this film caught my attention , so i rented it as soon as it came out . it was a very interesting and thought provoking film . how would three people with different languages and different cultures interact , especially if two of them are enemies ? this film explores that question . the performances were outstanding , and the film was beautifully and artisticly done . much of it was very funny , as the audience is let in on both what was being said and what was thought to be being said . one example of this is ivan being called gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling veiko to get lost . even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating . while this film is rated pg-13 , parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it ( i would n't ) . this is because of some issues of religion and morality ( to say more would give to many plot spoilers ) .
for kirsty cotton ( ashley laurence ) , the nightmares never end . still fresh in her fevered memory of her father 's skinned corpse , the evil machinations of her uncle frank 's reanimated body and the unspeakable perversity of the cenobites . but the worst is yet to come . from beyond the outer darkness , from the darkest regions of the imagination comes hellbound : hellraiser ii . do n't bother with the other hell raisers their just plain crap & boring
i enjoyed this film very much . it strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet . how many can identify with the lead character david , obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years , a fellow named theo . what gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting , devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters . in an ironic twist , his best friend , theo , played by john simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy . unfortunately , simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have no chemistry , thus making their relationship implausible . if it is true that gay people look for `` looks in a person first '' rather than personality , then this movie proves that this is a myth . i liked the fact that david , who could have any man he wanted ( because he is the good looking one ) saw beyond theo 's average looks and felt a genuine , albeit , obsessive and unhealthy love for him . one sympathizes with david because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend , and then hear the details afterward . again , how many gay people have ever been in this situation ? it is a common occurrence in the gay community . another implausibility is the `` coming out on a talk show '' with a near `` jenny jones '' type of fiasco at the end with theo nearly beating david to a pulp until his girlfriend , who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing david . one ca n't believe that theo would have that much violence and hated toward david , no matter what drove david to break up the relationship between theo and the girlfriend . john simm ( theo ) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack . the film ends with david serenely contended in a lush , green park , free at last . free from hiding , yes , but free from his love for theo ? i think not . the film was , indeed , realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society . however , the end result is that , in my opinion , one is not entirely convinced that theo would abandon david in such a violent way . not after being taken care of and defended by david for fourteen years . thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played david , this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable , despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for theo . this film is worth a look .
being on a beach in the days of george hamilton 's golden tan ! great movi
do n't get it wrong this movie is not about the million man march . this is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst african-american men . this movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs , and how this affects unity amongst african-american men and women . i like how spike lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers . the documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work
a fan of mr. d 's for many years and appreciating his uniqueness and sense of humor always shown in his music . track # <NUM> down in mexico is a song not to be missed with anyone with ears muchless a fan . saw delbert perform it live on 2/14/06 in lex ky the best sound i 've ever heard in concert ; any genre . this cd offers subtle surprises and big smiles . pashaswife
this book is a great reference for architecture students and architects . it shows in great detail drawing types and explains the uses for each of the types . it is also very helpful at the beginning with explaining the tools for drawing and their uses . i would recommend this book to anyone ; it is a great tool for anyone in the field of design
i thought this movie was a oscar winner ! nothing changed but the voices ! but who cares , the show was cancelled ! i also love the plot . even though the beginning was boring . beside the fact that botan got zapped by lighting ! also that they added more characters , i thought that was awesome ! overall it was great ! ! ! !
if you do n't know much about ancient greek history or culture , this is the best short book i know of . on every page , in every sentence , the author gets straight to the point , with no fancy obfuscations , assuming no prior knowledge . i 've never seen a better organized history of ancient greece . besides that , i strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines . he gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction -- just a little bit more than `` what you 're supposed to know . '' some teachers i know prefer a book titled `` ancient greece '' written by a team of authors led by sarah pomeroy . it has just a bit more depth than this book , but it is n't nearly as well written . it seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible , but i 'm not sure they succeeded . it does have the advantage of a little more depth , but if you 're reading for pleasure , i recommend this one rather than that one . it is , though , only an introduction ; that 's the obvious downside of being short . you might want more information about the culture : more excerpts from the poets , the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail , more plates ( or plates in color ) about the art . actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white . but of course a book dedicated to greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects , and that would be a book worth reading . this one serves only as an introduction . i strongly recommend reading the norton critical editions of the iliad and odyssey , hesiod , a couple famous tragedies ( in my opinion , euripides ' medea is the one to read first ) , and a few of plato 's more famous dialogues . that is an introduction ; but if that 's the kind of thing you intend to do , this book will be a great place to start . on the historical/political/social matters , this book is again a great introduction , but only an introduction . if you want more detailed information , especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened , i very strongly recommend john v. a . fine 's `` the ancient greeks , '' one of the very best history books i 've ever read . of course it 's a lot longer , but it 's worth it . once again , if you 're reading for pleasure , i recommend this one first , and then fine 's book , which is a bit harder to follow . if you want to read about greek religion , i would once again start here ; but then you should read the classic , walter burkert 's book , and follow it up with jan bremmer 's book , both titled `` greek religion . '' of course , why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient greece ? since the renaissance and even more since the victorian era , anyone in the west who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient greece . they were certainly very influential on western culture , and via bactria even had some considerable influence on east asia . i 've found that greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern european or american history . i think it 's because of the nature of the ancient greeks themselves , because they reflected on human nature via their own history , so as we study ancient greece , we get to reflect on the nature of power , why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies , why wars are won or lost , why empires rise and fall , how much blood and misery flow through history , and so on . students do n't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas , but they get to reflect about life , why the world is the way it is , for themselves . and that is what most people , young or old , are all about .
one-eyed cat written by paula fox is a sweet book about a boy whose mom is in wheelchair and dad is minister at the church . ned the boy receives a share of trouble throughout the book . i enjoyed this book because it is interesting within the book about rivers , and animals . i disliked the book because it started out so slow in the beginning and rest of the book . i also disliked the book because the characters are dull and there is n't much rising action and major conflict so it is not as exciting as other books . i also liked it because of it 's setting of different places by the hudson river . this is a good book , i suggest reading it . good reading for all ages . dylan p. creston , california

soulful , smooth , distinctive ... paul taylor is one of my favs on the jazz scene . he did n't disappoint with pleasure seeker , it will forever be apart of my collection
there is something strange and primative about the beats laid down by kimbrough and his band . a view into what the blues may have sounded like <NUM> years ago , but amp'ed up . it 's tough to pull yourself away from this sound . liner notes by robert palmer are also great . if you are looking for soemthing different , but great , check out this album
it continues to amaze me to find `` new '' musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country . everyone was amazed when craig chaquico pulled this off , roger takes it to the next level . the closest event i can recall to this release is steely dan 's <NUM> `` ca n't buy a thrill '' that put pop/rock on its ear . the influences are many and varied ... beach boys , beatles , osmonds , neil sedaka , jimmy webb , the who , styx , yes , chicago , alan parsons , elo/jeff lynn , astrud giberto , wondermints , burt bacharach , supertramp , <NUM> 's brit pop , the list goes on ... as for roger 's vocal ability , he 's no bocelli , but he is better than <NUM> % of the front men out there . he has a unique `` honey '' styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days ( think joseph williams , david pack , donnie osmond , gerry beckley ) . he does n't try to imitate anyone , and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained . primarily a keyboardist , his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well . ca n't think of enough good things to say about this artist . not every cut is excellent , but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive . the three deleted cuts from solid state warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top <NUM> ... during some point of time . buy this cd now
i just want to put it out there ... audra mcdonald is an absolute genious . everything she touches turns to gold , and i just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record . this may not be the audra that we are used to , but if you listen closely she 's near by . so this cd is a little less difficult vocally . so what ? my favorite quality of ms. mcdonald 's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing . she could record twinkle twinkle little star and i would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story . so if you buy this cd , listen to it more than once . let it grow on you . let audra do her thang children . let her do her thang .
it is a good movie for young elementary students . it was very good
gid tanner is a legendary old-time fiddler , so much so that old-time fans are frequently seen wearing t-shirts that say `` gid is my co-pilot '' . the old-time style here is , to discerning ears , quite different than the more common `` round peak '' style , made most famous by fiddler tommy jarrell , and quite obviously different than , say , ozark fiddling . none of the styles are any better or worse , just different , and serious old-time fans will enjoy picking apart the nuances of styles . more casual old-time fans will enjoy this record as well , though , for both the excellent repertoire and top-notch musicianship . if you think o brother where art thou is the real deal , i suggest picking this up and having a listen
i love these practices ! they go so well with the longer yoga conditioning for weight loss . the a.m practice is my particular favorite , it really gets me going , i do it almost everyday , in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon . if i 'm particulary rushed , i might repeat the a.m. practice , i like it so much . the p.m is pretty good , too ; i get to sleep quicker when i do it .
this is a must buy book ! ! ! a classic in every sense of the word . ms. mitford did a wonderful job when the work was originally published and the `` revisited '' portions are great too . as a casket distributor , i have a fairly unique perspective on the funeral business . funeral directors provide a very necessary service to society and are worthy of our praise for their work . that being said , some of their practices are manipulative at best . for example , i sell caskets directly to the public , and even though it is a consumers right to purchase this item directly from an independent casket retailer , funeral homes try their best to steer consumers toward their own highly marked up products . ms. mitford breaks the whole process down in an informative and entertaining manner . i think you will enjoy her work . my website www.sacredvessel.com has some great consumer protection related information if you are looking for additional resources . best wishes for your journey

my first introduction to donald fagen , was his `` new frontier '' video on mtv , which was in heavy rotation in <NUM> . brillant video that accurately protrayed the story related in a great song . ( a special thanks to all the people who have posted the `` new frontier '' video on you tube . ) i loved the song and the video . years later with `` new frontier '' stuck in my head on a constant mental replay track , i bought `` the nightfly '' , and was amazed by how brillant the album was . the first shock was hearing `` i.g.y-international geophysical year '' , which i still hear on the radio , but never knew it was donald fagen . this is the first song on the album , followed by more wonderful songs . it 's a concept album , with the theme of the atomic age/new frontier movement of the late <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's . it captures both the optimism of new technology leading the way , with the underlying hint of fear , that some of this atomic age technology might be the end of the world . the pop culture references in some of the songs are wonderful , as they help convey the feeling of that time . the song `` new frontier '' has several references-actress tuesday weld from `` the many lives of dolby gillis '' and jazz great brubeck are mentioned in it . as far as concept albums go , i would put this up there with pink floyds `` the wall '' or `` dark side of the moon '' . it is much closer to `` dark side '' musically . the best thing about `` the nightfly '' is it 's mellow , with catchy hooks and grooving rhythms . it 's great to listen both actively to hear the stories convenved in the songs , but also works if you just want nice background music . some of songs are also fun for dancing too . i can listen to this entire album from start to finish , happy with every song on it . it 's a rare for an artist to be able to put out an album like that . i 'd love to see the videos made for this album released on dvd
does anyone know about if the second page of the lyrics book is supposed to have writing on it ? i was looking through it and it looks as though somone actualy wrote in the golden box on the second page of my lyrics book . its writen in a blue sparkly pen . was wondering if utada herself wrote it , cus it dose n't look like a computer did it . anyway it says shishunki in kanji wich means puberty basicaly . i got the album in japan on a trip this week . just wondering if anybody had any insite . thanks . oh and yah this album rocks . shes my favorite jp artist
tinkling piano and romantic songs turn the intimate ella into a smokey , late night affair . a very specific , slightly dour , yet beautiful recording . not your typical ella
another masterpiece from donaldson . pick it up and read it .... if you like it try out his other books . the story of angus and morn continues , even more gripping and well developed than in the first book . like the real story , there is bleakness and desolation , but they only serve to highlight the characters . the extremes that they are forced to experience shape them and make them believable as individuals , and make this book very dramatic and powerful . you are brought to understand and care about the characters , and by the end you will find yourself looking on to the next book . after reading this book i went out and bought the rest of the series .... i had no fears about being disappointed by any of the books , and i was n't . two other people in my family were hooked on this series as well , once i showed it to them ( they almost strangled me for losing the third book : )
my 3-year-old daughter loves max & ruby . the somewhat patient big sister , ruby , spends her time with friends and bunny scouts , while her little brother , max , spends his time finding ways to cause mischief . based on books by rosemary wells , these short stories are fun , sweet , and gentle viewing for small children . the dvds have an auto-play function , which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child . the show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than <NUM> seconds or so . when the episodes are all played out , it goes back to the menu and restarts . while tv/dvds should not be used as alternatives to good parenting , the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home . i highly recommend `` max & ruby '' of any title . they are all wonderful . [ my husband even gets a kick out of max 's antics . ] -c.w
i read this book when it first came out in paperback and have since read most of the others . the reason for my recent purchase of the book was for a friend who enjoyed reading it and has since purchased book <NUM> . all the vampire chronicle books i have read i have enjoyed and would recommend them to anyone interested in reading these types of books

i 'm going to review the <NUM> judas priest cds from 1974-1990 except the two live cds first . i am a huge priest fan . i first got into judas priest <NUM> years ago and have stayed loyal to them ever since . this may limit my objectivity since these reviews will really be comparing the different cds to one another not to other bands . there is no bad judas priest cd , only less consistent ones . judas priest is a band that have repeatedly experimented stylistically . some of these experiments were more successful than others . there are cds that are much heavier than others . i will try and bring all these factors into my reviews as well as attempting to summarize the general consensus among hardcore priest fans about each individual release . judas priest are possibly the most important act in metal history and they are certainly metal 's most unwavering proponents . they helped invent heavy metal music , helped refine and perfect it , helped popularize it and have remained `` defenders of the faith '' during metal 's darkest hours , while other `` metal '' acts ran for the hills . they are a legendary band whose role in popular music can not be overstated . if a metal band was not heavily influenced by judas priest directly , then they were heavily influenced by another band that was . their reach is inescapable . judas priest are led by rob halford , one of metal 's most recognizable icons and possibly the greatest vocalist the genre has ever known . halford 's unearthly delivery and range are as responsible as anything else for judas priest 's signature sound . judas priest were not the first band to employ the services of two lead guitarists but they were certainly the first to fully implement them . glenn tipton and k.k . downing are both phenomenal lead soloists but it 's their riffs and songwriting that have made judas priest one of the greatest guitar bands of all time . both are criminally underrated in the guitar world but downing is even underrated among priest fans . bassist ian hill rounds out the band . a founding member along with downing , hill is responsible for keeping the rhythm section humming along through priest 's many drummer changes . hill is not a flashy player but is certainly competent and on the rare occasions the band 's songwriting allows him to shine , he never disappoints . if this is the worst cd judas priest ever recorded with the first halford/tipton/downing/hill ( and it may be ) then that 's quite a compliment because this is a stellar debut . clearly , judas priest were still experimenting with their sound and trying to find their direction with this release . that being said , you can already hear the genesis of a fantastic songwriting collaboration which would make magic for the next three decades and counting . tipton and downing were already experimenting with integrating two guitars and their accompanying parts into a song . `` rocka rolla '' is probably their least heavy cd . it is also like many other judas priest cds in that it has it 's own fairly unique sound in their catalogue . overall , you will often find yourself asking whether this is truly a metal cd at all . in my opinion , this is the only judas priest cd that is true of . some of the best tracks off their second cd , `` sad wings of destiny '' were reportedly left off this cd and that , combined with the mediocre production quality , makes you wonder how truly great this could have been . track listing - `` one for the road '' - this slower-paced blues rocker starts off the album on a poor note . it certainly is n't a bad song . it 's just a little uninspired and it probably is the worst song offered here . it almost certainly was a poor choice to lead off the album . `` rocka rolla '' - right off the bat , track <NUM> on their debut album , this is probably one of judas priest 's all-time great songs . this is a fine , early example of a judas priest trademark , where each guitar and the bass are all playing their own riff . the magical combination of the galloping rhythm section , the sinister guitar lines and halford 's vocals really crystallizes here . there is perfectly placed harmonica at the close of the bridge section at the end of the guitar solo . this is a fantastic song , perhaps only slightly hampered by lukewarm lyrics . `` winter - deep freeze - winter retreat '' - i consider these three songs to actually be one continuous song and i consider `` cheater '' to be seperate altogether . if nothing else , these songs are connected thematically while not being bound by musical motif . `` winter '' starts things off well , immediately suggesting the chill of autumn 's demise with a grinding guitar sound effect and echoing , ethereal vocals by halford . pretty good . fairly heavy . this part comprises the bulk of the trilogy , both being longest in duration and carrying the most emotional impact . `` deep freeze '' is downing ( not tipton as another reviewer suggested ) playing some tremolo lines through distorted sound effects . downing himself has said he does n't like this but i do . it does what it 's supposed to , suggesting a chill so cold that words ca n't describe . it effectively makes the transition from `` winter '' to `` winter retreat '' . even if you do n't like it , it does n't last too long . admittedly , a lot of people seem to dislike it . `` winter retreat '' is a very light , short song . halford 's voice is literally beautiful here and the lyrics suggest the time for optimism has arrived . which of course is why it makes no real sense ( possible irony ? ) to connect this with ... `` cheater '' - great blues-metal riff opens this song about revenge against a woman who has done our narrator wrong ( and the guy she did it with too ... ) . perhaps the dark lyrical tone of this song would suggest to the observant the heavy musical days to come . a fantastic song overall with more strangely perfect harmonica work by halford and highlighted by a fantastic guitar solo . i ca n't be sure but i believe the solo is downing . glenn would go on to play too many of the solos later in the band 's career and this solo would appear to be evidence of that . tipton seems to be a technically superior player and certainly tends to play faster solos , highlighted by a lot of pentatonics , hammer-ons , pull-offs , and finger tapping . downing often plays a more soulful solo and he tends to use way more tremolo than tipton . of course , they 're at their best when they trade off and play off of one another , highlighting each other 's strengths . `` never satisfied '' - pretty good song featuring more phenomenal vocals by halford , especially the final wail . unfortunately , it 's a weak spot , both because of the fairly lame lyrics and because the main riff , already used too repetitively , sounds too similar to the bridge . al atkins removal from the band seems to have benefitted judas priest in two ways . halford sings circles around him and his removal as a lyricist had to have helped that area as well . `` run of the mill '' - clocking in at 8:33 , one of judas priest 's longest songs . one of their least metal . also , definitely one of the most interesting lyrically of their entire career . the song deals with a person who has failed to reach their potential and has become a failure . this is a great song with some very soulful guitar work . superlatives escape me to describe halford 's devastatingly poignant vocals . listen closely to hear a great bass line hiding under all that guitar . `` dying to meet you '' - schizophrenic song that starts off with a rare bass intro from ian hill and a slower pace overall . the song tells the story of a soldier preparing for battle and then entering combat . halford 's vocal range is put to the test here as he sings the first part of the song about as low and deep as you 'll ever hear him . about midway through the songs picks up speed , the guitars take center stage and halford 's vocal delivery gets much higher pitched . lyrically , this is the part of the song where the fighting starts . the tone of the song seems a little derisive of the soldier himself , perhaps topically reflecting many people 's attitudes about the vietnam conflict , which of course was winding down at the time . personally , i disagree with this view but judas priest are almost entirely an apolitical band for better or for worse so i can forgive these very trivial differences of opinion . `` caviar and meths '' - a two minute instrumental closes the cd out . i think it 's fantastic . wordlessly sad . it 's a tragedy that this was originally an eight minute long song with lyrics . i 'd love to hear the full version but it 's probably lost forever . i do n't consider `` diamonds and rust '' , priest 's cover of the joan baez masterpiece a song from this cd . i consider it a part of `` sin after sin '' , their third cd and will talk about it there . i believe the two versions of the song to be the same version with each being produced differently . amazon users consider this 10th out of <NUM> of judas priest 's 1974-1990 cds . i consider it dead last . that being said , it 's still a great album . it 's just not a great introduction to the band as a whole and a lot of fans of the heavier side of priest may not like this album . curious listeners should get `` screaming for vengeance '' . it 's not priest 's best but it 's their best selling and possibly their most generally accessible and most indicative of what priest generally sound like
the movie is n't your typical american hero type war movie . like the characters that develop through the movie
david burton ( richard chamberlain ) is a well respected lawyer and family man living and practicing in sydney , australia . of occidental origin and anglican faith , david has never been one overly concerned with the intangible , unexplainable mysteries of life . however his predictable , concrete world has recently been disrupted by a series of vivid and disturbing dreams that have called into question the very nature of reality . unable to sleep for fear of more night visions he buries himself in his work . his stepfather , reverend burton ( frederick parslow ) , notices the change in david 's demeanor during a weekend visit with the family and questions his stepson on the matter . david confides in him with the statement , `` i 'm having bad dreams . '' as a conversation ensues david is reminded of a series of repetitive nightmares he had as a child . he would awaken in the morning to tell his parents that taxicab drivers came to him in dreams and took him on long drives during the night . that 's why he was always tired in the morning . despite the ongoing dreams and a serious lack of sleep life must go on . he is assigned his first homicide case , he is to defend a group of aborigines in what appears to be a tribal ritual murder . the night before he is to meet his new clients he is visited by a young aborigine in another vivid dream . the unidentified man is holding a triangular rock containing some cryptic carvings and symbols . he stretches out his arm towards david as though offering him the stone . this dream unexpectedly and dramatically takes human form the next day when he meets chris lee ( david gulpilil ) , one of the murder suspects . chris just happens to be the aborigine in his dream . david invites the young man to his home for dinner in an attempt to discover the truth not only about the murder case , but the meaning of dreams . when chris arrives for dinner that evening he is not alone . he has brought charlie ( nandjiwarra amagula ) , an aborginal `` clever man '' or shaman ( who earns a living in the city as a taxicab driver ) . thus is the beginning of a journey into a reality that western civilization has all but forgotten about . this is the `` the dreamtime '' a separate but equally valid stream of consciousness existing alongside our waking world . david is soon to discover that his dreams are inexplicably connected to this archaic world and he is about to play an important role in either the continuation or destruction of both worlds . in my estimation this is without question director peter weirs ' signature film . he has captured on film something i would n't have thought possible , giving us a brief but illuminating firsthand glimpse into the very heart of aboriginal shamanism . the conversation concerning the 'nature of dreams ' between david , chris and charlie is one of the most fascinating and mesmerizing mystical moments in cinematic history . richard chamberlain is perfect in the role of david burton . his ability to express his inner turmoil and fear of the unknown with the absolute minimal amount of dialogue or gesture attests to just how accomplished an actor he is . david gulpilil ( walkabout , crocodile dundee & rabbit-proof fence ) is also the undisputed best choice for the part of chris , providing a most striking contrast with richard chamberlain in both worldview and physical appearance . however the real star of the film is nandjiwarra amagula . this of course is the ultimate in typecasting because nandjiwarra is in fact an authentic aboriginal shaman . truly a man of immense spiritual and physical magnetism , his mere presence on camera is capable of evoking the dreamtime experience . if you have ever had the desire to pursue the shamanic path look deeply into the countenance of nandjiwarra before you decide . those eyes will tell you everything you need to know
fumon tanaka sensei 's mastery of kobudo , iaijutsu , and jujitsu is well articulated in this excellent work . the writing is much clearer than many asian master 's first works in english . the layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text . content includes budo ( martial arts ) history , jujutsu , kenjutsu , and samurai tradition . the nito-ken ( two-sword ) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts . basic , intermediate , and advanced honmon enshin ryu applications are well laid out , with many okuden ( secret ) mastry level techniques portrayed . the focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari ( spear ) , naginata ( halberd ) , bo ( staff ) , and shuriken ( throwing star ) as well . there is also a bit of muto dori ( no sword ) techniques covered as well . the author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively . tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since <NUM> , achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo , 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo , 5th dan in bojutsu , and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments . while you can not learn any martial art solely from a book , this work is an excellent place to learn about these systems or augment your dojo training . highly recommended ! lawrence kane author of surviving armed assaults , the way of kata , and martial arts instructio

i saw the preview of this cartoon on netflix . seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach ( minus daria , who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions ) , i knew i had to buy this . and i love it ! `` is it fall yet ? '' deals with the main characters ' experiences during summer vacation . the highlight : `` the tom thing '' -as trent lane , jane 's musician brother , nicely puts it . daria and tom have fallen in love , and are dating . tom and jane have broken up . this situation dents the friendship of daria and jane . the two bonus episodes on the dvd ( `` fire '' and `` dye ! dye , my darling ! '' ) show how `` the tom thing '' happened . it 's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes first as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of daria , jane and tom that is carried over into the movie . adding to daria 's anguish , her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the ` ok-to-cry corral ' summer camp . working with her are her teachers , dorky mr. o'neill and anthony demartino ( with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he 's very irritated ) . the other ` daria ' characters have their own situations . lovelorn jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that 's out of lawndale . dim-witted lovers kevin and brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool . they only have eyes for each other ... and i wo n't go further than that . watch the movie , and see for yourselves ! daria 's spoiled brat sister quinn and her ` fashion club ' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their psat exams . ( how i remember my high school days ! i was a junior when i took my psat exam - and passed it ! ) lead ` fashion club ' member sandi ( with the deep voice ) reminds me so much of khan from mike judge 's `` king of the hill '' series . like khan , sandi is often sullen-expressioned , and complains a lot ! mack and jodie also have their share of the ` summertime blues ' . mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor , in a truck , and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream . his girlfriend jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office , and is up to her neck in work . the pair does n't have time to date . i love the opening 'beach ' number with the ` daria ' cast frolicking on the beach ... and with daria not participating , of course . it is reminiscent of the `` beach blanket '' <NUM> 's movies with frankie avalon and annette funicello . jane , too , is seen isolated on another part of the beach , painting . her isolation gives proof of her rift with daria . the song `` turn the sun down '' , sung by the female band splendora ( who provide the theme song for ` daria ' ) , is playfully catchy ! splendora sounds like the female version of the beach boys . the 'beach ' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk , with the frolickers still dancing ... followed , in a dissolve , by the `` daria '' logo in a similar 'dusk ' color , with the film 's title ; and splendora 's melodic singing as the song concludes . this is a nice effect . another nice effect is in the dvd 's main menu , with a scene taken from the opening of the ` daria ' t.v . series . a somber daria is at the movies . her fellow moviegoers , surrounding her , are laughing at the scenes from the opening ` beach ' segment . `` turn the sun down '' is played in the background . at the film 's end , there are ` outtakes ' , which are cute and amusing involving the ` daria ' cast . there are a few gross outtakes also included . `` is it fall yet ? '' got me interested in the `` daria '' t.v . series . to admit , daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on beavis and butt-head '' . i purchased her `` daria diaries '' and `` daria databases '' books to help me get to know the lawndale characters . i 'm presently reading her ` diaries ' . and i , too , hope that the complete `` daria '' series gets released on dvd in the very near future . but treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at lawndale with `` is it fall yet ? '' and savor daria 's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes . a little girl in the film asks camp counselor daria `` do you ever smile ? ? '' the answer is yes ! and this movie is sure to make you smile . it 's a gem in the `` daria '' series !

the road to serfdom is a book that you see recommended on many reading lists , and for good reason . hayek shows the reader , from many different directions , why socialism is doomed to failure . he carefully explains why socialism in its pure form leads , inevitably , to totalitarianism . hayek 's illustrations and explanations are quite clear . i found myself somewhat challenged by hayek 's writing style . make no mistake , this can be a somewhat difficult book to read . keep in mind though , that it is a book that should be read a little at a time and pondered upon . the first chapter seemed to be the most difficult . if you can make it through the first chapter , then you are home free . in the end , i was fascinated by this book . hayek 's ability to see in <NUM> what became apparent only many years later to most of his contemporaries , is remarkable . even though this is no easy read , its more than worth the effort .
i possibly watched hundreds of movies , and this one is surely one of the most delighful movies i have ever seen . i watched it with my dog sultan , and he loved it as much as i did . the story is interesting and amuzing , the characters simply adorable . it touches your heart , pleases your senses , and relaxes your mind . could you ask for more ? i would recommend this movie to everyone of all ages . you could see it again and again and it wo n't tire on you because there is real joy at its core . it aims to share this joy with you , and it could n't do a better job . bravo ! !
the first cd is <NUM> stars . it has great continuity that carries over from track to track . the combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you do n't feel burnt out by one or the other . one of the cooler parts about the first cd is tracks such as under the sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels . there is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system . normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels , but a few songs selected by armin goes against this trend . these days there is a lot of good electronic music out there , but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment . all the songs armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous . the second cd is <NUM> stars . it does n't have the energy and momentum that cd1 has and there are n't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats . armin could probably have introduced more variety into cd2 such as breakbeat , house , and tribal , but it is what it is .
if mel brooks was into old kung fu movies instead of old westerns , this would be the result .
this warts and all is much better than warts and all volume one .. the highlights include a <NUM> minute version of kids , a very good timmy tucker and some other extended jams which were good as hel
having absorbed the third season , it 's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically . in this season , apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes , the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises : grissom 's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made ; katherine 's personal life undergoes a tragic change ; warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation ; sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement ; nick takes up a dangerous new hobby ; and brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self . we get dwarves , stand up comics , vigilantes , murderous actors and more . the cast as always is impeccable with william petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television . brilliant show just keeps getting better
barrymore and fallon work well together in this sports nut romantic comedy . one of the better ones i 've seen in a while . a good dvd transfer and some funny extras make this a good buy
louis ' uncle mcallister lives in scotland and every year sends louis the best birthday present . and this year was no different , a tadpole , louis names alphonse . but it soon becomes apparent that alphonse is not your normal , everyday tadpole and definitely not turning into a frog . he soon outgrows his jar , then the kitchen sink , and bathtub . louis sneaks him into the school swimming pool during summer vacation , and that works out just fine until fall when school opens . in a panic louis consults miss seevers , the librarian . librarians always have all the answers , and miss seevers does n't let him down . with a phone call to scotland , a little research , and a lot of ingenuity , louis and miss severs find a clever solution and happily-ever-after ending to their problem ..... first published twenty-five years ago , steven kellogg 's creative classic , the mysterious tadpole , is as fresh and entertaining today as it was back in <NUM> . mr kellogg has given his new illustrations a bold and bright facelift , and tweaked the text a bit , but the engaging and fun-filled story with its hilarious twist at the end , is still sure to capture the imagination and warm your heart . perfect for youngsters 3-7 , the mysterious tadpole is a timeless treasure to share with friends and family now , and future generations in the years to come
jared ( paul walker ) and sam ( jessica alba ) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the bahamas waiting for that day when they 'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems . when jared 's old friend bryce ( scott caan ) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship zephyr . unfortunately , the zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying <NUM> kilos of cocaine ... cocaine its owner ( james frain ) wants back . into the blue has great acting , good directing , great special effects , and good writing . let me start off with saying i definitely prefer paul walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves i 'm right . the acting in this film has got to be its strongest point jessica alba does another great job in her third movie of <NUM> and paul walker does a great job as well . scoot cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk ! the special effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff . the writing and directing were also very good but i believe the acting stood out the most . overall if you like jessica alba or paul walker or underwater adventures you 'll love this movi
this was a brilliant book . the language was much shorter and more precise than in road to serfdom . i know that it was one of hayek 's traits to not use mathematics , but it would have been nice if he demonstrated some of his ideas with at least a little math . or gave us the references if we wanted to look them up right at the bottom of the page . particularly neat was his off-setting things that were not critical to the argument in small type . as it stands , the book is almost <NUM> % empirical evidence of why socialism does n't work . and kudos to the author for calling socialism and communism what they are , which is religion
straight to the point . . . .there are a lot of mixed reviews here , but i would say that this movie is a really good film . now , i 'm in to the quirky , eye-catching , think you ca n't stomach what is going on with this film kinda movies that have young up and coming actors/actresses in it . bijou philips can always be spotted in most of the films , that 's how you know it might fit the mold . anyway , if you are n't into the crazy larry clark films such as `` kids '' and `` bully '' , or any movies such as that , then this probably wo n't interest you a bit . oh , and to that reviewer at the top . . . megzi i believe their name was . . . .mischa barton who is great in the film , she does n't throw on a fake english accent in the movie . . . she really is from london . . . do your research first
i remain firmly in agreement with my good friends , who wrote the critique below . the very best of catron 's texts , this book inspires immediate enthusiasm and , therefore , interaction with the author . i 'll hang onto my original hardcover copy until it turns to dust , and continue to use it while both writing and teaching . an inspired text
i have n't seen this movie , but i am very happy that finally another hal hartley film hsd come on dvd , i just ordered it today , and i sure hope that later other hal hartley films come out on dvd , i will later send a letter to sony pictures to realese it
this film is an artfully crafted vision of the old west . by any measure one of john wayne 's better movies . i really ca n't feature this movie being made with anyone else in the lead . he fits the character like a glove as a tough gnarled and aging rancher . roscoe brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook . his was a oscar caliber performance . in my book , this picture has bruce dern 's best performance as an evil doer . his psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel . and despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it 's concept- cowboys herding cattle that are really boys , facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can . casting the cowboys they used a mix of hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills . this worked out incredibly well . the script is tight and the movie does not have one flabby moment . to top it off- the musical score is by john williams . all of these things converge to create a perfect gem of filmmaking .
the first season of seaview was the best and season <NUM> , volume <NUM> has some of the series best episodes . mutiny , doomsday , the invaders , the indestructible man , the buccaneer , the human computer , the saboteur , cradle of the deep , and the enemies are top-notch . i 've always loved seaview 's incredible monsters and mutiny 's giant jellyfish is a sight to behold . the threat of nuclear war is realistically portrayed in doomsday . i still get shivers up and down my spine when robert duvall opens his eyes in the invaders and when the robot stalks patterson and kowalski in the indestructible man . only seaview would have an episode about someone bold enough to steal the mona lisa . this story ( the buccaneer ) works because the villian is believable ( a touch gay by today 's standards but that 's why the story works ) and the relationships between the crew members are emphasized . in the human computer , seaview is controlled by a computer that 's supposed to replace the crew . star trek did a similar story but seaview 's is better because only crane and an enemy agent are on board and the sight of these <NUM> men stalking each other on the deserted sub have great impact . by far the best episode for me is the enemies . with it 's crazy cold war politics , crane and nelson against the bad guys , and that wonderful room where people on one side seem gigantic compared to those on the other side , how could this episode miss . as always , the special effects , the black and white photography , and paul sawtell 's wonderful theme make seaview one old series that 's worth visiting over and over again
a very successful introduction to picasso 's work and life ! whether you just want to admire his paintings or try to learn from him , this book is a good choice . some people do n't understand picasso and are insulted by astronomic prices of his `` childish '' looking paintings . in this book ingo f. walther sheds light on the phenomenon of this genius by presenting all the phases of painter 's development that naturally resulted in the spontaneous expressions of his imagery . or with the artist 's words : `` when i was as old as these children , i could draw like raphael . but it took me a lifetime to learn to draw like them ! '' thus we can follow picasso from his youth , blue and rose periods to his invention of cubism and all the way to his late works . in addition there are chapters on his sculptures , posters and ceramics . the book also gives a rich selection of interesting aspects of picasso 's life . an enormous publicity was haunting him as well as helping him test his brave inventions . whatever he touched turned to gold . when he finally grew tired of publicity and decided to move from paris to a provincial village of m√©nerbes , he was given a chalet in exchange for a still life .
after hearing this cd for the first time , i knew i wanted to buy it . i also bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been thanking me ever since
its just one of those movies you like to have in your library and i love good old classic cartoon movies . such a fun movie to watch and enjoy with the family
everything good you 've heard about this movie is probaly true . its plot is undeniably good , the way its shot and done are awsome probaly the best ending ever . the scenes arnt as bad as somem people make them out to be but there still bad , the man comminting all of the seven deadly sins is a great actor and makes you think when hes in the car tlaking about why he does them , it puts that in a way he 's right ( he could do it a little less ruthlessly ) but it definatly is worht every penny you spend for it and its one of the best to add to your collection
wow what a great dvd ! i liked the show segmets the best and it was a big help planing our vacation , i never knew that there was so much to do in las vegas now . i thought the program flowed well and had a really good chaper index to quickly review the parts we wanted to see again . this looked just like someting you would see on the travel channel
who said you need a lot of songs on a cd to have a good record ? ? ? this has already got <NUM> thrashy metal songs from one of metal 's finest ! if you are new to slayer , i recommend getting all their early stuff first - or even just that
this soundtrack is as good as the movie . the standout tracks are know the ledge , uptown anthem , and its goin down . this is a classic in everyway . a mix of rap/r & b , and east/west . you cant go wrong with this . my only gripe is a track or two from the movie is'nt on here . kill a man by cypress hill
`` tootsie '' holds a place on both the american film institute 's top <NUM> movies ( # <NUM> ) and the american film institute 's top <NUM> comedies ( # <NUM> ) . oddly enough , on the latter list it 's directly below `` some like it hot '' and both films have simalar subjects . ironically , both subjects are some of the most stereotypical ones . comedies come out every year involving men dressing as women for some purpose ; only some films pull it off with dignity and real heartfelt humor , though , which is why i think tootsie is so popular . michael dorsey ( dustin hoffman , in a wonderful performance ) is a down on his luck actor . he 's been living in new york city trying to make it for twenty years and nothing 's happening . one day his agent ( played by the films director sydney pollack ) explains to michael that no one wants to work with him . taking matters into his own hands , michael dresses as a woman and adapts a higher voice and becomes dorothy michaels ; michael , under his new guise , auditions for a soap opera and wins the role ... and acclaim . at the same time , he falls in love with julie ( jessica lange , who won an oscar for the role ) who is dating the director ( dabney coleman ) . meanwhile , michael manages to neglect a potential girlfriend ( teri garr ) and freak out his roommate jeff ( bill murray , who 's hilarious as always ) . in retrospect , you 've seen this film thousands of times ... while i was n't alive the year the film came out , i ca n't say this is the originator of this storyline , but it is one of the best films to evolve from that storyline . dustin hoffman , who is almost always good , is great in the dual role ( although his five o'clock shadow can be seen under the makeup in several scenes ) . lange is beautiful and wonderful in the role . this is a great movie , if you have n't seen it ... well ... see it . grade :
once in awhile a new collection of stories by a single author comes along that grabs the reader and forces him to take notice . karl wagner 's posthamous & quot ; exorisms and ecstasies & quot ; was one and harlan ellison 's & quot ; love ai n't nothing but sex mispelled & quot ; was another . norman partridge comes along and takes us for a spin along a gravel track with motor 's spiting fire and both carbs blazing . this is a major contender for a world fantasy award , produced by night shade books with a real cloth binding , a killer cover painting and an attention do detail that will leave you breathless . this collection offers <NUM> stories from partridge that turned this reader into an instant fan . be warned , if your idea of literature is a safe escape from the mundane world , do n't get this book . nothing is safe about it , it will grab you , hit you low and hard - but you wo n't look back and nothing will ever be safe again
the book came in a short amont of time and was in the condition specified in the sell
when a film is a horror/epic/monster/romance/martial arts/period film ... what is not to like ? if genre-bending films upset you then you wo n't like it . this movie is for everyone with an open mind . `` brotherhood of the wolf '' takes you places , and it 's directed and acted very well . great action , acting , and special effects . i like to keep my reviews on the shorter side , and this one is no different ... check it out it is worth the money .
this is a great dvd , alot of xtra feature.i think of all make up effex this is the best + love the soundtrack ! ! of all versions out their this is the one you should buy . get city of the living dead and the beyond will your their , you wont be disapointed ! ! lucie fulci , we miss you
i 've always loved pete tong and his essential mixes . then came this movie about the days long gone . movie was awesome and so is this album . every song has it 's value . day and night
this is a movie that stands on it 's own without being a remake . like the 'dawn of the dead ' movie in early <NUM> , this is kind of like a retelling of sorts ; the key plotline generally remains the same , but there are some nice changes and unexpected turns as well . i thought the acting overall was really good ; ermey was def . the best surprise here , and the movie had a very sleek look to it that actually complimented it 's content . the same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake , and there are some very nice nods to the original ; the part w/leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me .. but make no mistake : this movie is brutal in it 's violence , and there is alot of it . and while not really 'scary ' ( except for sheriff hoyt ... yikes ! ! ! ) , this is one intense , horrific ride . the comment on the box read `` if you want horror ... this is horror ! ! '' . for once the box speaks the truth . plus jessica biel spends the whole movie is a semi-revealing tank top , so that never hurts as far as i 'm concerned ..
this is one of those bluegrass albums . you cant be without , i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all . bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music . and i know alot about ricky skaggs , from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky 's sister at a studio once ... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you 'll be glad you did
my brother saw hopesfall perform one of their first shows back in <NUM> . he told me about how amazing they were , so i tracked down frailty of words and bought it online . i had all but stopped listening to hardcore before the first night i listened to the dts release . just like a lot of independent music , my first listen was a confused and almost disappointing one . but then i listened to it again . now , nearly five years later , this is still my favorite cd of all time . i listen to all kinds of music too . i 'm not a die hard metalcore/hardcore fan by any stretch of the imagination . these guys are blessed . even though the original members have all gone their seperate ways for the most part , i still support and buy every album that this band comes out with . now , let me get to no wings to speak of . just as enjoyable as their first album , and slightly more progressive . if you want to here some outstanding music , buy this ep . trust me , for fans of hardcore , this is cutting edge pure emotion spilled out over sound waves . it will change your perception forever . everyone rants about end of an era . it 's absolutely <NUM> % as good as people say , but every song on here is equally impressive . this is the fullest sounding , most emotionally driven , heart pounding , deep and intense music i 've heard maybe ever . if you do n't buy this cd , you are cheating yourself big time . if you like hopesfall , i strongly recommend 7angels 7plagues , misery signals , evergreen terrace , between the buried and me , prayer for cleansing . all these bands deliver much passionate hardcore , but you just ca n't compare them to hopesfall . they are in a leauge all their own . and just one more thing . what is it about north carolina that so many of these awesome bands come from there ? i dunno
i am not a big tesla fan but this is a great album . i think what hurt them is that they were categorized with the all the goofy hair metal bands but they were more in the vein of your classic <NUM> 's style rock and roll band . this live album , along with the accoustic format , helped to distinguish tesla from the hair metal bands of the era . tesla did not do much after this cd so this acts as an excellent greatest hits compilation as well . besides their own work , the covers are good and interesting selections . they do not just play `` truckin '' , rather they segue into it . `` lodi '' is done very well and then the song that essentially launched the cd , as well as the band , is `` signs '' . they take this marginal <NUM> 's era protest song and put their stamp of it . it still maintains a protest aura to it but the accoustic treatment makes it grittier and it rocks out harder . tesla made the song their own ! as far as the accoustic format , the song `` love song '' showcases the musicianship of the band . i like how they could not resist plugging in for the guitar solo . overall , you do not have to be a fan of this band to enjoy this cd . if you like any classic rock led zep , ccr , thin lizzy , deep purple , aerosmith etc . then you will like this . like i said , i am not a big fan but b/c of this cd , i would see them live any day !
our family has enjoyed listening to this very much , we received it just in time for st. patrick 's day
this is one of my favorite books on entertaining . i love all of martha 's stuff and this one is one of my favorites . anyone considering entertaining on any scale should pick this up and read it !
this is compulsory reading for anyone who has been touched by breast cancer . it provides a perspective that supports patient , family and friends . it transcends medical application and bridges generations
this is a beautiful , sensitive film that addresses issues both spritual and secular , and it manages to do it all with amazing humor ! it 's a movie you 'll want to watch again and again and share with friends and family
i can not help but laugh every time i see people bashing each other over a movie . disliking a certain film is one thing . but for somebody to go out of their way and flagrantly insult a total stranger over their enjoyment of a particular film they happened to hate is unnecessary and immature . amazon should police these reviews a bit more seriously . `` critters '' is a fond and harmless throwback to the sort of monster movie so prevalent in the mid-1950s sci-fi boom . i can not so easily classify the plot as straight-up horror , because it really is n't . this is more of a hodgepodge . you get a smattering of horror , comedy , and science fiction all rolled up within a singular and satisfying package . i caught this in a theater with my father twenty years ago , and it has always remained a guilty pleasure of mine . none of the special effects are overdone , the writing is suitable , and i found most of the cast agreeable and entertaining . i have found over the years that many of us tend to take our movies way too seriously . in the end , i could really care less that `` critters '' does n't follow the rules of reality . because , when i pay to see movies like this , reality is something i want to escape from .
after black moon dropped `` enta da stage '' in <NUM> , people knew about boot camp was about . then <NUM> years later in <NUM> , smif n wessun came up with a classic debut album ! this is the second album to come out of the boot camp clik . if you thought black moons `` enta da stage '' was classic , then you have to pick this up now ! ! the lyrics on this album are on point all the way through . words about life on the streets , fakes , and just all that hood and real hip-hop ! lyric wise , youll feel the same type of lyrics like those from black moons debut album . they wont dissapoint ! the production on this album deserves these words ... insanely dope ! if you heard black moons first album , you knew that `` da beatminerz '' were on about every track , youll find the same thing here ! da beatminerz are back for more dope beatmaking ! i do n't think there is one weak beat on this album , you got those heavy bass , and just straight bangers ! to sum it up , just like me tell you this . if you like boot camp , black moon , heltah skeltah or any of it , or good hip-hop , do not ... i repeat .. do not pass up picking up this album ! its dope ! ! ! ! my top <NUM> songs 1.wrektime 2.wontime 3.bucktown 4.cession at da doghillee 5.wrekoniz
hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character , against all the indiana joneses and bruce lees of the world . difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character , against all the draculas and frankensteins who did the reverse trip . they had to bring some kind of english fabula into the picture , accent , tea and everything else , plus a touch of cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of siberian whitish russianism . and it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some arabian astrology than anything from another constellation . but it does not really matter . lara croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent . and it works as much as we can hope , and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her english mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate . we recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely british clive barker , but that might have been an illusion . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris i pantheon-sorbonne

nominated for <NUM> golden globes and <NUM> emmys , including <NUM> for outstanding drama series , er has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television . premiering in september <NUM> on nbc , the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across america . brought into being by michael crichton - famous hollywood insider , novelist , and brains behind such films as jurassic park , twister , and timeline - er fulfills its creator 's ultimate vision ( it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit ) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the er . since its inception , many cast members have passed through the halls of er , many of them having gone on to become big stars in hollywood ... er follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy chicago hospital . the show attempts to examine every detail of the er experience . from the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork , all the highs and lows are covered . in the show 's first year , a number of regular faces staffed the er . doctors mark greene ( anthony edwards ) , peter benton ( eriq la salle ) , douglas ross ( george clooney ) , and susan lewis ( sherri stringfield ) were regulars in the er along with head nurse carol hathaway ( julianna margulies ) and benton 's medical student understudy ( and later er doctor ) , john carter ( noah wyle ) ... any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show , interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere . the show 's high drama , coupled with subplots of the staffers ' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology , combine to make er one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history ... the er ( season <NUM> ) dvd features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere `` welcome back , carter ! '' in which carter arrives late for his new position in the er while mark gets comfortable in his new position among the senior staff . meanwhile , the er tries to patch up the victims of a rival gang war , and new medical school students arrive in the er for their rotations ... other notable episodes from season <NUM> include `` hell and high water '' in which doug happens upon a young boy trapped in a drain pipe rapidly filling with water , and `` a shift in the night '' in which mark is forced to carry the load of the er by himself when doug is out with whiplash and susan is out on business ... below is a list of episodes included on the er ( season <NUM> ) dvd : episode <NUM> ( welcome back , carter ! ) episode <NUM> ( summer run ) episode <NUM> ( do one , teach one , kill one ) episode <NUM> ( what life ? ) episode <NUM> ( and baby makes two ) episode <NUM> ( days like this ) episode <NUM> ( hell and high water ) episode <NUM> ( the secret sharer ) episode <NUM> ( home ) episode <NUM> ( a miracle happens here ) episode <NUM> ( dead of winter ) episode <NUM> ( true lies ) episode <NUM> ( it 's not easy being greene ) episode <NUM> ( the right thing ) episode <NUM> ( baby shower ) episode <NUM> ( the healers ) episode <NUM> ( the match game ) episode <NUM> ( a shift in the night ) episode <NUM> ( fire in the belly ) episode <NUM> ( fevers of unknown origin ) episode <NUM> ( take these broken wings ) episode <NUM> ( john carter , m.d . ) the dvd repor
a down and dirty mel gibson is fantastic in this film . from his gravely voice , and the lack of a single smile throughout the film , he plays the part perfectly . porter is a man betrayed by his wife , his friend , and left for dead . the entire movie involves him trying to get the money that was stolen from him back . that proves to be not as simple as it seems , and soon corrupt cops , the mob , and japanese gangsters are all out for him . this one is worth the money
intriguing historical account of macnamara- what he was thinking , what he did not say during two administrations involved in the viet name war . use of film footage and philip glass ' eerie and ominous soundtrack further developed the power of this film
this is a great guide that every woman should own . it not only tells and explains how to have orgasms , but also tells you about how to enhance them . i liked the author 's honest , straight-forward approach . the details were too detailed or mundane , either , which made it a quick , easy read . definitely recommended to all women , along with `` good sex , a woman 's guide '' and `` supersex ''
how do you know when a production in the music business is awsome ? because more than <NUM> years from its release , people still write and talk about it . progressive house , house , deep house . this cd is a must have for every person who likes music regardless the type of music . global underground <NUM> - danny tenaglia - athens does represent what electronic music is all about . if i were to pick up a few cds for another culture ( martians ) and let them know what ours is about , this would be one of the ones i would pick
having lived in the author 's home for two years while in new york i am biased towards this niche masterpiece . although my interests are on opposite sides of the map in relation to this book i had the privilege to witness , first hand , the author 's diligence and perseverence in putting the finishing touches on his textual opus . in this book mr. gauch brings his statistical mastery with him in his endeavor to reconcile science , philosophy and religion in the public arena . in so doing he greatly enables scientists to become better at what they do by examining the foundations of the scientific method . this book is a must read for students of science and scientific professionals alike
when i decided to teach myself how to work with wire ( especially wrapping cabs and other decorative work ) , i bought several books , and this one is definitely the best for learning . the illustrations are clear and easy to understand ( important for me since i 'm a visual learner ) , and the text is informative and easy to read ( though not dumbed-down ) . i 've done several of the projects so far and had no trouble ( aside from my own general lack of dexterity ) completing each of them , with attractive results . the other books just did n't work for me to get started , though i might be able to use them better now that i really understand the basics . if you already have the basic skills , you wo n't need this , but if you want to learn , start here
dj kid koala is probably one of the better djs today , in standards of both technique and creativity . his skill allows him to take basically every quote he would like and to mix it into the flow . texts and sounds as one , he manages to make it appear like a new , whole piece - which is exactly what a true dj supposed to do . by redefining the art of turntables , he has in this specific album all that 's needed - a bit of dark tracks , a bit of laughable samples ; and all in all , if you like the genre , this album is a must
armaggedon , gone in <NUM> seconds , enemy of the state , deep blue sea , american outlaws , national treasure . most of these scores are good but all too electonic . rabin restrains himself from using any electronic instrument on this score . from the get-go , the score sounds like a mix of saving private ryan for the main theme and a hint of the thin red line for the subtle moments . its a well done mixture . `` the rescue '' starts off much like the saving private ryan ending with a patriotic brass section . the song greatly displays rabin 's departure from his more recent scores . another good track featuring the brassy theme in its entirety is `` the great raid '' . the complete theme is not heard on the movie but at least we get it on the album . there is only one action song and two tense songs . `` raid begins '' is action . `` rangers start '' and `` stealing medicine '' are tense . `` the geat raid '' track is a mixture of both elements since its a bit tense before coming to a tiumphant close to signal the conclusion of the raid . this score is orchestral , a first for rabin making this his most challenging . i recommend this score to all drama score lovers . i also recommend saving private ryan , band of brothers , we were soldiers and the thin red line as well
i enjoyed this album . at first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990 's rock album . but after a good listen , you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album . it 's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound
wow ! this was a pretty decent romantic comedy . we had this in our collection for months ( possibly years ) and never watched it . we decided to watch this film on a whim . i have to say that it was better and ever funnier than i thought it would be . monica potter is great in her role . it 's a sweet movie that actually does n't do to much guy bashing ( the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies ) . i am also a big fam of henry thomas , and he is great at as well . i wo n't go into the plot here , as many others already have . but what i am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres ( sweet home alabama & <NUM> going on <NUM> ) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention . the other thing that must be said is , with virtually no cute romatic female leads under <NUM> ( and over <NUM> ) , why is n't monica potter more famous than she is . she can easily be the next julia roberts , or meg ryan . julia has <NUM> kids and meg has just hit the wall , it 's time for a beauty like monica potter to get into the very lucrative romantic comedy genre . here 's hoping she gets a better agent before it 's to late . cute movie , with a good heart . definetly made a date night at home wonderful . -mark ( for the record 32yrs old , straight and yes i enjoyed this movie )
having owned the videotape of this offering from dr. yang , i was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the dvd . i was very satisfied with the information offered on the vhs tape , but having already owned the material , it did n't make sense to purchase a dvd unless there was something added to the material . generally , when a company releases a dvd of a previously released vhs tape , there is very little added to the dvd release . fortunately , in line with the high quality of ymaa publications , this dvd has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original vhs . combine this with the ease of access that a dvd offers and the taijiquan , classical yang style dvd becomes even more of a bargain . the video offers material and instruction for the following : the taijiquan thirteen postures the fundamental <NUM> stances taiji qigong , with stretching and three sets taught the yang style taijiquan sequence ( the long form ) the video also has an extensive lecture on taijiquan theory by dr. yang as well as a demonstration of fa jing and a list of all the movements of the long form . the lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn taijiquan . merely imitating the postures and movements , which sadly is how many people practice taijiquan , without an understanding of the philosophy from which taijiquan developed , would severely limit one 's experience . dr. yang discusses how taiji is between wuji ( nothingness ) and yin and yang . this concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of taijiquan . when you begin the form , you should stand in a beginning posture which represents wuji , or nothingness/emptiness , during which you settle the body , relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this wuji state . then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the taiji ( which came from the wuji ) splits into the yin and yang . the dead hands and body , maximum yin , become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang , along with the whole body . now the form begins . i see many practitioners walk up , stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from . the transition from wuji to taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of taijiquan . dr. yang points out that taiji , the theory of which is explained so well in this video , has been around for approximately four thousand years , whereas taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years . the use of this theory in daoism is also explained by dr. yang . the link between taijiquan and daoism through their mutual use of the philosophy of taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning taijiquan . dr. yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of taijiquan and the laws of physics . this lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video . too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered . this video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn taijiquan . throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the taijiquan qigong . the demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol . i would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this dvd . a wonderful addition to dr. yang 's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the vhs version of this video .
if you want to check out beth , get this one first - she has since lost the edge ... and also a great guitarist in jimmy ! !
waterfalls are some of the most primitive things in nature . with this cd , you ca n't help but think you 're right there next to the waterfall . close your eyes or lie down , and let the natural sounds permeate your mind
this greatest hits collection is a nice overview of jermaine 's work from the late '70s , through to the early '90s . there are some great upbeat dance tracks along with some slow jams . the only downside to this collection is that it does n't include & quot ; when the rain begins to fall & quot ; , a duet that he did with pia zadora back in 1983/84 . this does n't take away from the other classics like & quot ; do what you do & quot ; , and & quot ; dynamite & quot ; . i seemed to have a few singles of jermaine 's from back in the day , so it 's nice to have his songs on cd to enjoy for a long time . there are other greatest hit collections out there , but i opted for this one because it was released by arista , which was one of <NUM> labels that jermaine was signed with . it sounds clear & amp ; clean , not screechy like some other older recordings converted to cd do . if you like some great r & amp ; b , then jermaine jackson 's & quot ; heritage collection & quot ; will hit the spot
i must admit that initially i did n't want to watch this movie . i 'm not a big brad pitt fan and i viewed this as just another vehicle for brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more . fortunately i changed my mind and gave it and chance and i 'm happy i did . 'troy ' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions , brilliantly directed with a crisp script , stellar cast and memorable soundtrack . brad pitt was perfect for the part of achilles as was eric bana as hector . i would also like to credit peter o'toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as priam , king of troy , diane kruger as the lovely helen and sean bean in the role of king odysseus
i am very satisfied with the item , and it delived so quckly
the movies were shipped quickly , and the dvd 's are of great quality
the first <NUM> lines are : `` what makes iago evil ? some people ask . i never ask . '' which also reeks of facile gum-snapping cynicism . but joan really redeemed herself with the following passage : `` she walked back to the car and sat for a long while in the parking lot , idling the engine and watching a woman in a muumuu walk out of the carolina pines motel and cross the street to a supermarket . the woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight . as if in trance maria watched the woman , for it seemed to her then that she was watching the dead still center of the world , the quintessential intersection of nothing . ''
i have read most of eric j. dickey 's books and this one was a different writing style . it was a great book though . it was interesting and the end was not too easy to figure out . it kept me til the very last page . i do recommend
this cd caught me by surprise with it 's wide range of melodies . the more i listen the more i like it
now this is what i call rocking music . i first heard cheyenne 's `` one original thing '' on the movie , aquamarine , and got hooked on it . i purely bought the cd just for that one song , then found out , there were so many other great ones . `` hanging on '' and `` original thing '' , title track `` day has come '' , `` everything to lose '' , `` mr. beautiful '' , `` four walls '' and `` full circle '' are ones worth listening to over and over again . i never get tired of them . 'hello goodbye ' , 'good go bad ' and 'did n't i ' are growing on me-more and more , `` breaking your heart '' is edgy along with ' i want to ' . this is definitely the type of music to have at a party to dance all night long to , she makes me wan na dance and never stop . this texan is definitely has a lot of potential
professor eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism . focus is placed on postmodernism 's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism 's contribution in the arts and architecture . this , in fact , could well be the subject of an entirely new book , however , aesthetics , in this case , is not eagleton 's main concern . it probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy , postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text , however , someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book ( dictionary in hand ) without too much difficulty . by definition , post modernism is hard to define , as it claims no foundational tenets : it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy . as eagleton writes , `` it is animated by the critical spirit , and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions . '' ( p.26 ) from a socio-political standpoint , postmodern theories are part of a culture of `` unmaking '' . it can be characterized as a rejection of all `` metanarratives '' or `` grandnarratives '' ; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the ` canon ' , a snubbing of intellectual elites , a blurring between high and low art , where bart simpson sits comfortably with shakespeare . i would characterize it as a cynical `` anti '' position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society . the key principles of all postmodern theories include : `` ... decreation , disintergration , deconstruction , decentrement , displacement , difference , discontinuity , disappearance , demoralization and delegitimation . '' ( post modern theory , best , kellner , <NUM> ) in one respect , eagleton applauds postmodernism 's huge body of work over a short time , and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions , though , criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories . there is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as derrida , lyotard or kristiva , but after wading through their dense and at times `` cult-like '' prose , one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism , realising that these theories are empty rhetoric , that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie , a `` grand-narrative '' to keep us chained . for the most part eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of marxism and socialism , and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism 's na ? ve , almost adolescent view of the present world situation . he concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present . that there are many possible futures , including fascism : how would postmodern theory shape to such a future ? in my opinion , not too well . this book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory .
at a rather hip friend 's insistence , i first heard this album in mid to late high school ( circa <NUM> ) . seeing as that those years were ground zero for teenage angst and all that comes with being hormonal , confused , and lovelorn , i seized onto this band with a fervor ( right along with mineral , seam , and a few others ) . to this day , when i hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song , i instinctively grit my teeth , get my rock face on , and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel . this is a powerful record , one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout . the desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in titr 's music , but it 's bound tight with melody , memorable time signatures , and pop-savvy structures . granted , garrett 's voice can drive people away from the band if they are n't willing to give it time ( he 's more than a tad nasal ) , but the songs stick with you . definitely an album to purchase if you 're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90 's tail end of the `` emo/post hardcore '' movement . as for the guy who suggested that the ep was better than this full-length , do n't believe it . get this , and dig in
i heard many mixed opinions about this dvd but i 'm glad that i finally decided to buy one for myself . lang lang 's fingers are like flying upon the piano . his facial expression may seem distracting but i take it nothing more than an artist 's expression of his own enjoyment in the music . great music ! not to be missed . i do hope to see more of his dvds coming .
well here i am again best , better , bueno what could i say
of all of tupac 's post death material , this is probably my favourite album . though some may complain that the songs were not as pac intended , i think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part , the updated production is great . most will already have heard the singles `` letter <NUM> my unborn '' and `` until the end of time '' , both are great , and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles . other notable tracks are `` this aint livin '' which is probably the best track on here , `` breathin '' , `` everything they owe '' , `` lastonesleft '' , `` m.o.b '' and `` world wide mob figgaz '' . in fact most of the tracks on here are at least good . it goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material pac produced while alive , after all these are his throw away songs . just goes to show what a genius pac was , that these are songs he did n't consider good enough for his albums , they put most other rappers a tracks to shame . i give it <NUM> stars because there are a few filler tracks and the outlawz are just on here too much . while i have a load of respect for the outlawz for staying true to pac , i just do n't rate their rapping skills too highly . anyway an amazing album , especially considering pac had been dead for <NUM> years when this was released . r.i.p tupac
not only the legal status but the personal outlooks of women changed immeasurably in the period this book covers ; the subtitle speaks of space and power , but deutsch has also given us a fine overview of intellectual change : what women thought , and why they thought in those ways , during an era of astonishing industrial and social development . through her research , we can see why the women of henry james were not the same as those of f. scott fitzgerald -- and they were very different . we are used to sympathizing with the plight of working class women , and giving great credit to the founders of the settlement houses and political groups that helped them , but until now i had never realized how class differences affected attitudes , and how perfectly reasonable women of either set found great difficulty in understanding how those of the other thought and felt . this book has helped me get a better understanding of both groups . in recent months i 've been reading heavily in boston history and in women 's history of this period . this book is far and away the best thing i 've found . having done historical research using primary sources , i can tell you this author has done an immense amount of work , and it has paid off . she uses not only the minutes of meetings and legal reports , but personal letters and contemporary novels to tell the story . she writes clearly , and the book is well organized . if you want a real feel for the lives of women during a period of tremendous change , this book is the best place i know to get it . deutsch straightens out a lot of misconceptions , and helps to clarify an extremely complex period .
to everyone who is in search of a song from the movie go to this link for a scene by scene song list : http : //imdb.com/title/tt0286499/board/nest/224815 i hope this helps
i loved all three chapters of this dvd , as well as poirot set <NUM> . the menu is easy to use , the quality of the picture is incredible , etc . the only thing i missed , where the subtitles in spanish . i speak fluently english , so that was not a problem . so , if you are going to buy this dvd and dont know english , dont buy it , unless you want to learn . and the sound is a little soft , so dont forget to turn the volume down when the dvd is over ... hope this was helpful , and have a great day
out of exile , like the debut , rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore . again we see rick rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock . chris cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics . indeed the fact that cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over . lucky for us that they did . this second instalment of the audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing . the riffs are so smooth - who let the <NUM> 's back in ? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff . this album does fell a little mellower overall . not sure if that 's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut . this ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up . sure it 's sales were n't up there with the debut but it 's as consistent as the first album and it 's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that 's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there . in the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along . token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover
`` koma '' is a surprisingly suspenseful film . while there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers a very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story . angelica lee as fung chi-ching , a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend , does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense . as researcher suen ling , karena lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street . the twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $ 60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame . subtitled with chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience . `` koma '' turns out to be a pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !
the aquatics director wanted the atmosphere at our club pool to provide a `` california summer '' feel . the surfin ' sounds of the ventures really hit the spot ... and made me feel young again
ciara does not have a pretty voice . her single `` goodies '' mislead everyone to think the cd was bumping , but that show in the hell was not true . this album has about <NUM> or <NUM> songs that are actually good . the following songs include ... goodies , hotline , oh , lookin ' at u , ooh baby , next to you , and i , other chicks and the title.i gave this album <NUM> stars and it show in the hell do n't deserve it . can i get a witness ! has anyone besides me notice that ciara ca n't dance and sing . everytime she perform this hoochie ca n't hardly breath . i guess they call that asthma ! ciara do me a favor . next time you bring out a cd , you need to breath , stretch , shake and let it go .
for the record i 'm not really a dry kill logic fan per say . i own their first two records and i 've heard all of the new one . i 'd have to say the dead and dreaming is their `` crowning '' effort . now first off , nothing about this band is really original . there were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time dkl came around it was already old . however , the crushing energy and agression can not be ignored . the mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like linkin park-esque vocals . nothing special there . so anyway , if you like your metal loud and angry , but low on the technical and originality scale then dry kill logic is for you . this is their heaviest album and packs a punch . better than limp bizkit , korn , hatebreed and all that mess , but i 'll still stick to my slayer , opeth , and testament albums
some of this is just common sense . but some of this was life changing for my family . the chapters in this book build upon themselves and as they grow they develop the theme of families being worth the effort . there are stories of real life situations , quotes , examples and more . one chapter is about making a plan and making a statement . and while i know this is based on a business type mode , we tried it . we made a family statement and it has been a large part of our lives . my children will recite it and use it as a reminder of what we expect of them . it is a great book . one that will have a place on my bookshelves for many years to come .
this is an excellent book for fish health professionals and students alike . it contains methods for diagnosing fish diseases as well as detailed biology , life history , and the current most effective treatment regimen for each organism . the book covers environmental problems , as well as bacteriology , virology , parasitology , and nutritional deficiencies.it is well written and organized making it a good resource book for the laboratory
that 's all i have to say . plain and simple . dr. thompson 's cds have a made a postive impact on my life so much so that i have gone out and purchased more and more . the delta <NUM> cd has helped me attain sleep quicker and more restful than ever . i prefer the 2nd theta cd for meditation but will listen to the first for more creative mediation and thinking . i am now a devoted fan . and can not say enough about the effectiveness of the good doctor 's work
i hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior . perhaps this was true in previous bindings , but the copy i recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come . i 'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards , though as a beginner i have not put it to lots of use . basically i use the new nelson , with this dictionary as a supplement , especially for compounds . and there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system .
the cast in this recording is absolutely phenomenal , and the music of john bucchino showcases the depth and beauty of his talent . each song is a heartbreak , starting with creel 's stunning `` unexpressed '' to porter 's poignant `` grateful . '' the performances are stunning , and the lyrics so simple yet so enlightening and a perfect complement to bucchino 's sweeping music . the orchestrations are supposed to be simple with only the piano as accompaniment , but that is all this cd needs . these are cabaret songs , and thank goodness this cd has come to showcase the best of bucchino 's work and this talented cast . it would be a travesty not to have this recording . every song is a delight , with my favorites being : unexpressed sweet dreams playbill that smile love quiz a contact high [ ridiculous , but very clever ] it feels like home it 's only life this moment taking the wheel gratefu
outkast has always been an unbelievably creative and experimental group . arising from the south , which is typically plagued with no-talent wannabe-emcees who ca n't seem to keep their platinum teeth off each other 's rectum , they manage to always provide conventional and beautiful music . their dope debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was just a mere introduction to their skills , and would only pave the way for their untouchable classic known as atliens . on this superb sophomore lp , outkast gave us an unbelievable grouping of introspective and thought-provoking music , with their own p-funkish beats . their experimentation only continued on their third album aquemeni , which is yet another superb album . on this one , big boi and andre <NUM> experiment with some new sounds , go for some new creative subject matter , and slow down the tempo on a few notes . their most recent album , <NUM> 's stankonia , showed how dynamic they were , giving us a mix of unbelievable , up-tempo party jams , feel-good music , and of course , the signature introspection . <NUM> promised outkast 's return , and they indeed delivered . firstly , speakerboxx/the love below are two albums packaged as one . speakerboxx is big boi 's album , and the love below is andre <NUM> 's solo effort . each member of outkast basically star on each album and provide their own musical landscapes and styles . they each released a single , one per album , hence making this feel as if it is two different albums , and in fact it is . therefore , for my review , i will review it as two separate albums , to keep the comparisons separate throughout the majority of the review until my conclusion . keep in mind as you read the review , before i begin , that both albums are very different , and i will review this with an open mind and as a true fan of outkast , which i am ... enjoy ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - firstly , i will review big boi 's album speakerboxx . big boi 's disk is loaded with the typical outkast sound , keeping the experimentation level on a minimum . big boi has always been a dope lyricist , so i look forward to listening to this album with high hopes that he has n't fallen off . the guest list looks pretty impressive , including some big mainstream names , and a couple of lesser known names . still , big boi is the star , and he has proven in the past that he can carry the mantle . let 's hope that the same applies here . track list & rating : `` speakerboxx ''

& the east side boyz & mello ( <NUM> 1/2 stars ) <NUM> - bowtie ( postlude ) ( not rated ) big boi 's half of this double album , known as speakerboxx kicks off with a skippable intro , which then leads us into `` ghettomusick '' . the synthesized beat immediately kicks in , making you think that it would be some sort of up-tempo techno track . after a bit of the beat playing , we get some quick , danceable , party music and big boi kicking off a flow . the sound of the song is fast and smooth , perfect for those long high-way drives . big boi sings for the first part , and raps for the latter part . i like to consider this an introductory track , experimenting with techno , r & b , and hip-hop elements . as a sidenote , id like to say that i am a huge fan of experimental music . i love it , which is why i enjoyed the most recent experimental musical albums such as phrenology by the roots and electric circus by common . when classic , well-respected artists decide to cross into new styles of music , its always interesting and fun to me , and those with an open-mind . `` bowtie '' features the southern , p-funkish elements which make outkast who they are . featuring some slamming trumpets , that typical dungeon family singing , and some nice guitars , big boi drops some pretty dope lyrics about a certain female who ca n't seem to get off his mind . the track might seem a bit commercial , but its a pleasure to listen to due to the lyricism of big boi and the dope production done by jazze pha ( who is typically a commercial producer , but has his moments ) . big boi proves on this track that he is indeed still a dope rapper , and has yet to fall off . `` the way you move '' is big boi 's lead single . big boi 's unbelievably creative lyrics adds some nostalgia , taking us back to the groups ' extraordinarily light-hearted work found on aquemeni . the production is one of those pieces that will be stuck in your head for ages to come , with its pounding trumpets . the background r & b/soul vocals only add to the song , giving the song an unforgettable , seductive feeling to it . big boi 's mic presence is unforgettable , and this is an ideal lead single for big boi . killer mike joins big boi on `` bust '' . the melodic production is dope , and the background vocals are reminiscent of some of the silly singing found on d-12 's debut devil 's night . killer mike and big boi drop ill introspective verses , reminiscing about the past . the production is , as expected , loud and pounding , but also melodic and listenable . immediately with the first listen , you can tell this is an outkast track , and a damn good one at that . `` church '' has the incredible makings of a classic , but is shut down by seemingly annoying and overabusive production . the subject matter revolves around big boi questioning his religion due to the problems surrounding not only himself , but the entire world . big boi mixes introspection with some creativity and heart , backed by some thought-provoking lyrics . lyrically and subject-matter-wise , this track is dope , but the production and organization needs a lot of work . as i said earlier , youve got to have an open musical mind and be a fan of true hip-hop lyricism and elements in order to fully appreciate the experimental sounds found on speakerboxx . skipping ahead we arrive at `` flip flop rock '' . a commercial jay-z joins killer mike and big boi on this dope introspective collaborative crew joint . big boi touches on street violence , racism , and oppression that is seemingly killing the blacks of this country , as well as the other kids in the streets . big boi 's introspective lyrics and political views are interesting , and add a new twist to those who doubted how ill of an emcee he is . the melodic hook is one of those dope ones , but soon jay-z appears on the track and gives us some egotistical , somewhat materialistic lyrics . i dont understand all of the hype over jay-z 's black album due to the fact that jay-z is nowhere near showing me that he is going to change , and turn underground again . his verse on this song is very commercial , and leads me to believe that his so-called `` final '' album might just be a repeat of other washouts he 's had in the past . i sure hope not ... because the heads deserve a lot more . its interesting that the dungeon family themselves provide the first true classic on speakerboxx , that being `` reset '' . cee-lo and khujo goodie from goodie mob join up with big boi to give us the dopest song on big boi 's disc . the slow-tempo production and haunting background vocals provide an amazing atmosphere , and a somewhat nostalgic trip back to the days of the classic atliens , where outkast gave us a classic-filled album of this caliber . big boi , cee-lo and khujo drop some memorably dope introspective verses , touches on the evils of the world from government , to racists , to life itself . the overall feel of the track is unbelievable , as it is a true classic . speakerboxx is nowhere near being as good as any of the previous outkast albums by themselves . its obvious to me that big boi fits a lot better with andre <NUM> than without him . this album , unlike his partner 's disc , stays true to hip-hop and retains the traditional outkast sound for most of the tracks , along with a few new soundscapes and experimental sounds . this album incorporates lots of guests , but the majority do a great job and manage to keep up with big boi . a lot of the songs are bangers , and it stays at a great level of quality , but nowhere near the classics that they have put out in the past . however , speakerboxx is a pretty dope stand-alone album with its share of hits and misses . 3.75 stars -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - moving on , we now arrive to andre <NUM> 's somewhat solo effort , known as the love below . this is about as farfetched as andre has ever gone in his career . experimentation and eclectic music is the name of the game here , as andre gives us some unique musical landscapes , touching on every single musical style thinkable , from jazz , to soul , to r & b , to hip-hop , to rock , and beyond . as i said at the beginning of this review , i am a huge fan of experimentation by artists who have already proven themselves , thus i fully respect andre 's decision to explore his creativity as he has done on the love below . staying true to hip-hop is something that i treasure , but andre has proven in the past that he is capable of doing that , so i will review this album on a completely unbiased level . track list & rating : `` the love below ''

up next is andre <NUM> 's lead single , entitled `` hey ya '' . the fast tempo , guitarish beat giving the track an amazing light-hearted feel . however , besides the excellent , fast tempo production , andre <NUM> spits fire with his amazing vocal display . the song has a very mid <NUM> 's sort of quirky feel to it , making it one of those songs that many heads are afraid to admit they enjoy . me ? i love it . the beat is tight , the singing is amazing , and its difficult for you not to enjoy this melodic musical medley . i feel as if andre chose the perfect lead single , just like i felt big boi did on his album . `` roses '' and `` behold a lady '' are eerily similar love songs . both songs feature some seductive , r & b/soul vocals directed to a woman . keeping the familiar outkast p-funk , mixed with new forms of music and nice melodies is something that andre has seemingly perfected the art of doing this merger . the second track of the two is a much more up-tempo track , with a tiny bit more seductiveness to it , and some more appeal . the synthesized melody is different than the last , proving that the only familiar parts would be the seductiveness of the vocals and andre 's choice of subject matter . the love below hits a speed bump with `` pink & blue '' . i appreciate the elceptiveness of the album , as long as it makes sense . what we have here is a cadre of sounds put together in a fast pace , making the song sound like a complete mess , and almost unlistenable . thusfar , this is the only extremely weak moment on either album . skipping ahead past some of the average moments of the love below , we get to the closing track , strangely titled `` a life in the day of benjamin andre '' . believe it or not , andre does something on this track which he has yet to do ... and thats rap ! ! ! ! unbelievably enough , andre ends his disc with what brought him to the fame in the first place . production-wise , its pretty simplistic , with drums , a clap , and some weird background effects . this song feels a lot like something that was pulled from atliens , due to its simple production and song concept . the subject matter is creative as f * ck , as andre uses his `` art of storytelling '' to summarize his entire life into one day . the song has no catchy hook of any sort , but that does n't matter due to the fact that andre gets personal , even touching on his relationship with erykah badu . a fitting close to andre 's disc . the love below is eclectic , unique , and at times just plain bizarre , but its primarily good . the musical variety is shown , and andre 's maturity and growth as an artist is something to give praise about . his disc is filled with mainly good or great songs , and pretty much only one flaw . old-school outkast fans probably wont dig it too much unless they have an open mind , and most likely neither will backpacker heads . however , i truly believe that this is an album not only for hip-hop fans , but for fans of all music respectfully . <NUM> stars -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - in listening to speakerboxx/the love below as a combined album , i often wondered if big boi and andre <NUM> could really separate and keep apart without losing a tad bit of the quality . i mean , lets be honest , they are an unbelievable duo and their different points of view as well as rhyme styles create a wonderful landscape of lyricism and music . apparently , they indeed prove that they can . i honestly had no clue what to expect from this album except that i honestly trust outkast to give us good music , and im glad i did . i always walk into an outkast album with an open mind set , and i always walk out with a smile knowing that they have yet to make a bad album . the question on many fans minds is : which album is better ? well , in my own personal opinion , andre <NUM> 's album is slightly better and much more consistent this time around , and the music is unbelievable . however , big boi 's album is much more true to hip-hop with lyricism and such . my conclusion to this is that i highly appreciate that outkast gave us <NUM> discs this time around , but i believe that they belong together in order to give us the true classics which they are more than capable of . their experimentation is great , and this album will always be treasured by their fans , but i do believe that their part should only be temporary . it was dope how its <NUM> discs for the price of one , and thats even more the reason for me to reccomend speakerboxx/the love below . it is a dope album loaded with stuff to please everybody ... so get yourself a copy as soon as you can . overall rating : <NUM> stars
let 's be honest . sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives , yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly . this movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way . whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not , this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about , and it does it in a way that is quite frankly , non-sensational and non-gratuitous . and you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get ' and enjoy this movie , for it goes much deeper . this is a excellent character study . the film is quite erotic , although very little actual sex is shown . it 's power is in the anticipation and what is not said . it 's about need . as several other reviewers have brought out here , there 's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex . the beauty of the film is in it 's subtlety and the depth of the characters , which the director takes time to develop . both james spader and maggie gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story , which really is a story about 'complements ' . it 's about finding that balance in the energy between two people . there is a silent , powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles . the viewer can really just 'sense ' this dynamic building throughout the film . there is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes . there is so much that is unspoken , yet if you pay attention , you know what is going on . i think it 's great film-making . in an age when we are innundated with quick , flash images every other second , sensational sex and violence for it 's own sake , and a total lack of character development , i find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters , and secretary does that superbly . i also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental , open honesty . after all , in the end , its a love story . a story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation . and really , is n't that what any successful relationship is really about ? the look in lee 's face in the last frame of the movie says it all .
finally , in this day of pc pablum , someone tells the real history of the confederate soldier ! you 'll learn little-known facts about the major players , including general lee of course , but more importantly , this set focuses heavily on the average man in the ranks and why he chose to fight . daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used . the real reasons and motivations for fighting are explored and what life was like after the war when men had to go home in defeat to often-devastated homes . highly recommend ! it 's a must for serious students of the war and anyone who wants an authentic look at the period
i 'm korean .. so ... my english is not very good ... what i really want to say is ..... christian bale is a good player .. i love christian bale .
i 've been a fan of .38 since their first album , and this ranks from first track to last as their best effort in my opinion . don barnes and donnie van zant each lend their distinctive voices to such rockers as 'chained lightning ' and 'back door stranger ' . the guitar work of barnes and jeff carlisi was never better . southern rock at it 's finest ! !
this movie was so beautiful . i watched it with my retarded daughter was immediately loved the character who was retarded . she acted so good . i couldnt believe how touching the end was with all the butterflies
top notch acting through a difficult subject . the loss of hope through capture , torture and betrayal in the face of brutal circumstances is the crucible in which true honor and self sacrifice rise to the surface . this prisoner of war movie , slated to release too close to 9/11 , finally reached the public without fan fare and is one of the most powerful depictions of honor and true humility available today . when some of the prisoners are inspired to teach and study and redeem the time by sharing their gifts and talents , hope finds its way into the hearts of the prisoners once again . they now have something to live for , to look forward to at the end of the work day , and their `` awakening '' causes their captors to permit expansion ( espeacially since their productivity increases ) . ultimately , their honorable ways are admired ( even if privately ) by their enemies , who lack the compassion necessary to be truly honorable themselves
my order came right on time ! just like it said that it would . the book was in excellent condition . it was neatly wrapped and packed for safety . i will shop here again in the near future . j. smith cedar hill , texa
i love sealab <NUM> , it 's an excelent show . i mean it 's probably one of the stupidest shows of all time but it 's just so darn funny . and the bizzaro episode is the best . turtleface rocks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is a very good collection i stumbled across and has the original ( and pretty much best ) versions of all the hits - and i disagree with the last reviewer who cited & quot ; chega de saudade & quot ; as being bad without the lyrics - it 's one of my favorites and is such a perfect tune that it needs no lyrics ! get this album if you are even slightly interested in bossa nova - it has quickly become one of my staples ..
for me , this film was about matt damon , a brilliant newcomer who came out of ( seemingly ) nowhere . i was floored by his performance - one of the best of the 20th century . of course he was supported by a fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , and the loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry with damon was sizzling . matt is an emerald in a heap of cheap diamonds , and obviously a multi-talented guy - he co-wrote the screenplay as well as starred in it . well worth seeing .
george bernard shaw wrote the screenplay based on his own very successful stage play of <NUM> , and he even took an academy award for it - and deservedly so . it 's a crackerjack production , his best on screen . leslie howard plays the overbearing professor higgins and wendy hiller is the cockney flower girl transformed into a `` lady . '' both are perfect , and the whole thing is a lot better than the musical it became ( my fair lady ) . it sparkles throughout , and the shavian jabs at middle class society ( `` marriage - it 's the proper thing , but it 's not natural '' ) are wonderful and are just icing on an already rich cake . definitely worth a watch
i 'm not a civil war expert , but having recently visited fredericksburg , chancellorsville , and gettysburg , i paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books i read . when i came home i watched both gettysburg and gods and generals again , and i must say , the events of these important battles come to life in these dvds . yes , there 's always going to be some interpretation done , but overall i thought the acting was well done and the information reliable . the characters were well developed , as i felt that i got a chance to really know what these men were like . if you want to see history , then i would recommend this and gettysburg as well
+++++ `` what a piece of work is man ! how noble in reason ! how infinite in faculties ! in form and moving , how express and admirable ! in action , how like an angel ! in apprehension , how like a god ! the beauty of the world ! the paragon of animals ! '' the man this program is in search for is the one who wrote the above beautiful words and , as well , wrote many verses and words like it . his name : william shakespeare ( <NUM> to <NUM> ) , `` [ a man ] not of an age , but for all time . '' surprisingly , not much is known of shakespeare 's life , until now . the enthusiastic michael wood takes us on a wonderful trek to discover just who shakespeare was . we learn about such things as follows : his parentage ; his birth ; his times , the politics and religion of the time ; his youth ; his marriage and loves ; his `` lost '' years ; his london years ; his career ; and his plays and sonnets . there are four parts to this program ( originally aired on the public broadcasting station ) . each includes a very brief introduction that i will reproduce here : ( <NUM> ) a time of reformation ( <NUM> scenes including introduction and credits ) `` like all stories in history , this is a search for ghosts . a quest for the people that made us what we are . and for one man in particular . william shakespeare is the most famous writer of all times ... yet his life is still shrouded in mystery ... this is a historical detective story ... searching for the life of william shakespeare of stratford upon the avon . '' this is the only part where wood gives a summary . he says , `` there 's the first nineteen years of shakespeare 's life . [ wood then proceeds with his brief summary ... ] and that 's just the beginning of the story ! '' ( <NUM> ) the lost years ( <NUM> scenes ) `` how did a poor country boy ... become such a celebrity so soon after he arrived in london ? it 's one of the great mysteries of shakespeare 's life ... ten years before shakespeare had been ... in stratford with no job and few prospects . how did he do it ? how did he make that leap ? and what did he do in those ten years ? '' ( <NUM> ) the duty of poets ( <NUM> scenes ) `` in the 1590s the english theatre entered its golden age and for the next twenty years its brightest star was william shakespeare . but back in the early 1590s , shakespeare was one of many gifted young poets . what was it that transformed him in the next few years to the greatest thing anybody had ever seen . what happened to him in his career and his private life ? '' ( <NUM> ) for all time ( <NUM> scenes ) `` for william shakespeare , <NUM> was a very good year . writer , actor , director , he was now the artist and chief of elizabethan theatre . he created some of the greatest characters in literature ... in [ england ] , theatre was n't just entertainment , it was popular and political - it had a thrilling and dangerous power . shakespeare ... is ... in his late thirties ... out of the experience of his life and the turbulent times through which he lived , the new worlds and the lost worlds , he pulls it all together in some of the greatest works of literature ever written . it 's that last story and the mysterious end to his career that we 're going to uncover . '' wood travels extensively to different places , talking and interviewing people . he even reads from the actual historical documents that indicate something about shakespeare , some of it uncovered only recently ! the cinematography is breathtaking . the photography inside actual buildings of shakespeare 's time is fantastic . the background music compliments wood 's narrative . special mention should be given to the royal shakespearean company who travel with wood . they act out bits of not only shakespeare 's plays but other plays of that time ( such as those of his rival , christopher marlowe ) . you 'll hear bits of his plays from each of these categories : the romantic comedies ( example : `` a midsummers night dream '' ) ; the histories ( example : `` henry iv , '' part <NUM> ) ; tragedies ( example : `` macbeth '' ) ; and the tragicomic romances ( example : `` the tempest '' ) . ( there was no example from his `` problem '' plays . ) there is one dvd extra ( about twenty minutes ) that has eight scenes . it is quite good . the dvd 's picture and sound quality were perfect . there were no distracting artifacts . finally , if you 're a william shakespeare fanatic like i am , then you 'll enjoy this program . i learned a lot of new things that i was not aware of before . if you 're a newcomer to shakespeare 's life then i envy you . this program is the best introduction to his life , in my opinion , that there is . in conclusion , be sure to view this program and find out why shakespeare discovered that the duty of poets was `` to speak what we feel and not what we ought to say ! '' ( <NUM> ; <NUM> hours ; <NUM> discs ; made for tv ; wide screen ) +++++
this movie is a classic , u have so many great actors in this movie ... you know , i loved this movie the first time i saw it as a kid and it was better the seccond time ...
very satisfied . usually bible movies are very poor in acting , etc . these were very well produced and had some familiar actors . the movies seemed to stay with the bible
i remember the first time i realized that james baldwin was a genius . i picked up one of angela davis 's autobiographies . i found one of the most beautifully crafted letters ever exchanged from one writer to another . and with one five page letter , i fell in love . i am certain that the price of the ticket must be one of the greatest collections of essays ever bound into a single volume . if someone would like to challenge that , please be my guest . and , i believe that james baldwin is probably the second most widley quoted african american writer in epithets , speeches and dedications after martin luther king . i admit , i have no statistical data to support these claims . i have no quantitative proof . just keep your eyes and ears open and you will understand what i mean . whether it was the text many thousands gone i read in an african history course on slavery , or the article entitled the price of the ticket that i discovered in my art history course . baldwin has left an indelible mark on history . james warned us that , `` it is very nearly impossible , after all , to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind . '' ( the ca n't turn back ) he proved to us that , `` freedom is not something that anybody can be given ; freedom is something people take and people are as free as they want to be . '' ( notes for a hypothetical novel ) long before morrison & cose explanation of the envy of the world we knew , `` alas , that to be an american negro male is also to be a kind of walking phallic symbol : which means that one pays , in one 's own personality , for the sexual insecurity of others . '' ( the black boy looks at the white boy ) before mumia reminded us baldwin informed us , `` what passes for identity in america is a serise of myths about one 's heroic ancestors . it 's astounding to me , for example that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free . '' ( a talk to teachers ) and years later we still have not grasped the fact that , `` guilt is a luxury we can no longer afford . '' ( words of a native son ) perhaps genovese was smiling when baldwin wrote , `` we won our christianity , our faith , at the point of a gun , not because of the example afforded by white christains , but in spite of it . it was very difficult to become a christian if you were a black man on a slave ship , and the slave ship was called `` the good ship jesus . '' perhaps the scarriest thing that baldwin has showed us , is how seldom things change . any writer , i suppose , feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent . talent is not to be ignored . dreams are to be followed , challenges are to be faced and art is to be created .
perfect movie for everyone . no matter how many times i watch the movie it is always funny . whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good .
a lot has already been said about this novel , so i 'll address my review to those unfamiliar with mccarthy 's work . if you 've never read mccarthy before , this is a great place to start . the plot is tight , engaging , and easy to follow , and the language is gorgeous . if you enjoy this book and want to move on to others , read the others in the border trilogy before tackling `` blood meridian . '' some people will take issue with mccarthy 's grammar , sentence structure , use of spanish , and punctuation ( or lack thereof ) . mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing , and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning . the sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and `` breath , '' meaning that they do n't always look or sound like conventional prose . this will be displeasing to some . as an example , the first line of the book reads : `` the candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door . '' now , mccarthy could have just as easily said `` the candle flickered when he entered the room , '' or something like that , but the effect , aurally , is just not the same . read the first page of the book . if you do n't catch fire at the beauty of it , then maybe this book , and mccarthy 's work in general , is not for you
i 'm usually dismissive of most die zauberflotes because i find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking . then i came upon this recording ... i have to say that it is simply the most amazing die zauberflote i 've ever heard ! the orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself ... everything is mind-blowing ! i 'm not a mozart person , but if i really like a recording of his i will buy it . this is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the flute , especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera . and the queen of the night-edda moser ! ! ! amazing ! simply amazing ! no other queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing . this is the flute . i would suggest marriner 's version if i had n't seen this one , but then here is a flute with all the greats in it ! get it now
dirk bogarde is great in this role ! ! role reversal , ( or was it role rectification ?
i went to the movies with the thought that i probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised . i love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles . i am not what you call a beyonce fan , but i found myself enjoying her in this role . i have always loved musicals and ca n't wait to add this one to my collection . my grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs .
as other reviewers have already mentioned , this underated classic is a brilliant combination of film noir & the wild west . the photography is simply amazing . the flashbacks , dreamlike sequences , & one particularly memorable scene in which mitchum 's stepbrother is seen in the background slowly stalking mitchum while planning to shoot him are what make this an incredible western . robert mitchum plays jeb rand , the lone rand family survivor after a bloody feud . rescued & raised by ma callum ( judith anderson ) he grows up with her two kids : thor ( teresa wright ) & adam ( john rodney ) . jeb gets along with thor just great , so great that they fall in love ! this does n't sit well with adam who never accepts jeb as a part of the family . their rivalry only worsens as they grow older , eventually leading to tragic results which tear the family apart . mitchum commands the screen so well with his amazing performance that he makes acting look easy . this is easily his best western & one of his greatest roles of his career . the chemestry between him & teresa wright is one of the best things about this classic . add max steiner 's music & you 've got one awesome film ! and let 's not forget the underated alan hale , who has a small but memorable supporting role as a friend of jeb 's . considered as the first psychological western , this is an unforgettable gem that you need to add to your dvd collection
i personally thought that stomp the yard was a great movie everything about it was great . it so sad to see that people can never give credit where it due . stomp the yard was a good movie i mean what more could you expect from the title . it did remind you of other movies like drumline , you got searved and maybe even step up but you cant look at those and expect to get the same thing out of it or even talk bad on because it wasnt what you wanted to be . to me the movie touched in to a little bit of everything romance , talent history , college and being new to something and showing what you got and also made a point about learning lessons . as far as the comment from betty burks i disagree with everything that was said because all of it was negative my advice would be to grow up and get up to dated we are no longer living in the old days so there was no need to compare the movie to people you felt like have already done things that ewere done in the movie . and the statment about violence come on where was that at i really missed that part and if i didnt and wasnt violence in the movie to state that comment itjust showed how some kids with talent react to certain situations a nick name is something that sticks with you and matches your personality or appearance if you didnt have one ..... that just explains you the dances were more of a updated version of the latest dances the telescope comment wasnt called for amd and the noise you heard that was so loud was called surround sound its located in practically all movie theater please find something positive out of it atleast i give the movie 10starts its a must see film give credit where credit is due ! ! * * * * * * * * *
i love this new cd from amos lee . the first single is entitled shout out loud . this song really puts me in a great mood . his guitar playing is so energetic here . my favorite track is long line of pain though . it is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness . sympathize is an another highlight on this disc . amos lee 's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck . southern girl is amos ' tribute to the charm of a girl from the south . night train is a very pretty love song . skipping stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one . freedom is an interesting track . it is a reminder that the pursuit of freedom should not lead to violence . the lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking . sweet pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special . careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend . i love the feeling of loss and sense of hurt in amos ' voice on this track . supply and demand is a very entertaining cd by a talented young musician and song writer
in the fourth installment in jane lindskold 's ongoing wolf series , the heroine firekeeper , her sentient wolf companuion blind seer , and her friend derian carter have all been kidnapped and taken to a nation called loglimi well south of the locales of their previous adventures . the loglimish are aware of the intelligence of the 'royal beasts ' firekeeper was raised by , and the creatures play an important part in their religion ; so the prospect of being able to establish through firekeeper better communication with the wise beasts is enticing and , at the same time , potentially threatening to many loglimi . as in the opener of the series , firekeeper 's entry into the court , or in this case temple , produces considerable friction . firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the loglimi and their animals ; at the same time ( and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development ) she learns more of her own background . and there are , of course , nefarious plots underway which require the unique talents of firekeeper , blind seer , and derian to defeat them . no time is wasted in setting up the story ; the capture takes place before the first page . as a result , the other continuing characters from the series are n't present at all . but the removal to a new location avoids the feeling of staleness that crept into the previous volume . that makes this the best book in this series since the first
judi dench is so great at this type of comedy . i would have loved to have seen her in something of neil simons . her gift for repartee is impressive . as a long time watcher of `` as time goes by '' i was delighted to find this series . rather bittersweet that it was made with her husband , who she lost after a long and i gather successful marriage
screams & wisphers is another great cd from edwin mccain and his band . the song couldnt love you more is a great song for lovers that have ever had doubters about there love , edwin mccain is in my opinion one of the best singer song writers out , the way he makes you feel the songs and stories with his words is something only true artist can do . not a big radio artist but that keeps him grounded and not caught up in the hollywood sell out that so many of these so called artist give into - a great cd by a great artist and worth twice the price the sticker has on it , nothing edwin mccain puts out is bad , if your a true fan of real music youll love anything edwin mccain puts ou
this band is a great pick-up , especially if you like bands like shinedown or tantric . at times , i wish there was more guitar parts on the album , but its a very solid , safe , and well produced release . nothing ground breaking , but a great listen that will be in my changer for weeks to come
if you 're looking for a faithful adaptation of dracula , this is not it . this is not a movie to be taken seriously . it 's a fun , popcorn movie that will not make you think . at all . seriously . not a thought in your head , unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of scotland since kilts , gerard butler . butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of dracula not seen since frank langella 's campy 1970s performance . if you 're not in love with him already , you will be after watching the dvd extras . his interviews are charming and fun . though watching his audition reel , where he tried to emote wearing full `` atilla '' hair and make-up , was sort of uncomfortable . so if you like wire fight scenes , new intrepretations of old myths , mardi gras beads and pretty scots , this is the movie for you . if you want to think , there are plenty of documentary dvds available on this site ! cheers
this decades old book will probably go down as one of the most successful books ever . the ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age . this book is about sensitivity , not sensitivity to the weeping child , but the sensitivity required to maintain a successful business . this books speaks about being not only sensitive to your customers , but being sensitive to your employees , a major problem with many companies finding it difficult to survive . actions speak louder than words , everyone knows it , hardly anybody does it . empowerment , give people the means and freedom to shine . listen , quit trying to teach the world , let the world teach you . keep things simple , simplicity allows for focus and leads to success . easy concepts to understand , not so easy to apply . this book is about principles . it could certainly be argued that most of the advice given in this book is anecdotal , but this fact is also why it has lasted this long as a viable text . those that want to argue this point are usually the same individuals that do n't understand the principals and do n't apply them , hence why they need this the most . sure , most people intuitively know these principles , but how many need reminded ? people are moved more by general concepts that are flexible enough to be applied to most situations . this book provides just that
this cd will really grow on you . so listen to it several times before you make your final judgement . it is one of van morrison 's best . this cd appears to be almost autobiographical at times . especially stranded ... just like greta ... they sold me out . his jazz background , his irish background , his blues background ... are all present on this cd .
this is a powerful down to earth movie , it is very well done . the actors , script , storyline , , , is totally awesome . it is a must sse for , ,not just the alternative lifestyle communities . jenn
whatever happened to melody , creativity , individuality and good old beats ? somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who ca n't sing , write or play an instrument , songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel . fortunately the eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original , quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times . ( `` sweet things '' is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so . ) the haunting voice , odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner . my grade :
i have owned this cd since the day it came out and i have not stopped listening to it . i like all rap and hip-hop for the most part . i love lyric , social driven rap like the roots and talib kweli and mos def , but i also have no problem throwing crunk club ish in the deck like three six mafia or lil ' jon . that said , this album completely blows me away and it seriously pains me that obie trice is so slept on . this album is better than second round 's on me , most likely because he had more help from em on this one truthfully , but still , both cds are great . i just wanted to write this review to do something to try to spread the word . this cd is unbelievable . my three favorite rap cds of all time are the notorious big- life after death , eminem- the eminem show , & obie trice- cheers . i love the female-problem-driven songs on here like lady , hands on me , & even do n't come down about his mama . the lyrics are unreal and his style is unprecedented and fresh . he is creative , witty , and his flow is downright cold , not to mention production is superb . please buy this cd
mid eighties sst indie rock classic ! this was the very first sonic youth album i owned . i got the vinyl in <NUM> at the age of <NUM> and it blew my mind and has ever since ! the best song on the album in my opinion , and one of sonic youth 's best songs period is `` expressway to yr skull , '' aka `` madonna , sean and me , '' aka `` the crucifixion of sean penn . '' whatever title you prefer , this song is a beautiful , powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time . it 's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece i have ever heard . chiming scree infused with bliss , it builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top , then the way the bass , drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure . if you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience . on the vinyl it ended side <NUM> with a locked groove , meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle , playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off . while `` expressway '' is a highlight , the rest of the album is awesome as well . lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era , but that is only one aspect of this album . another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates ; many of the songs are different from one another sonically , yet the album is cohesive . songs like `` in the kingdom # <NUM> , '' with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of d.boon 's tragic death , and `` marilyn moore , '' and `` shadow of a doubt '' just transport you atmospherically . i have recommended this album to many new listeners of sy , some find that they do n't like it as much as `` sister '' at first , because many of the songs are n't as `` immediately accessible '' as the gems of that album , but with more listens it rewards them , it grows on them and they like it as much or more . bublegum is a cover , i believe of an old kim fowley song and was not on the original release , but was a b-side ( of the starpower single if i remember correctly ) added in the cd age . it seems somewhat out of place , especially following expressway . in any event , this recording is one of sy 's best , and in my opinion one of the best period . buy it , it 's magical .
this ultra famous recording of the the beethoven fifth and seventh is absurdly overpraised . i 'm not going to be a mr. know-it-all and attack these performances just because people love them , i 'm just going to try to be fair and impartial and get at the core of why these recordings should n't be deemed so unsurpassable . kleiber is an exceptional conductor and he knows exactly what he is doing , his penchant for drama , attack and drive , work well with these two symphonies but they miss quite a bit too . the vpo for instance is a great orchestra but they do n't always rise to the challenge here . i want to pay particular attention to the sound of these recordings which is simply not that great . it 's servicable , actually typical deutsche grammophon sound from the mid-70s . it 's cold , at times harsh and stringy . the opening of the last movement of the 5th symphony is shrill , there is no resplendent majesty here like you get in karajan 's <NUM> version or guilini 's version from the early <NUM> 's with the lapo . kleiber 's first movement is fast , intense but lacks the ultimate power i heard in the karajan and giulini versions . the second movement is good , kleiber does n't rush things , the scherzo is terrific , the transition to the finale does n't have much mystery , certainly not the heaven storming insanity that furtwangler brings to it in his war-time recording from the <NUM> 's . kleiber is also very literal in his observation of repeats in these works . repeats everywhere you can find them is typically the norm in recent times . the repeat in the first movement is a must , obviously every conductor takes it but the finale repeat is a matter of choice . kleiber of course takes it and it 's to his credit that the movement does n't drag as it might under someone else . giulini 's last movement does drag because he takes a slower tempo along with the repeat . karajan on the other hand , never took the finale repeat in any of his versions , from 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s ! all the karajan versions fly to the finish with unbelievable , exhilarating force ! so with giulini or kleiber , you 're more exhausted by the end of the symphony , with karajan , you 're on cloud nine , ecstatic because of the power of the berlin philharmonic and because he skips the redundant repeat . of course kleiber 's version is terrific but i would not give it this high of a status among classical recordings . here are the best beethoven 5ths , any karajan version , especially the '62 and '77 , the later <NUM> 's digital version is extremely powerful too but not as well played as the earlier versions . they all do pack quite a punch . giulini with the lapo is among the best , then carlos kleiber is up there in that great company as well , but not the definitive at all . if you want a furtwangler 5th , of course there is the war-time performance to go to . it has a slow first movement but the rest of the work is majestic beyond words . unfortunately you have to deal with the mono sound , even though it 's not that bad . the 7th symphony is a tricky one and i 've never been completely convinced by any version that i 've heard . kleiber once again takes all the damn repeats ! it 's ok in the first movement , but he takes one too many in the scherzo and he takes the repeat in the final movement which makes things way too repetitive , many conductors used to skip this repeat but kleiber is so bloody literal minded ! karajan 's versions of the 7th are just too driven for my taste , even though karajan 's finales have always been the best ! the fast speed works well in the finale . kleiber is less driven than karajan and carlos is also more humane in the allegreto . however , all these versions just do n't spark me too much . furtwangler on the other hand is outstanding but of course you have to deal with the old mono sound . you can find his version on the music and arts label . in addition , check out the very weighty , traditional approach of christian thielemann with the philharmonia orchestra on a recent beethoven record , with great sound that easily surpasses the sound of the kleiber and karajan recordings . what you ultimately have here in kleiber , is pretty intense , terrific performances but with some catches involved . the sound is not great , the vienna philharmonic lacks the unbelievable virtuosity of the berlin philharmonic and kleiber insists on all the repeats just like most recent conductors and that tends to make things drag in the 7th symphony . all reservations aside , they are still great performances but this is surely not the holy grail of classical recordings !
thanks for reading . i 'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people . this stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs ! as usual the album is a great mix of slower and faster songs . the early line-up was great , albiet missing don felder . ( forget about walsh ) what 's remarkable for me is not the hit songs `` take it easy '' `` witchy women '' and `` peaceful easy feeling `` ( which are all wonderful songs ) it 's the other songs . some are just brilliant , including `` chug all night '' `` tryin '' and the best non single ever from the eagles `` take the devil '' mind blowing song from randy miesner . great guitar and melodies as usual . this is my second favourite eagles album , just pipped by `` one of these nights '' a must for music fans in general . this is great music ! ! ! essential for your collectio
this is a great one- gets your muscles working ! ! ! i alternate between this one and the `` crunch- cardio sculpt '' on my off days from the gym- a well-worth it effort & a decent workout for <NUM> minutes
sometimes i still ca n't believe the constant quality of joni mitchell 's discography from the early days in <NUM> up until <NUM> . mitchell released several masterpieces , not only the well-known blue and court & spark , but also the 'transitional ' albums for the roses annd hissing of summer lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as i 'm concerned . from there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting , as mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz , classical and even african music on don juan 's reckless daughter . the album takes some time to get used to , but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like blue . here mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an african drum-and-chant piece ( the tenth world ) , awkward minimalist-music ( the gorgeous dreamland ) and a 16-minute song that packed folk , jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called paprika plains . the other songs continue where hejira ended , most notably the lovely jericho and talk to me . the endresult is simply a fantastic record , that many people had problems with upon the original time of release . too experimental , too weird , too out-there . that may be , but fact is that don juan 's reckless daughter stands as joni mitchell 's most interesting and boldy innovative work . ever .
this film can be interpreted any number of ways : as a farce ; a tragedy ; or just plain shakespearean comedy . brenda blethyn has , in the past , acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill
'the greatest story ever told ' had the very real potential of being one of the biggest disasters in motion picture history . think about it for a moment . who would want to sit through a <NUM> hour and <NUM> minute film about jesus with a virtually unknown blond haired , blue eyed swedish actor named max von sydow in the lead role ? add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in hollywood . sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project . surely director george stevens pulled off a major miracle . aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary alfred newman , some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you 'll ever see and an unforgetable performance by max von sydow 'the greatest story ever told ' lived up to it 's title to become the definitive film version on the life of jesus of nazareth . a classic from '64 that belongs in everyones ' dvd library . one of the essentials
reading a poem by baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in paris . formidable ! i always return to this book , and i buy as many translations of it as i can . this one i think is the best . as a poet , baudelaire was the master of describing the `` dark regions '' of the human soul . he was the edgar allan poe of poetry .
if the astralwerks label that released this <NUM> gem were clever they 'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says : `` featuring : 'super <NUM> ' , as heard in the new quentin taratino movie kill bill vol.1 ! ! ! '' then watch the sales of neu ! <NUM> surge its way up to the top of the billboard album charts , purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick . okay , that may never happen , but still , it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of `` super <NUM> '' 's turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of tarantino 's movie . `` super <NUM> '' might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music , but as representation of the superb , and breif , discography of neu ! 's body of work it does the band a great disservice . hearing this track rekindled my interest in neu ! 's music again , and to write this review . neu ! <NUM> is perhaps best approached as two halves , the first half , which consits of the first <NUM> tracks : `` fur immer '' , `` spitzenwualitat '' , `` gedenkminute '' , and `` lila engel '' ( as of this writing amazon 's tracklisting is incorrect ) . this is the heart of the album , with the driving `` fur immer '' connecting the dots between kraftwerk 's motor beats with alternative rock riffing . `` lila engel '' pounds agressively like there 's no tomorrow , years before it became fashionable in punk music . did i mention this music was originally released in '73 ? awesome ! the second half consits of the remaining <NUM> tracks which , reportedly due to budget restraints , were recorded with minimal material . the band 's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable ( complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping ) . the woozy `` cassetto '' feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last , wretched gasp . this section of neu ! <NUM> is remixing in its most primitive form . although it 's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion , the approach wears itself thin quite early , and hardly justifies any repeat listens . i would say that neu ! <NUM> is second best behind the band 's self-titled debut ( rating : <NUM> stars ) , and tied with their 3rd and final ( ? ) effort neu ! <NUM> , where neu ! were beginning to sound too self-conscious , imho . neu ! 's music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled `` alternative '' these days . it 's good enough for tarantino , and it 's good enough for you ! buy it ! favorite tracks : `` fur immer '' , `` lila engel '' , `` super '' final rating : 3.5 out of <NUM> .
this disc will bring back some pleasant memories . any disc with & quot ; drift away & quot ; on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it . this one just happens to have & quot ; brother louie & quot ; & quot ; it never rains in southern california & quot ; and & quot ; stuck in the middle with you & quot ; . the sound quality is exceptional , just like any disc by rhino
this book is a very good one . it is an experience hopefullyyour children will never have to deal with . jane leslie conly did agreat job writing this book <NUM> stars
the shield is one of those shows i think that will attain even more pop culture status as time goes on , even long after it leaves the airwaves . the show is centered on cops who do corrupt things in order to ultimately put a major smash into the drug and arms trades in los angeles . i 've spent my reviews of season one and two going in depth on how the camera 's angles are unique and how each character has a ton to contribute to the show . this time i 'm simply going to tell you little bits and pieces of what is going on with season three , and it will probably not make any difference because if you have already seen one and two , you know you have to go back for more ! season three tends to get deep in two areas . the one area is the character development . mackey 's ongoing separation from his wife , coupled with finding out his second child is also autistic is a big downer , but besides that he 's also laying pipe everywhere east of l.a. so it apparently is n't bothering him as much as he 'd like to let on . things between him and shane vendrell start to go south quickly . shane and vic were always good friends but as the pressure for the team to produce results as well as keep secrets and stay within boundaries mounts , vic starts pulling back , starts easing off . this action does a boomerang effect for shane vendrell , who launches forward with more reckless abandon on cases than never before ! despite all the drama in their personal lives ( yes , julian the african american cop , is still gay , still a devout christian to the point of fanatically , and still married to a women he 's trying to have a child with ) the street lives are alive more than ever . rival gangs , horrible hit squads , ci 's ( confidential informer ) and sting operations happen in a one two three punch combination throughout the series . kicking off-season three , we have two gangs who are bad , mad and territorial . they are the byz latz and the one-niners . oh and did i mention they both acquire massive amounts of mp-5 submachine guns to try and further their struggles ? the armenian mob of course , is still in the ongoing storyline from season <NUM> , and its not getting pretty . people are still showing up with they 're feet cut off , and it looks like they are not going to stop . where did their money go , and who shot two of their men when it was taken ? oh well , excuse us , we 're the armenian mob , and our money train is gone , so its time to hack off more feet ! speaking of the money train , vic decided to use some of it in an undercover operation , only to accidentally circulate it back into the drug trade . what vic does n't know is that there was someone else watching the armenians , and slipped in ten thousand dollars worth of marked bills . the strike team is in hot water as well as the `` decoy squad '' is now implemented to ultimately take over their job after a trial run . this is how great this series is , you take a bunch of newbies and chuck them into an ongoing plot and all they do is add their talent in acting and screen presence to the table . some interesting heat will come down on the decoy squad , as well as something terrible happening to juliens former partner tommy . the corruption and mystery within the crime community runs deep , but does n't ever lose us much . on the surface we still are able to keep up with the strike team walking the line between good cop/bad cop , and gangs galore continue to wreak havoc in the streets . the drama and problems with each character continues to mount to the point you think it will crash before winning . wrong again , these stories are tightly written and really do a good job to keep us intrigued because lets face it , like life , in the shield you never know what is going to happen next . the last few episodes are pretty intense . the strike team gets dissolved and shane gets partnered up with a new guy named `` army '' ( he 's an iraq war veteran ) . shane and vic have a showdown of sorts , which really comes from all of the money issues and changed tactics involved in the money train . season four will surprise you as well as please you , as it will see the roles of these <NUM> friends change quickly enough . season three starts off a little slow but considering the buildup to the ongoing storylines that are really turning into quite the dramatic and suspenseful mini-epics we hoped they would be , it 's well worth the weight . claudette and dutch are still there cracking cases every day . aceveda also appears to be going over the edge and it will be interesting to see if he can ever come back in the future
wow , the reviews here are pretty high strung , like they 're expecting this to be some kind of serious avant garde film , critiquing the early 80s , the art/fashion scene rebellion against the dullness of suburbia , sexuality , etc . i suppose you could try to load all of that into this , but i saw it as a parody that pokes fun at these types of pretention more than anything else . you get some of the atmosphere from that time , the characters and acting are pretty good , and it hangs together as scifi . there are some fun mind games in it as well , which are surprising to some viewers , but i do not want to reveal the hilarious plot twists . that is about it , no big deal , nothing all that deep . if you look at it as , well , entertainment , you can allow yourself to enjoy it for the fairly simple thing that it is . recommended . warmly
for whatever reason i bought this album much later on than the other two english beat albums - something about it & quot ; not being as good & quot ; . that 's complete nonsense . this album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later , after the fact as it were . there 's not a weak track on this cd . plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound . & quot ; dreamhome in nz & quot ; , & quot ; walk away & quot ; , and & quot ; monkey murders & quot ; are lost <NUM> 's classics to go along with the better-known & quot ; doors of your heart & quot ; and & quot ; too nice to talk to & quot ; . love the alternate version of & quot ; get-a-job & quot ; found here . i rank this second beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to & quot ; i just ca n't stop it & quot ; ; it 's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than & quot ; special beat service & quot ; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll . looking back , i wish the english beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like & quot ; wha'ppen ? & quot ; . they probably do too
this book is , i am convinced the best overall introduction to christian ethics and the thought of stanley hauerwas . hauerwas has certainly written many wonderful books , but this one stands out in that it encapsulates a fairly coherent and articulate manner , his conception of what christian ethics is and how they are lived out in the life of the church . hauerwas first offers a critique of ethics that would have pretentions to a universal status . the way he states this is that all ethics require a qualifier ( 'christian ' , 'jewish ' , 'hindu ' , etc. ) . every concievable ethic is grounded in a tradition and a narrative that gives substance to the ethical claims . thus , even though christians believe that christianity is true and christian ethics are the right way for all people to live , this reality can not be known without becoming a christian , thereby making the stories of israel and jesus your story . thus , christian ethics are not universal in the sense that they can be percieved as correct by anybody . rather to understand christian ethics as true , one must be transformed through participation in christ through the church . this , of course grounds hauerwas 's claim that the church as a concrete community is the locus of christian ethical reflection . obviously , the major theme of this book is nonviolence . hauerwas grounds this approach solidly on the narrative of the cross and resurrection of christ which he holds to be decisive for the content of christian claims about the world and life in it . over-against those who advocate an ethic of justifiable violence , hauerwas contends that christian ethics must be informed by the biblical narrative of christ , who won god 's victory precisly through rejecting violence and inaugurating god 's kingdom of justice and peace which the church is called to embody . hauerwas 's ethic , contra ramsey , gustafson , niebhur , neuhaus , stackhouse , novak and others argues that christ 's teaching , life , death and resurrection should be decisive for our ethics , rather than dismissed as irrelevant . in much of this hauerwas draws on the excellent work of john howard yoder in `` the politics of jesus '' and `` the original revolution . '' this is a vitally important book , even for those who disagree with hauerwas 's christ-centered , ecclesial ethic . he very clearly shows in this book how his ethic takes into account the importance of deicisions and cooperating with non-christians in the interest of social justice , issues that his critics often ignore in their overblown critques of his work . this is a vital book for christian theologians , ethicists and the all christians who desire to take the gospel seriously . highly recommended
i was asked once what my favorite pavement songs were ... there are some pavement songs which fit certain moods * perfectly * , and at those times , i do n't have a choice but to count them as my favorites . for instance ... i was in new york a few springs ago , spending the evening with the girl i 'd had a brief-yet-effective romance with the summer before . she was there with a guy ; i was there with two other girls , mutual friends . the five of us were in an underground , literal-hole-in-the-wall-type bar , tucked away inside a subway station at 50th street ( i think ) . the bar was called siberia , and was a total punk/russian ( prussian ? ) paradise . every light bulb was red , and there was writing on every inch of the walls and tables . the lone bathroom stall had a gaping three foot hole busted out of the wall on one side , through which you could see only blackness . the sofas had long ago collapsed on their stumpy legs and fallen to the sticky floor , where they laid dejected and off-balance . cushions were missing and the beer was extremely expensive . i got drunk and watched her ... got drunk on the beer and the nostalgia both , pressed myself into a musty corner of the couch , and after a while , closed my eyes . there was a jukebox . it was the brightest and biggest thing in the whole place . it had & quot ; crooked rain , crooked rain & quot ; in it . i played & quot ; fillmore jive , & quot ; wallowed in its brilliant decadence ... i played it again then got up and roamed around manhattan for <NUM> hours . alone and happy . that night , & quot ; fillmore jive & quot ; was my favorite pavement song
having read the bagavad gita , it only much later dawned on me that carlos is arjuna and don juan is krishna - only the wisdom is completely different . but in the gita we have arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud , but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at krisna 's encouragement to go through with the pasage . arjuna keeps telling krishna he does n't understand a word krishna said and krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for krishna to fully express the wisdom , spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos , it is necessary for arjuna to not get him and to be continually the baffled coward , hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity , and always planted at square one while krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - `` karma for the complete idiot '' .castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the don juanisms to the reader . and they are truly profound - they 're too heavy to be something castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth ! castaneda did his research and it 's the power of the don juan `` nuggets '' that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader ! that said , however , i got the feeling that castaneda was , by the 4th or 5th volume , really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level . castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite and material trappings . and so has the bagavad gita

the organizer lady , sandra felton , is back with organizing magic : <NUM> days to a well-ordered home and life . actually , felton explains at the beginning that these are not forty consecutive days because some of the projects require a change of thinking , such as finally feeling that you can invite someone into your home . it 's more accurately described as forty projects than forty days . felton offers ideas as varied as dealing with the paper crunch , saving time , e-mail , organizing closets , efficient movements , developing a visitor-friendly attitude , and upgrading your home . ( no , she does n't mean blowing it up and starting from scratch as my mom has suggested ! ) she gives the reader permission to reject whatever projects do n't work for you while developing a new style of thinking . felton is an engaging writer with a practical , friendly style . she lets readers struggling with clutter not feel guilty . angry yes , guilty no . most chapters include several helpful pointers and boxed quotations to encourage you such as , `` if you ca n't move the mountain , move a few stones . if there is a better solution ... find it , '' by thomas edison . the book ends with a resource bibliography . one of the good things about the book is that she provides options for you to consider and suggests you choose one that you feel comfortable with . for instance , in her chapter on making bold judgment calls , she gives you eleven project choices which range from dropping out of a club , giving up addressing christmas cards by hand , throwing out all mail with a bulk postmark unopened , rotating your visible knickknack collections , using paper plates for quick clean up , and more . some of her suggestions sound familiar to me because i 've read one or two of her books over the years , so those who have read some of her other books may want to look this one over before purchasing it . those who are new to the struggle to organize their lives will find her ideas helpful and her writing engaging . - debbie w. wilson , christian book previews.com
this is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album . now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise . i like almost every song here but i skip about <NUM> of them and the rest i can listen to all the way through . i recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but i recommend it
i had the opportunity to see tom braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader , dunbar middle school ( then dunbar high school ) . `` julian 's smile '' and `` bounce '' are superbly played , smoothe and fresh sound . see him live if you get the chance , buy the cd anyway
this album is what the goo is all about ....... they were at their best here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
the lowest price at the time i ordered it and real quick shipping too
great movie for wwii buffs . one of the best submarine movies in my opinion . however , people who are not hard core war movie viewers will likley find it too slow and boring . they did a great job getting it on dvd
like it or not , we are all on a spiritual path , consciously or unconsciously ! our minds deem it `` difficult '' , but in truth , we are spirits having a human experience , not humans having a spiritual experience . with this in mind , this author 's book is a stellar , yet gentle , reminder to get out of our heads , and into our spiritual heritage . much of what he writes makes me do just that : `` oh yes , i know that , thank you for reminding me yet once again ! '' so much of this book resounds deeply in my heart . we all need this gentle reminding , no matter what stage we think we 've achieved on this journey . this book is written with light-hearted-ness that makes me smile , and pick up it up once again for pick-me-ups.keener jansse
robert schuller 's book & quot ; tough times never last but tough people do & quot ; gave me the insight to understand life and the knowledge that everyone goes through tough times at some point in their lives . the challange is how we deal with those times and how each one of us can take these difficult situations and turn them around into something miraculous . when you think you just ca n't take one more step and you read this book you will know that you can and as dr. schuller says , & quot ; inch by inch anything 's a cinch ! & quot ; if you are going through very tough times i strongly suggest you read this book so that you too can become a & quot ; possibility thinker & quot ; and turn your & quot ; scars into stars & quot ;
this is a great dvd . the guitar style spectrum is covered here with country , blues , and rock , with tips and tricks to enhance your own style . greg uses fender strats and telecasters ( my favorite guitars ) throughout the video and explains and demonstrates his unique style in a way that you can pick up on with a little practice and not be totally discouraged . this dvd is filled with humor , great teaching and superb pointers for expanding your technique . if you are a fan of greg koch or would want to make your playing really stand out , you need this video
this book has cast the alleged biblical condemnation of homosexuality in a whole new light . for those who always felt that there was something very wrong and un-godly about the fundamentalist 's extreme anti-gay views , this book will certainly confirm what you have known and felt in your heart all along . for those christians with gay family and friends , who have understood first hand the conflicts between what they know , experience , and god has impressed within their hearts , and the fundamentalist ( and even mainstream ) condemnation of the lives of your loved ones , this will open your eyes to the reality and truth of what is written in the bible . all in all a great read and an eye opener .
this is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math . it is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him . it gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war . it changed my view of what is possible . i was taught in psychology <NUM> that the horse gentle hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer , that he was n't really able to think . beautiful jim key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change . wonderful history
this movie is incredible . it has a great way of deminstating how judgemental people that should n't be judgemental are . this movie catches your heart and you get wrapped up in it . <NUM> stars for sure . its was an incredible movi
this book was supprisingly fresh . it had something new that other books just do n't have . it was a very deep book . it realy does allow you to know existence bette
the man who was n't there is a movie by the always unpredictable coen brothers . their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it 's fun to see what they 've come up with next . out of the ones i 've seen , my thoughts are mixed . i mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like raising arizona , then one of the best movies of all time with fargo and then go terribly wrong from there ? then you 've got the big lebowski , a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness . not what i call a good movie . then there 's the ladykillers , a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything . so they 're just getting worse by age , right ? wait ! let 's go back two years to <NUM> . it was in this year that this unheard of movie was made . of course , its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle . and that 's the beauty of this gem . the cinematography . the look of this world and the 1940s feel it 's good is brilliant . but it 's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own . it is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others . but first , let 's talk about the plot of the movie . ed crane ( billy bob thorton ) is living in california in the 40s with his wife , doris ( frances mcdormand ) . doris is part of a community that talks and talks . but not ed . ed narrates this story ... his story . he sees it in black and white or maybe that 's the way it really is . you 've got to think . ed is a barber and is proud of his job . he only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration . so here , there is some more originality , brilliance and beauty . when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss , big dave ( james gandolfini ) , he reacts with harshness . he blackmails big dave but something goes wrong . big dave finds out and ed kills him out of defense . and this all happens in the first <NUM> minutes . doris is accused of doing it and from then on , you 're in for a real treat . when ed is n't narrating , like i already said , he is n't talking . so what he does is smoke , cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed birdy ( scarlett johansson ) play piano . her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty . tony shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer freddy riedenschneider . he 's a big shot who talks and talks . keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the `` you do n't know '' repeated a bunch of times . believe me , you 'll know when you 're hearing it . the movie is a sad and tragic tale , a tale showing how badly one man 's life can go in a world that is n't for him . he 's different . it 's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one ... he stands out because he 's different . the man who was n't there is hands down an excellent movie . it is a close second to fargo in the coen 's movies . my last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves . this movie is rated r for a scene of violence ? is that a joke ? that scene was in black and white and showed nothing ! you people really have no idea what you 're doing . pulp fiction ( r ) =the man who was n't there ( r ) get it straight people , your ratings are horrid . james bond flicks have worse content than this .
this is one of the best novelas i have seen in years i was up until 5am
this <NUM> release shows renaissance at a peak and the excellent music on this album certainly reflects this - it is a personal favorite in fact . i really appreciate the craft that the band put into their music ; not to mention the emotional sophistication and superb musicianship . this album is an especially fine example of these qualities . the music of renaissance is very disciplined ( i really appreciate this ) for a rock band and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band . keyboardist john tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor pipe organ and harpsichord work , along with a string synthesizer - it is used effectively throughout the album and marks a point where john started using synthesizers more . electric guitars are absent and michael dunford employs both strummed and picked parts on the acoustic guitar , which further emphasizes the classical approach . in fact , it is only john camps virtuosic bass playing on a trebly rickenbacker bass and to a much lesser extent , terence sullivan 's drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions . to emphasize the classical `` thing '' even further , an orchestra is featured on this album , and this may very well be their most classically influenced record . saving the best for last though , annie haslam has one of the most stunning altos i have heard - the delicate textures of her voice are both positive and uplifting . the pieces on scheherazade include a single short track ( the vultures fly high 3'04 '' ) , two pieces in the mid-length range ( 7'05 '' ocean gypsy and trip to the fair 10'51 ) , and finally the massive multi-movement scheherazade suite ( 24'37 '' ) . the suite is a very sophisticated piece of music and is extremely well-arranged ; with dense ensemble work and breathtaking dynamics . the scheherazade suite is incredible and my favorite composition by the band - i think it neatly sums up everything that i love about their music . in addition to the suite , there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track ocean gypsy , although all of the other pieces are very strong . this remastered effort by repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos . in summation , this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band ( 1973-1977 ) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music . if you like this recording , also check out ashes are burning ( <NUM> ) ; turn of the cards ( <NUM> ) ; and novella ( <NUM> )
i would just like to take this opportunity to point out that the previous reviewer is mistakenly talking about from her to eternity , cave 's first album . the firstborn is dead is quite good , though , even if nothing else on it quite matches the greatness of tupelo
sonny rollins , ray brown and shelly mann are all superb on this <NUM> minute album . it comprises <NUM> tunes ; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks . the originals and alternates are similarly compelling . although my personnal favourite is wagon wheels , all <NUM> tracks are excellent . the uncanny sense of space and the western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening . i am a big fan of sonny rollins and his happy , muscular , witty , rich and edgy sound . this album sees all three musicians in marvellous form , with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement . i would recommend this as the album to buy to begin a sonny rollins collection . no words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you ; however some may point in the right direction . they are ; lyrical , witty , warm and imaginative . way out west is most original and is one of my favourite cds .
i thought this product was awsome , a classic , cheaply priced , and i recieved item way before the delivery date . recommend buying movies from this seller . this movie was creative ( although it was in subtitles ) , and equally unique from any of the other movies i found over the internet .
this is the best albert collins cd you can buy . the guitar playing is amazingly wild . its one of the great blues albums ever , it certainly has the feeling of a great live seesion in the studio . all the different styles of blues that mr collins played are well represented here : shuffles , slow blues , minor blues , fast sinstrumentals , etc . more satisfying than any compilation . warning : you 'll want more after this
i ca n't get enough of this music . the lyrics are great , the music hints of a cross between the best of the police and the best of peter gabriel . if you ever loved these bands you 'll love this . it 's the most compelling music of its kind i 've heard in a long time . listen to & quot ; i fall to pieces & quot ; and you 'll agree
if this was released by the generic nu-metal bands in <NUM> , this album would be their best album . yea , my point is that in flames did n't sell out in rtr . they still have solos in most of their songs ( although less than their previous works ) and amazing riffs ( not as many dual ones as jesper and bjorn were able to produce before ) . and also anders voice has n't changed quite yet and still is as good as colony and clayman , with the addition of singing . even though it is a step down , it is still sounds like in flames . and speaking of a sell out album , i would reccomend soundtrack to your escape because that is a sell out ! songs i 'd reccomend from this album : reroute to remain drifter trigger transparent dismiss the cynic
one of the best writings from hammet , if not the best . i enjoyed it very much . i could n't stop reading to look for what happens next . a must
i just finished watching i , robot on hbo . i ca n't vouch for the quality of the picture or sound of this particular dvd , just the storyline . i really enjoyed it . a lot of action , but there is ( obviously ) a philosophical undertone to the whole film . purists will probably dislike that the philosophy ( and much of the original story ) of isaac asimov 's book takes a backseat to the action . during some scenes , i was thinking : wow , they definitely made a video game about this movie . much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action , though , contrary to another viewer 's opinion , i did n't find the climax `` stupid . '' i found it complimented the philosophical aspects of the film , though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action . parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by peter singer , the radical secularist/ professor at princeton university who advocates infanticide for disabled children . specifically , this conversation from the film sticks in my mind : `` you are making a mistake . do you not see the logic of my plan ? '' to which the reply comes : `` yes . but it just seems too ... heartless . '' essentially , the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process ; just cold , detached logic , which sometimes sounds great on paper , but is much less appealing in the real world . in sum , a lot of action , though the philosophical aspect is still very much present ( man vs. creator , creator vs. man , the soul , purpose in life , free will , natural law , conscience and consciousness etc ) once you reflect on the film . mostly action entertainment , but also thought provoking on further review
i was n't expecting much when i dropped this <NUM> movie into the dvd player ... there is a lot to commend itself . matt damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam ! danny devito is slimy , shady , sarcastic , and sleazy ( in other words , perfect devito ) as damon 's partner . the main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia . the sleazy big insurance company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter . they bet wrong ! our hero , guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge ( dixon from alias ) , come to the rescue . the pieces fit together quite nicely . justice is served , bad guys are taken down , and matt damon establishes himself as an unlikely , unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process . nothing wrong with this story or this film . very delightful and satisfying in every respect .
this band has a cute singer , corina with chipmunk cheeks . she sounds like belinda carlile . i just want to pinch her cheeks !
this is a great story in context - the year is <NUM> , the author is switching from being a hedge fund manager to a full-time journalist and tv prognosticator . he 's a branding machine , so the book contains a lot of self-promotion . you see jim the hyper , jim the genius and jim the buffoon - all part of the brand . the biography takes you from jim at harvard , to jim the homeless journalist to jim the financier to jim the hedge fund operator . jim fesses up to a lot of the personal problems that he caused for himself along the way , writing in the same style he rants on tv . as such , the story carries the same fast pace as the tv . even if you do n't like him , you 'll keep reading . is this a book on how to make $ in the stock market ? not really - there are much better out there . is this the definitive biography on cramer ? that probably wo n't be written until after his lact act . will this help you understand the guy sweating , screaming and pulling his hair out in the lightning round ? absolutely
i am one of a few fixed star astrologers in the world and no matter how much i read , study or research in this fascinating area , i will always come back to ebertin 's work . though often his conclusions appear negative , if you will take them into the light of present life , you will understand how to derive the highest value for each star . for example when considering algol , the star connected to beheadings , one can examine the aspects to this star and discover the person may have a tendency to lose their head in the aligned matters astrologically described . a star of extreme passion , algol will also reflect the exact statements indicated by ebertin - take princess diana 's death or nicole simpson - both active under algol at the time of their deaths . i do not believe you can consider yourself knowledgable in fixed stars without this book . it is definitely one of the basic texts on the subject , others include the work of robison , guttman and of course recently bernadette brady .
loved it loved it , loved it ! ! ! ! ! every dog owner should read this book . it will make you laugh & cry , & you will see yourself & your struggles & triumphs with your four-legged friend on nearly every page
what a fun album ! my <NUM> month old boogies like crazy to these tunes -- and they are varied enough and laced with some grown up humor that i do n't want to run from the room hearing it over and over . it does n't have thay syrupy sweet sound found in so many kids ' albums . try it - you wo n't regret it
rosemary sutcliff excels at story telling by making the epic story of the iliad understandable and thrilling to a seven year old . i have read this book to my son at least three times , beginning when he was seven years old . he is now so familiar with the story and characters of the iliad as a result of black ships before troy that to read homer 's iliad will simply mean meeting these familiar characters again . sutcliff 's writing is so engaging that parents as well will enjoy this book . an absolute bonus is the excellent illustrations by alan lee
reviewed by stephanie rollins for reader views ( 2/07 ) steve chandler has written many motivational books , such as `` <NUM> ways to create great relationships '' and `` <NUM> ways to motivate yourself . '' `` the joy of selling '' is another great book by chandler . in `` the joy of selling , '' chandler has <NUM> shorts chapters that include practical , easy tips for maximizing the reader 's potential in sales . there are <NUM> pages in `` the joy of selling . '' it is easy to read . the font is large . it is divided into small chapters . these small chapters remind me of the format used for desk calendars . it is efficiently and effectively written . one of my favorite points is that contrary to popular belief , daydreaming is a waste of time . in response to a question about the importance of women daydreaming about their goals , he replies `` i think daydreaming is infantile , and i think it is demeaning to women how many motivational speakers try to manipulate women 's natural creativity by encouraging dreaming and daydreaming and wishing and hoping . '' he explains his point , `` stop fooling around with daydreams and wishes and spinning around the bedpost singing his name like a bad julie andrews movie ... this is an insulting recommendation to women who would like to really achieve something . '' he speaks often of turning our weaknesses into a positive part of our sales persona . do not hide the fact that you are a normal human with normal human demands and stresses . he explains how he advised a former waitress to use her experience as a waitress to improve her sales potential . she did not want to be the typical pushy salesperson , and she felt like less of a salesperson for that feeling . he explained that she did `` sell '' when she was a waitress . she let them try to make their decisions . she occasionally gave recommendations . he explains , `` when you find your talent for selling , it will become a socratic drawing out of the talent that is already there ... '' so if you are a mother and a salesperson , why hide that like it is a dirty secret ? chances are that the person you are trying to sell to is a parent . if you are way more casual than most salespeople , why feel guilty about it ? maybe you will put your clients at ease with your lack of pretentiousness . do i sound like i can relate to this ? i can . i turned being a casual mother of four into a great asset , and i now have a large client base of casual , family-oriented people . steve chandler 's `` the joy of selling '' is a book of great tips . read it a little at a time . reading a chapter a day is great . then you can dwell on the points in that chapter throughout the day . decide how you can use them . this well-written book can be quite an asset in your career in sales
this is a cute movie . the creators of this one have one fabulous imagination . i highly recommend watching this film . however , this is not for small children .
this is more realistic then some may admit . you see it all the time in the stories on tv , reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is , best example is michael jackson . everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side . that is what this movie is all about . the movie depicts the evil intentions of <NUM> immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders . the plot was pretty original . i do n't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong . it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism . you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting . there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie . almost to the point of overwhelming , but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie . i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi . storylines are a bit different , but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story .
you can argue all you want about qualifications of mr. cherniske . but i will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years , i quit cold turkey about a month before i started reading the book ... and the withdrawal was incredible .... headaches , shakes , irritable beyond belief . you ca n't say this is n't an additive drug while you 're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day . for months and months i 've had hard a time sleeping , waking up in the morning feeling like i have no energy at all . within two weeks of quitting caffien , i feel great . i still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am , yet in the morning i can now get up without any problems and i 'm awake the whole day without fatigue , feeling more energized . i changed nothing else in my diet or routine . i still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing , or most of all ... have taken none of the suggested suppliments in the book . the only thing i did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water . so save yourself a few bucks if you do n't want to buy the book , but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene . the withdrawal sucks , but it does n't last for ever . if anything once you get through it , it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine . da
this album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary who . it 's also interesting how today 's groups like green day and limp bizkit do n't even close to the who . and to orion , a reviewer on this forum , you 're a sad case , my friend . i sincerely hope that you successfully seek out the psychological help that you so desperately are in need of
andy c is the best dnb dj in the land , and this mix confirms it . this mix is insane . the best tracks on the cd are bandwagon blues and my all-time favorite track hotness . andy c mixes so smoothly and vividly . and for most of you who have yet to hear andy c 's next drum and bass arena cd ; you 're in for a treat . it far surpasses nightlife . so , if you loved nightlife , you 'll be blown away by his next drum and bass arena mix ... keep ya heads rocki
great remake of the cars great toons and only todd could do it ! ! ! the vocals and the mixes are fantastic ! !
add james luther dickinson to the pile of producer/artists whose influence is vast but whose recognition , except with cognoscenti , is minimal . he is in august company , and runs a north mississippi/memphis recording studio on par with cowboy jack clements 's outside nashville . with the revival of attention in southern roots music prompted by the best selling `` o brother where art thou ? '' soundtrack and live recording , it is surprising dickinson 's own contribution , now available on cd , is overlooked . for with this album dickinson gives a voice more authentic than a mere preservationist . this is far beyond the earliest dickinson sounds from the sun-influenced `` the goat dancers '' period . indeed , the guitar solo on `` wine '' is a fabulous execution worthy of junior brown , while the jackhammer piano is full-on honky-tonk , and if it were not for dickinson 's bulk you 'd think the killer himself had kicked over the piano stool to rip it out . the drums can barely keep up , and the wet voices of backup singers already sneak in notes they will scream horizontally in the after show entertainment . and this is only the first cut on the album , not the best cut on the album . there are , perhaps , certain points of comparison with early recordings of `` little feat , '' to which this reviewer can only respond : they stole it all from dickinson
junie b. jones books are a real blast to read ! i purchased this series for my friends daughter and she just loves the book . she wants to collect all the books in the serie
this is one of the best kid cds i 've heard . the songs are all catchy and fun to listen to . it 's a great intro to jazz
my husband made me watch this and at first i was not interested but then after a few minutes i was hooked . this is a must see . you get a good insight of just what things were like in the <NUM> 's and how the children of american indians were treated . do n't pass this one up
there are very few shows in my lifetime that i have been fiercely loyal to , but the now defunct ` once and again ' without question , topped that short list . i will admit that my lifelong crush on actress sela ward was my main interest in this series , originally . single , with no kids , and in my late 20s during o & a 's debut , i was far out of abc 's target demographic for this show . i did n't expect to like the show very much , but i got sucked in not because of sela , but because the show was nothing less than fantastic . superbly acted and superbly written , abc never gave this show a chance to find its audience , and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it 's all too early demise . even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance . the premise of the story is of rick samler and lily manning , two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces . they fall head over heels for one another , and find that life and love in the ( then ) late 1990s is far different than what they remember . adding children , careers , parents , and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for rick and lily . most shows ` jump the shark ' at some point during their lifetimes . while some could argue that the hostage episode in s2 was that point for o & a , i disagree . once and again always presented two kinds of television : good , and better . the stories and characters could fill you with hope , heartbreak , or both every week almost without fail . and best of all - everything about this show was real . very little , if any , suspension of disbelief was required . perhaps the best thing i can say about o & a is that it is the only show that i was so passionate about saving , that i sat down and wrote a letter to abc , asking them to reconsider their canceling of it ( as part of an organized campaign with other fans ) . while the campaign was n't successful , the release ( finally ) of the series on dvd will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever , as well as allow those who did n't get to view o & a during its run to discover it , and they too , might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story
this dvd is one of the reasons why i love her now.i first witness this one mtv and in was in awe when i seen this beautiful woman with such power in her voice , and her movements was amazing.i was amazed to see this lady entertain her crowd and that is why i had to purchase this dvd and that is why i love her 'til this da
kathy matthews offers no-nonsense advice with a sense of humor . this how-to-parent-and-feel-good-about-yourself book is a must read . . .and , along with jim trelease 's book on reading aloud to your children , will certainly become a standard baby shower gift from me in the coming years . matthews speaks with the authority of a mother comfortable in her own skin -- and with her own children . brava , ms. matthews
this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film . `` my life as a dog '' known in sweden as `` mitt liv som hund '' is inarguably hallström 's best known foreign language film . though he has done other films they are american or british made . `` chocolat , '' `` what 's eating gilbert grape , '' and `` something to talk about . '' he is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous swedish pop group , abba . the film is about a <NUM> year old boy in <NUM> 's sweden . he is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill , his antics prevent her from recovering , so he is sent to live with his uncle . he meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople . he often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is . the film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas sweden and some fine photography also . it remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards . it won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the ampas . though it is described by many people as a family film , it got a pg-13 rating in the us . mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue . there is a half second of full frontal female nudity , though non-sexual , it still may be a cause for parental concern . the other scene involves material that i feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it . the special features on the criterion dvd include lasse hallström 's first film , `` ska vi gå hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt ? '' which translates to , `` shall we go to my place or your place or each go home alone ? '' this film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children . there is also a theatrical trailer and an interview with lasse hallström . the liner notes also include a special notation about the film by kurt vonnegut . fans of swedish cinema will enjoy this release
this is what punk is all about . fast music , ripping bass solos , and good ... lyrics . the casualties is what hardcore punk is all about . i highly recomend this to any hardcore punk fa
i think this album is stunning and fantastic ! i have recently been getting into kates music ... first i got hounds of love and was immediatly sucked in i loved it and still do , what an album ! then i got the kick inside which i also immediatly liked but it lacked a little something not sure what that somehting is ? i then got never for ever , wow so diffrent and hypnotic and growed on me so much every time i listened , and then this . abit upset and put off but some other reviews i had set my mind to get this so thats what i did , definately not dissapointed ! so what if its more in the times and a bit over produced and maybe lacking some of the crazness ? ? ? its such a good good album ! still has amazing melodies , craaaaazy lyrics and its fun ( even though some of the subject matter isnt , kate was struggling at the time ) rubberband girl , moments of pleasure , song of solomen , lilly , top of the world and why should i love you are highlights for me but my fave song is the amazing and unbelieveably touching `` and so is love '' as soona s that song had finished for the first time for me i was like '' wow '' ..... seriously give all of kate a chance , im getting `` the dreaming '' this weekend and i know im in for an amzing challenge , but i also know i will love that too ! the red shoes doesnt deserve bad reviews just because its not people best kate album
solid cd - the highlight is candles . buy it
by far , this is afi 's greatest release , period , if you do n't like it , go kiss raf . `` no dave party '' is an effing great instrumental track , if ya do n't know where it is , ya better start looking for it . every single song on this album is perfect , this is my favorite album of all time . this is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it 's their best , no ? geoff went on to play in tiger army , he left them and is now in horrorpops . geoff 's bass playing is superb on this , the good stuff to say the least . mark 's guitar playing is pretty good , and adam 's drumming is the fast stuff . now , good old davey , the dxh . people will complain and say `` he sounds like he 's on elium '' and that `` his voice is too high '' . well , the man was <NUM> when he recorded this , what d'ya expect ? the lyrics are really good too , if you look closely , it 's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it . then it 's got the typical outcast , teen fury stuff . if you 're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 seconds , minor threat , black flag , etc.-not that fraudcore atreyu , from first to last crap you should get this . so yeah , best album ever , buy it . jx

the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i ca n't tell how much .. i know it 's an clinche but.it left me speechless i did n't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of .. just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me . all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows how do you say can that happen ? because this guy has talent . to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album . we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album on another level and i have and i wo n't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon .. the escalator only goes up ..
this is the best album and band i 've ever heard better than metallica , pantera , megadeth , faith no more etc . etc . etc . all of the songs are great but especially war enseble dead skin mask and seasons in the abyss
at the height of his wartime fame , bing crosby plays a hip young catholic priest who arrives to help a troubled parish struggle back to its feet . of course , what passed for young and hip back then , in this lily white , family-friendly comedy-drama may seem pretty silly these days -- bing is convincing , though , as he use his suave social skills to listen to and help out those in need . veteran scene-stealer barry fitzgerald plays the doddering , crusty old irish priest who runs the church before crosby 's arrival ... the rest of the supporting cast is n't as strong , but the film still has its charms . mostly it 's just a great chance to observe crosby at his most magnetic and self-assured . the film also previewed hits like & quot ; swinging on a star & quot ; and bing 's version of & quot ; too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra , & quot ; both of which are longtime favorites
this book is the type of history that students rarely get to see . textbooks tend to repeat the same old stories , many of which are only loosely based on the facts . this book goes into great depth , and even shows that many famous & quot ; cures & quot ; were nothing of the sort . this should be required reading for psychotherapists , and more importantly , for their clients
it 's an excellent book not only to read but also to use some of the techniques to help yourself . everyone should read this book especially every human being need to deal with stress , problems .... in our daily life .
what a set ! one disc of hardcore funk , and one disc of great 80s pop . kool and the gang 's transformation is just as radical as fleetwood mac 's was when lindsey and stevie joined , or when talking heads went from new wave to funk . disc one brought back a lot of memories for me ; songs i had completely forgotten about , `` funky stuff '' , `` hollywood swingin ' '' , `` higher plane '' , `` summer madness '' , and `` love and understanding '' . allegedly the early stuff kept james brown awake at night ; the gang was that funky . proof 's on disc one . the songs are mostly instrumental with a smattering of call/response . their m.o . is simple , establish the groove and work it . and then james jt taylor joined in <NUM> and , thus disc two . the gang is now a hit machine , cranking out the music like ford turned out thunderbirds : `` ladies night '' , `` too hot '' , `` celebration '' ( which will live long after you and i are gone ) , and on and on and on . even in this phase they still etablish the groove and work it , as displayed on the almost <NUM> minute `` let 's go dancing '' ... even that 's too short ! whoever put this together at universal deserves a raise or something . the songs are chronological , well written band essay , ample credits . this two disc best of should be the standard to which other record companies strive . get yours today
this is a good cardio/interval weight training workout . the entire workout is <NUM> minutes in length . you will need <NUM> to <NUM> pound dumbbells for the toning segments ( there are <NUM> or <NUM> incorporated into the cardio workout ) . the instructor leads you through some classic aerobic moves then goes into one of the weight training segments in which you will still keep the entire body moving to keep the heart rate up . the kickboxing segment is good too . there is a standing abs with weights segment near the end but she does n't do any classic floor crunches . this workout had me sweating ! it took a couple of times for me to get the routines down , but it seems to be a good cardio workout to add to your fitness dvd rotations .
dan zanes is great ! my husband and i both enjoy listening to this as well as our <NUM> month old . most of the other music cd 's that we have for our son i find a little irritating after a bit of listening . rocket ship beach is fun , family music ! i highly recommend this to all ages
the album `` sign ` o ' the times '' by prince is one of my all-time favorites . not many people i encounter know anything about this cd and that is beyond shameful because they are missing out on one of the trippiest and most joyful musical experiences known to mankind . how 's that for hyperbole ? let 's break it down .... <NUM> ) sign ` o ' the times : this is a fantastic slow and spooky funk tune that waxes philosophical about such society ills as aids , gang violence , drugs , hurricanes , murders , poverty , war and even space shuttle explosions . much like john lennon 's song `` imagine '' , this tune is just as relevant in <NUM> as it was when originally released . <NUM> ) play in the sunshine : this is one of my fave prince tunes ever . musically , it sounds like a psychedelic gospel rave up and lyrically , it is all about trippin ' on a natural high . fantastic track ! <NUM> ) housequake : prince brings the fun big time with this tune . a mixture of james brown , hip-hop and euro-dance-pop ; housequake is like nothing you 've ever heard ... and who else but prince in his prime would toss out a `` green eggs and ham '' reference in the middle of a mad-funky throw down ? <NUM> ) the ballad of dorothy parker : this is a mellow funk groove that plays like a collaboration between sly stone and joni mitchell . i kid you not ! <NUM> ) it : after four fantastic tunes in a row , you 'll be thinking `` man , this album is pure genius '' but then comes this song . the only bleak spot on an otherwise exceptional album . `` it '' is a meandering bit of danceable filler . prince released a single b-side from this same period called `` shockadelica '' that would have been much better in this position on the album . <NUM> ) starfish and coffee : this song begins with the sound of an alarm bell and proceeds to take us on a journey into the bizarre magic of childhood . another one of my faves for it 's sheer uniqueness . <NUM> ) slow love : this is a sensual jazzy love ballad that features some magnificent trumpet solos . <NUM> ) hot thing : what would a <NUM> 's prince album be without some blatant sexual innuendo ? well here it is furious and funky . the best part of this song is the saxophone work of eric leeds . <NUM> ) forever in my life : this is a slow romantic marriage proposal sung acapella with only the driving beat of a drum machine for accompaniment . yet another one-of-a-kind song . <NUM> ) u got the look : a funk-rock masterpiece with some latin percussion driving the mix . this song is the `` lucy in the sky with diamonds '' of dance music . <NUM> ) if i was your girlfriend : on this song , prince writes in a conversational style as if telling his girlfriend that he wants a closeness with her that she usually reserves for her best girlfriend . one of the most interesting and daring lyrics you 're likely to ever come across . <NUM> ) strange relationship : another out-of-the-ordinary lyric about a couple with a love / hate relationship that neither one can put an end to . features the great chorus ... '' baby , i just ca n't stand to see you happy / more than that , i hate to see you sad / honey if you left me i just might do something rash / what 's this strange relationship ? '' <NUM> ) i could never take the place of your man : this is guitar pop at it 's best with a great lyric about actually turning down a woman 's sexual advances . features a terrific guitar solo / break down midway through the song . <NUM> ) the cross : this is a song about overcoming the adversity in life through spiritual faith in but even if you 're an atheist , you wo n't be able to deny the rhythmic and melodic power of this tune . it starts off slow , quiet and acoustic then builds to an all out rockin ' climax . <NUM> ) it 's gon na be a beautiful night : this is a <NUM> minute jam-out track that was recorded live with prince 's unbelievable <NUM> 's band the revolution ... featuring shelia e. on the drums . a truly remarkable funk experience that showcases shelia e. rapping edward lear 's classic poem `` the table and the chair '' in the middle of all the musical mayhem . another one of my faver most faves ! <NUM> ) adore : this amazing album comes to a end with this gorgeous classic-style r & b ballad . what a trip ! if you 've never heard this album , i strongly suggest that you check it out immediately and give your ears a sonic treat . just skip song number <NUM>
no pictures of students sitting on the grassy area in front of the ivy covered brick building . plain and simple , who has the best major programs , period . every colleges claims they have a fantastic math , art , etc ... department . rugg 's is the book that gives you some idea of how good a certain major program is at a particular college . so if you are looking for a top physics program with a strong art program , you can find it . ruggs is the go to book , it rates the major not the school 's glossy brochure . undecided ? you can use ruggs to find the schools that have strong programs in the <NUM> areas you are interested in so if your first major choice does n't work out , you can change majors without having to change school . this book got us to our top <NUM> choices for schools based on area of interest .
it is the screenplay of the movie , the same one that should have won the oscar this year . for people who have n't seen the movie , reading the screenplay first may not be such a great idea . i know this movie went over a lot of people 's heads , and i 'm not positive one can fully appreciate the story from just reading it . however , i definately recommend reading it after seeing the movie , there is so much great dialogue that is easily missed and a lot of subtle humor that is more obvious written on the page . this was one of the best movies of <NUM> and the screenplay is a great way to appreciate it again while waiting for the dvd
the album had all the great beegees song . they are just what i wante
this is my first stephen king book , well first and a half i guess , i got halfway through dreamcatcher and completely lost interest , so i started this . i started this book <NUM> months ago , reading it only once or twice a week , but gradually i started to read it more and more . i have spent the last week reading it non-stop , i just finished it about <NUM> minutes ago . anyways , this is a great book , i found it especially fascinating because it is a story about <NUM> kids in their late teens ( and of course a killer car ) and me being a teenager , natrually loved this book . from the first sentance to the last , i had full interest . i found i could relate to the characters quite often . it starts off with long time best-friends arnie cunningham and dennis guidler . while driving home from work ( maybe it was on the way to work ) arnie spots a run down garabage '58 plymouth and instantly falls in love . he buys the car from a bitter old man named roland lebay ( little did i kno that lebay plays such a big part in the book ) . throughout the book , arnie spends his time with non-other than christine ( the name of the car ) , until he starts going out with the preetiest girl in school . arnie starts to change at this point . he is no longer the biggest nerd in school , and he is changing both physically and mentally . but pretty soon the car starts to take over his life , and take the lives of others . this book is all about a love triangle ( or in this case quadrilateral ) between arnie , leigh ( arnies girlfriend ) , dennis and christine . i recommend this book <NUM> % . i was actually a little afraid to read the ending of it , because i hated the end of dreamcathcer ( i watched the movie after reading half of the book ) and i was not to crazy about the last <NUM> minutes of it ( the movie , i have yet to read the book ) , but this book had the best ending ( in my opinion ) of any book i have ever read . trust me , you will not be disappointed
twenty-five years since its initial release , this <NUM> comedy from alan alda , its director , writer and nominal star , still holds up pretty well . in fact , i just saw norman jewison 's <NUM> film , `` dinner with friends '' , which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age . using vivaldi 's familiar string concertos as a transitional device , alda 's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season , consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year . it 's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax , but it all seems to fit the contours of the story . jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends , while his wife kate , a magazine editor , is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with jack 's constant emotional insulation . danny is a neurotic , penny-pinching dentist married to claudia , an artist with the hot temper of her italian roots . nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife anne , a housewife frozen by her self-doubts . it is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends . the group starts out with a spring fishing trip when nick confides to jack about his need for a divorce , followed by a caribbean summer boat trip when nick brings his new nubile girlfriend ginny , a wide-eyed stewardess . the fall has them visiting their kids in college , and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to ginny much to the chagrin of the wives . the last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged , especially as ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics . the acting is solid . alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as jack , and a wisely cast carol burnett is actually pretty subtle as kate . these two were such huge tv icons in the <NUM> 's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant . as the most comic pair , rita moreno and jack weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like fred and ethel mertz redux . broadway actor len cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free , while sandy dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected anne . bess armstrong plays ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance . the story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that ginny will become more integral to the group , but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty . alda does n't quite have woody allen 's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition , but the film generates a good time while it lasts . the <NUM> dvd has no extras
a murderer [ john lithgow ] gets captured by a cop [ denzel washington ] . the minute he steps foot in jail , he spends every minute of his life plotting revenge . this movie proves that denzel washington can do pretty good in action movies . then again , denzel can do good in just about any type of movie . this movie is definitely a good movie to add to your collection
i would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that `` fabric of the cosmos '' is just a rehash of `` elegant universe '' with little more to offer , and in fact not as well written . on the contrary , i found `` fabric of the cosmos '' to be equally as engaging as `` elegant universe '' and to offer a great deal of new material . it is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books , but i for one preferred it that way . i read `` elegant universe '' several years ago , and although i have a general feel for the concepts , i appreciated the refresher on many of the details . by including the background material in `` fabric of the cosmos '' i never felt lost , and i never had to refer back to another book . the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books , but it is not identical , so i never felt like i was rereading the same old stuff . another minor issue i 've seen some complain about is the use of the simpson 's ( and other ) television characters in his examples . personally i could care less what characters are used in the examples , but from a practical standpoint , i much preferred names like marge and lisa to names like slim and jim ( which were used in `` elegant universe '' ) . i could easily keep track of what marge and lisa were doing in an example , whereas i was often confused about what slim and jim were doing . the similar sounding names drove me crazy . so from a practical standpoint , i preferred the names used in `` fabric of the cosmos '' . now what about the content of the two books ? for me `` elegant universe '' was more of an introduction to string theory , whereas `` fabric of the cosmos '' was much more an exposition on cosmology . in `` elegant universe '' roughly the first <NUM> pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics , and then the remainder of the book , some <NUM> pages , was about string theory . in `` fabric of the cosmos '' roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics , ( about <NUM> pages ) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of `` what is space '' and `` what is time '' . then roughly the next <NUM> pages give an outstanding description of where we 're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe . if you want an excellent description of inflation theory , higgs fields , and the like , this is the source . and then only in the last roughly <NUM> pages does greene bring string theory into all of this , and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book . bottom line is `` fabric of the cosmos '' provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that i did not get from `` elegant universe '' . both books are outstanding , and i would certainly recommend both . the point being simply that these are different books , and `` fabric of the cosmos '' is not just a rehash of `` elegant universe '' . finally , as in `` elegant universe '' , greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next . i 've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived . in greene 's book this is never an issue . sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense , but i would much prefer a book that i can logically work my way through , albeit sometimes with a bit of patience , than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve . do n't get me wrong though , even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense , i never found it to be dry . greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout . very highly recommended
well crossfade may just be another modern rock alt metal band but that does n't make them bad . sure , they do n't really add anything new to the music out now but that should n't take away from the music itself . all i know is from what i heard they have some really good tracks . i first heard the track `` cold '' on the radio and it was just one of those songs that i love instantly . i just had to go out and get the album . after getting the album it turned out to be pretty good . i pretty much enjoyed everything on here . although , my favorite tracks would have to be `` cold '' , `` starless '' , `` colors '' , and `` dead skin '' . here 's the track ratings ... <NUM> . starless - 9.5/10 <NUM> . cold - 10/10 <NUM> . so far away - 9.5/10 <NUM> . colors - 10/10 <NUM> . death trend setta - 10/10 <NUM> . the deep end - 9/10 <NUM> . no giving up - 9.5/10 <NUM> . dead skin - 10/10 <NUM> . disco - 7/10 <NUM> . the unknown - 9/10 overall : <NUM> % a- sure , it 's not really anything new but it is good and a nice listen . i enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what crossfade has done with their new album that was just released . anyway , anyone who 's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection .
i 'm at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read . this book did the trick .. the narrator is smart , funny , and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world . certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives , one at a time . ( or maybe i 'm just jaded , too . some may call it maturity . ) clearly , the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people ( from both sides of the tracks ) . ironically , his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals . anyway , join max as he watches pathetic people with and without class , power , and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have , and help him make sense of it . great literature this ai n't , but a smart , fun , cynical read it is
i miss old fashioned letters , now that we live in the age of email . frotunately , i still have 'real ' letters saved that have now collected dust from my parent 's generation , and from a time gone by . occasionally i stumble over published letters of famous writers in antique bookstores : last time , it was a <NUM> page volume of some of ernest hemingway 's personal letters ; the first edition of this amazon edition . they were published posthumeously , and not intended by eh for publication . we get a peek behind the curtain , and learn among other things that ernest hemingway was addicted to letters , wrote lots and lots , starting in his teens ; and that he was really depressed when he did n't receive replies ; or when there were days when the postman brought no letters . waiting for transatlantic mail added to his sense of loneliness . letters were a lifelong passion of his , continuing up to the day when he took his own life . these private letters were n't meant to be published , and they are raw , but very honest . when you read them , you are in no doubt that the writer is a true artist , and an original ! they stretch over the span of his productive life , and they are varied : addressed to family ( his parents , his children ) , his ex , to friends , including famous contemporaries , such as marlene dietrich ( just one of them ) , his agent ( s ) , his publishers , and many more . i have a hunch eh must have been hard to keep up with , but his letters are fun to read ; even though , in my view , his novels are mixed : some great , and some i do n't care for . guess , eh 's life was bizare too . the private letters are consistent with that . and yet , they exude a special warmth ; both gentelness and passion . reviewed by palle jorgensen . december <NUM> .
rated three stars only because it was not as extensive as advertised . this is an introduction to the pimsleur method . it gives you a rudimentary sense of the spanish language , and not much else . if , however , your interest is in the pimsleur method and you want a good sample , this is it . a nice marketing tool ! i will be ordering the pimsleur method as a result of this teaser , so i guess it works as intended
i never listened to celine dion 's music much . i happened to check this album out from the library and had to go out and buy it after it was returned . this album has just the right mix of sad , slow love songs and up-beat ones . i would buy all of her cd 's simply based on this one
i have been a firm believer for a couple years now and this video still kicks my butt ! everytime i do this video my thighs and fanny are so sore the next day that it hurts to sit ! if you want fast results you can see and feel then this is the video for you ! jen carmen is very motivating and tough . there is no quitting with her . she makes you want finish this workout .
enough has been said about this movie already , i think , considering its overall flimsiness . it really is `` ironic '' fun , as someone mentioned , and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it . i thought it was pretty amusing . it helps if you 're into sailing and sunny ports . be that as it may , i am surprised that no one has commented on the `` theme '' song . it features quite prominently in the beginning , introducing us to the two english lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy gibraltar sailor dive ; and towards the end of the film , it introduces the final twist ... with a vengeance . as it turned out to my delight , `` you 're leaving me '' -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called `` porque te vas '' by jose luis perales , one of my favorite spanish singer-songwriters . great song , really ! silly performance , though . i 'm almost a bit curious what jlp got out of it ..
i know , i know , i am the daughter of the author but i have to say something about the book . ( remember one can be objective about a family member ) . first the quality of the food : i have been cooking a lot of these recipes - some for the past <NUM> years and they are something to be proud of ! really delicious and so easy . exceptional recipes ( which i literally dream about ) include : lima bean & amp ; pea puree , the meat loaf , the split pea soup , the rice pilaf , the bourbon cake , the red velvet cake and the chicken fricassee . just to name a few . second the variety of foods and recipes : which is a tribute to the author and her life experiences and are truly diverse ! just look at how many cultures and countries are represented here . finally , tom eckerle 's photographs : which are exquisite and transforms the book into not only a well-worn cookbook but a & quot ; coffeetable book & quot ; as well . my hats off to you , mom . i 'm proud of you . how nice of you to share with everyone
i think this is really an excellent book , one that i would highly recommend . everyone should read this and realize the words of wisdom by dr. fuhrman . i have changed my diet radically because of what he has written . a real wake up call for me ! the diet is easy to follow and one that will revitalize and energize anyone that follows it ! a great read !
best pop album of our generation .. bar none ... from the opening snare stabs of wan na be startin ' something on through the lady in my life ... this collection of songs puts the `` magic '' in .. you guessed ! magical ! sublime studio musicians , crafty songs and q 's executive duties , and of course mj 's one-of-a-kind vocal/song contributions and least not his incredible mastery of melody and groove .. you have not lived until you hear this pop masterpiece .. every song shines ! beat it .. human nature ... and billie jean .. i still listen to this album after <NUM> years ... it 's fresh , it 's vibrant ... and the beats do n't stop til you get enough
i love this album ! it takes me back to the islands , basking in the sun , sipping a mai tai , w/ some local cats playing under the palapa . i 'm a big fan of the aqua velvets , and miles playing is stunninly gorgeous on this cd as well
man , this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove . just kidding i do n't ride motorcycles , but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul . it ca n't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine , moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride 's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas
awesome ! a classic faith no more album . it will blow you away . supreme war pigs cover showing just how heavy fnm can be . even sports a little comic relief by doing a new kids on the block tun
pat uses a lot of history in this book to get his point across , thus if you like history it is quite good , but be warned that if you do n't like to read history , you may find yourself skimming through parts of the book where the history is particularly heavy , but he gets his point across.this is not to say this is a history book , but there is a lot of history reading in this book.this book is an excellant example of showing how we have gone too far trying to protect the world
if you like to explore provocative ideas , then you will enjoy biocosm . gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the anthropic principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe , and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life . he builds on lee smolin ? s hypothesis ( the life of the cosmos ) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes ( in the form of black holes ) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life . gardner points out ( correctly ) that smolin 's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers , and then offers a provocative solution . it is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes ( as they have in the past ) . this is gardner 's selfish biocosm hypothesis ( sb ) . gardner rejects linde 's `` eternal chaotic inflation '' plus a weak version of the anthropic principal ( eci & wa ) but it appears to me that gardner needs linde 's idea to produce the first universe with intelligent life . after that , sb might work . however , if eci & wa is needed to get sb off the ground , then sb is no longer useful , since eci & wa alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life . despite my concerns , i believe gardner 's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins
i will cry at anything it seems , my girl & armageddon floor me everytime , and i sometimes even cry at neighbours . so i just knew by reading the blurb of this , that i would cry . it 's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly <NUM> years . and we 've been through a lot , but never had a serious argument . as the old saying goes , guys , jobs , etc come & go , but friendships last forever . in this , the friendship starts at the age of roughly <NUM> , and the young actresses who play barbara hershey & bette midler 's characters are excellent . the little actress who plays cece bloom at <NUM> is the spitting image of bette midler - poor child ! she 's got the hair , the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat , and it 's so funny to watch her . it 's a shame mayim bialik has n't done much else , it 's mainly voice work she does now ( most notably she voices a character in extreme ghostbusters . ) they become penpals , and the relationship is played out through letters , until they finally get together . the film spirals from there , from husbands , to divorces , to arguments , to children . it 's predictable , and i did find bette midler 's character just a little irritating , but that was n't due to bette midler . it was just the way she played the character she annoyed me , she was so self centered . barbara hershey 's character was fun , kinda the sidekick to cece , and barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger , as she was playing her character through such a long period . of course you know barbara 's character is gon na get ill , but it 's the way it 's done , it 's very subtle to start with , she starts looking more tired , and then it snowballs , and it 's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful , she deteriorates really quickly , and i have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there . the funniest line in this film is my title for this review . `` over the shoulder boulder holders '' is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras . i 've heard `` wind beneath my wings '' many times before , and it 's an extremely powerful song . what made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen , and listening to the lyrics , it brought a whole new meaning to the song , a meaning that i never got before . well , that was me . thankfully , i was watching this alone at the time , cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way i did . to say beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year . even after i 'd switched it off , i was still going about the house in tears . i 'll never hear `` wind beneath my wings '' the same again . unfortunately , i bought the bog standard , no frills , dvd , not realising that there was a special edition . but i 'm quite happy with the edition i have . i 'd probably cry through the extras too . i 'll probably watch this again ( i still force myself to watch armageddon & my girl now & again , just because i love them that much ) , and i 'll probably cry even more now i know what 's coming . it 's a terrific film , and is definitely the ultimate chick flick . it 's also directed by garry marshall , so watch out for a cameo by hector elizondo
wow . a truly underrated album ( considering that i 'm only the 5th person here on amazon to review it ) and one ( of many ) of coltrane 's true genius recordings . the playing here is jaw dropingly amazing and tightly focused . the compositions are fast fast fast and executed with confidence , style , and unlimited class . highly recommended for lovers of great jazz and amazing music . highly recommended
i 'm going to keep it short and sweet : a complex plot that 's easy to follow . beautiful locations . crisp screenwriting . crack acting . sexy . intellectual . warm . you get the feeling that the actors and crew were transformed by the act of working on this movie
a previous reviewer trashed pi , why i can not comprehend , its blend of schizoid paranoia and underground religious themes leads to an engrossing and disturbing film , well worth seeing by anyone with an interest in philosophy , psychological study , and religion . some of the acting is weak , but then again it was a low budget film so one must forgive that aspect of it . however the direction more than makes up for it .......... ps his new movie requim for a dream is also a must see ....
tyreese will always get <NUM> stars from me when it comes to singing . however , the last thing we need is another rapper out there rapping about the same thing . tyreese has a sexy , sensual , and pleasant singing voice that 's very pleasing to the ears , but with the rapping it just sounds like he 's trying too hard to prove that he can rap . then again , this review may be a little biased because i 'm not used to that side of tyreese . i just do n't see him in that light , as a lyricist instead of a vocalist . i 'm sorry , tyreese will always be a singer/actor and not a rapper to me . i think that 's why he made it a double disc set because he knew that everyone would just buy the r & b disc , but nobody would buy the rap disc
'nuff said . it 's simply the best book you could read if you own an aircooled vw . read it cover to cover , follow it 's advice and you have a good headstart on being a great owner
this is their forth album , it came out in <NUM> when i was <NUM> , my boy aaron kept playin this album and i got annoyed and i asked him if i could borrow it and he let me hold it and then i can see why he kept playing it , the beats are addicting , this is when mobb deep started to go a lil commercial not too much but they still kept it real , its not ass dark as hell on earth or the infamous but it should n't stop you from listenin to this album , this is a good album but its not the same as thir ealry material , also for mobb deep or qb fans y'all should check out the murda muzik movie , it was supposed to come out back in <NUM> but kept gettin pushed back , so it finally came out in 2004.recommmended for fans of mobb deep , qb hip hop , ny hip hop , late <NUM> 's hip hop.standout tracks are streets raised me ( reminds me of junior high school days when i used to live in ny ) , what 's your poison ( featuring cormega , he murdered this track spittin that fire ) , adrenaline ( nice dark organ sample ) , quiet storm ( brings me mad memories ) , thug muzik ( produced by alchemist featuring the infamous mobb ) , the realest ( produced by alchemist featuring kool g rap , one of the illest collabos ) , usa aight then , it 's mine ( i used to play this song a lot ) , and quiet storm ( remix featuring lil kim ) .also mobb deep y'all should bring it back to murda muzik beats wise or hell on earth on your next album
dave barry writes as though he were elmore leonard on speed . it is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility , but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things can not happen , such people can not actually exist . quite . like leonard , barry 's characters get their motivations , a lot of them , from the draw of the illegal , the desire to make big quickly . they are such strange people , each one perhaps , just , possible , and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real . and barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy , leaving his readers poised to fall either way , and laughing the entire time , both from the absurd humour and from relief . i do n't know how many other books barry has since written , novels , i mean , not his humour columns ( this was his debut fiction ) , but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone . they , the columns , are n't even in the same realm , let alone league
i recommend this anime to everyone ( as long as you can handle scenes of violence directed at children ) . i 'm not one of those emotional types of people , but now and then is so profound that it even moved me . the animation is beautiful , and the voice acting is the best i 've ever heard ( note , my anime collection is small , so you may wish to take the last statement with a grain of salt ) . i was unsure when i purchased this , but after watching it , i am glad that i did . i do have some minor issues with the ending . at the end of each episode , which is how it is divided , is a preview of sorts for the next episode . to me , the preview before the final episode was a bit misleading . however , this issue is rather minute , and does not warrant a <NUM> star rating . edit : it appears my dvd player skipped at least half of the final episode . ignore the comments regarding the final episode
well , this is the first time for a review , and i was recomended to this review . so here it goes.first of all wow ! ! ! i mean wooow what a score , bear mccreary did a hell of a job on this project . its like a mix of all kinds of composers , like harry gregson williams ( from man on fire ) , halo lot of cue ` s , i could go on , and ofcause a danish group called safri duo . if anyone of your guys and girls like this kind of sumption , then buy it now
in a world filled with headlines on war and hate , you and your family will enjoy these timeless classics that enthralls people of all ages ( including men ! ) . the beautiful poetic anne captures our imagination and we can see a piece of ourselves in her with every step through her life journeys . use these beautifully inspiring books to bring your family closer together and grab the attention of your children inspiring them to read other literature . this is a must read for anyone of any age !
people who listen to andre nickatina either love him or hate him . i love him . cant get enough . horns and halos is one of the best . andre 's lyrics are random and usually make no sense , but i just love the way it sounds . the beats are addictive , just like his drug habbit
i must say that when i first heard `` kick push '' i thought to myself that this guy really had something to talk about because he is such a metaphoric rhymer and his delivery is very strong so i know i had to buy lupe fiasco 's debut album `` food and liquor '' . after listening to this album from beginning to end i was not at all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know that there are still a few rappers out there that are still kicking rhymes about issues that we deal with in everyday life instead of hearing these other mc 's that dont rap about anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , and women . i would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of real rap because this album will open your eyes to alot of things in life . my <NUM> favorite tracks are : <NUM> . `` the cool '' - this song is basically about a young man who had died ( not literally ) but he was able to come back to life and try to make a change for the better but at the same time he chose to live his life the same way he had lived it once before . song is very metaphor and deep . <NUM> . `` he say she say '' - this song is about a little boy who doesnt have a visible father and it is affecting him deeply . <NUM> . `` hurt me soul '' - this song talks just about any issue you can think of from women being degraded in rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare and overcharging healthcare , johns and prostitutes . song also has a very nice hook . <NUM> . `` sunshine '' - this song is about this girl that he falls in love with in a club eventhough he 's not looking for love he can not resist it with this girl . <NUM> . `` pressure '' featuring jay-z- very nice concept to it from lupe 's standpoint and eventhough im not a big jay-z fan he still put down a nice verse . other songs i like are `` just might be ok '' , `` daydreaminin '' , `` kick push '' , `` i gotcha '' , '' instrumental '' , and `` american terrorists '' . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a true fan of real rap because it will not disappoint you at all ! ! ! !
o.k . folks here we go , from an ex- santa barbara disc jockey to you . the best song on this excellent cd is las vegas tango . what should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of elvin jones on drum . the band itself is tight and strong . the song is kinda haunting . i 've hummed it to myself for the past forty years , and after losing the album a while back , i bought a new cd of it through amazon.com from england , and i am very happy i own it . i think everyone should own at least one of this , one for themselves and one to give to a friend . this album , and particularly las vegas tango , is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century . buy it
first off to all you <NUM> cent haters who keep posting neg reviews for his items , you can all eat a motherf * * * * * d * * * in hell . anyway i 'm a big fan of <NUM> so i went to the cinema and saw this and it was n't that bad . i reviewed tupac 's resurrection a few days ago which i also enjoyed , but it 's a documentary this is a real movie ! here is another rapper who started off living in the ghetto hustling then went to rapstardom . if you like violent films than this is certainly for you , like i said i 'm a <NUM> cent fan but you do n't have to be a <NUM> cent fan to enjoy this movie . it has music from the soundtrack played in it which is another thing you should checkout which is all great . those of course were n't the songs he was singing back then but we all want to hear new <NUM> . the film is like i said violent with course language , drug reference and sex scenes but it is very entertaining . i saw it twice at the cinema and now i think i will purchase the dvd and so should you . awesome
the best country music christmas cd i have ever heard . i have always been a fan of randy travis . during christmas , this cd is continously being played on my stereo . i would recommend this album to anybody who likes christmas music not just randy travis fans
i bought this dvd and i was not disappointed . i give it a <NUM> only because there was n't complete balance in all of the `` experts '' . particularly the mary magdelene expert . not that it really mattered , but there was now counterpoint to her beliefs that `` jesus used to kiss mary on the mouth , much to the disciples chagrin '' . for those who claim bias , i would slightly disagree . dan brown has said that his book was fiction . so for national geographic to create a documentary investigating something that was ficticious from the start is admirable . some amazon reviewers call this dvd biased and even believe that the catholic church funded the dvd . i honestly beg to differ . the da vinci code is a fanciful story . so for national geographic to take the bait and create this dvd , gives dan brown more exposure . if anything , this dvd portrays the early catholic church as misogynous with their negative and false depiction of mary magdelene . the debunking of the priory of sion with its exclusive membership is comical as well . but they had to research it as it was derived from the book . the dvd bonus features are pretty good as well . they give you a little true/false quiz at the end . man will continue to search for proof . however , those who believe in god ( and have a relationship with him ) , need not apply empirical evidence or follow logical conclusions to prove or disprove the da vinci code . even if the da vinci code was completely true ( which it is n't ) , that would n't change my faith or belief . this is something that the dvd touched on . it is christ 's message that is important , not necessarily his social life .
there seems little point to classifying this music . when standard tunes from the american songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public , music that could once be called `` experimental '' or `` avant garde '' necessarily defines the modern mainstream . if there are similarities with early landmark recordings ( e.g . miles davis ' 70s fusion groups ) , `` lawn chair society '' would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous , more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears . aside from electronics and musical synthesis , three qualities in particular stand out about this music : composition is emphasized above improvisation ; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention ( both of which require a standard repertoire ) ; tonal colors , dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with duke ellington , before the `` bebop revolution . '' lest any listeners require the `` jazz '' label to enjoy this music , kenny werner has called on the a team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces . the trumpet of dave douglas and bass clarinet of chris potter descend on `` lo 's garden '' like a busy , darting pair of humming birds ( joined at the hip , naturally ) . soon a more vegetative pace is established by scott colley 's firmly grounded bass while brian blade 's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels . meanwhile , werner 's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound , moving from prepared piano to phased fender wahs , with a dab of string synth for highlighting . `` burble_burble_spleek '' is as onomatopoeic as the title -- wind chimes , telephone rings and douglas playing some of the most vocalized ( and intestinal ) trumpet sounds this side of clark terry and rex stewart . `` uncovered heart , '' a calming guitar-like ballad in e major , is soon followed by the ambitious title number -- a collage of funked-up chatter , vocalized demagoguery by each horn player , some thoughtful discourse by werner on piano , a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns , and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters ( certainly not a reference to a familiar white house-halliburton figure ? ) . closure comes not with a bang but with `` loss , '' essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings , followed by `` kothbiro , '' an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple african melody . in conclusion , if `` kind of blue '' and bill evans ' vanguard sessions are in your blood , this one is unlikely to replace either one . all the same , it 's well-conceived , smartly-executed , cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz
season two starts off with a bang as doris gets a job in san francisco . the farm is still present though with grandpa and the boys . doris is a fantastic comedienne . her expressions are absolutely priceless .... the way she rolls her eyes in exasperation is a classic `` day '' trademark . the way she incorporates the `` ums '' in her speech is natural without being phonetically annoying .... another `` day '' trademark . she is a joy to behold and mcclean stevenson and rose marie are on hand as great second bananas ! ! this collection has some truly hilarious episodes ! ! i laughed my head off in most of them ! ! a timeless series for the whole family to enjoy ! ! no sex , no violence , no innuendos .... just good `` wholesome '' fun !
very solid release that lacks the radio friendly songs that made cracker soul & amp ; kerosene hat college favorites . overall i found the guitar work to be great , same good lyrics and much better vocals from lowery . a more creative effort than gentleman 's blues with less screaming . i do n't know if i agree that this disc has shades of camper van beethoven but this release does remind me more of their first effort cracker soul
ahh , death metal . most people either love it or hate it . one of the biggest complaints levied against the genre in particular is typically the vocal style , which is ( to the neophyte ) an almost incomprehensible , guttural growl . sort of like the crypt keeper meets the cookie monster . there are , however , many variations on this style , especially now that more `` extreme '' heavy metal has become more mainstream mid-decade , leading to a flood of different death metal bands . this canadian group sets themselves apart primarily through an extremely poppy vocal style and superb musicianship . sure , the requisite benchmarks of the genre are there-fast , heavy riffs and a vicious , almost acidic death metal bark ; but this will suddenly give way to unbelievably catchy , hooky two-and three-part vocal harmonies during a chorus or verse then suddenly revert back to the `` evil '' vocal style . it really is quite unique and original . i am instantly reminded of the first time i heard a friend 's boston album in the eighties ... it really is just a huge wall of sound , extremely well-produced . this really should n't work in the context of death metal , but it sounds amazing ! meanwhile , the guitarists are shredding all over the place in an often quite progressive and technical , and always ultra-heavy manner , as if they are auditioning for dream theater .... the album opening deluge of neoclassical-style rapid fire twin-guitar shred licks are a good introduction to what you can expect for the rest of the album . the lyrics are a bit melodramatic , unfortunately , but of course , this is death metal . sometimes it 's kinda cool ( `` eradication of the mind/beginning of the end '' ) and sometimes it 's kinds lame ( `` floating in a black sea of agony '' ) but always interesting . i am excited to hear the follow-up , which should be the band 's big album , if this was just a warm-up .... any fan of the genre should check this out , although purists might balk at the `` non-traditional '' vocal style . highly recommended
me and my wife watched american idol and to be truthful we thought especially my wife that bo should have won . my wife really loves his music and i got her the cd and now the single . i hope they let him rock the way he did on idol because the man has major talent ! ! !
the cast alone makes this one of the great films of all time . the acting is superb , the characters are portrayed as likeable and keep you cheering for their cause . it is , perhaps , steve mcqueen 's greatest film right up to and including the best motorcycle footage ever at the end . charles bronson is never better . the action/drama is intense and builds quickly to a brilliant and moving finish . every movie affecionado will want this one for the memorable characters .
this is n't really a novel and it is n't really a collection of short stories , but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons . alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time , as he imagines einstein envisioned them . each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time : time is money , time flows uphill , live in the present - forget the past , time is motion , etc . lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing , each could be the setting for powerful stories . it 's a quick read , a fun read , and well worth the 'time .

the third in ms. cameron 's trilogy continues her writing legacy . i 'll get my bias right out front -- i purchased dozens of `` the artist 's way '' more than a decade ago , and continue to gift friends with `` the vein of gold '' and `` walking in the world . '' hers are about the only books i buy in hardback because i know i 'll return to them again and again . it 's not just the guidance that makes her books so compelling . her phrasing , syntax , ability to draw the reader into her environment and circumstances , makes me keep coming back for more . she is a great story teller , as well as generous with her insights . that said , her third volume is a bit like watching a train wreck . especially chapter <NUM> , as we enter the abyss with her , i began to feel some cracks in the foundation of daily pages and artist 's dates . it appears that ms. cameron is struggling with her own advice -- `` keep the drama on the page . '' and some of us may feel our own resolve begin to crumble . but as the book progresses , the theme of perseverance certainly proves its value . those of us who feel we know ms. cameron recognize instantly why she would be walking on mental eggshells . not only is she not going back to taos this summer , but she also has chosen to close out her artist 's series with this third book . readers will miss both , and in that knowledge share a small bit of the grief that ms. cameron must be experiencing
i read this in high school and could certainly relate to holden at the time . he 's an angry , rebellious , sarcastic teen with a serious attitude problem . throughout the story , he grows , he learns and he faces some really horrible things in his past . the story is 'badly ' written to some standards but in an artistic way which reflects the character . there are a lot of intense situations and some profanity ( as a teen i was like `` cool ! '' hehe ) . in the beginning , holden seems to hate te world . you start out hating holden and thinking he is a jerk but through the course of the story you learn so much about him and you share his pain . you learn that benieth a tough mask , lies a smart , sensitive and thoughtful person . it 's a flawed story , with a flawed character in a flawed world but it all seems so real that you feel like you are there . it has a lot of dry , sarcasic humor which had me laughing out loud in class . mostly it 's a story about growing up and the journey of a young man discovering who he really is in a world full of phony people . i can see why this is a classic ! a warning though to those who are sensitive or easily offended : there are some sad parts and lots of foul language but without this it would not be the same story ! it 's a timeless story and i would certainly read this book again
although this book has been written almost <NUM> years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world . 'money , prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed ' . this probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more . a book to read and think about
peter drucker is a subject in and of itself . his insights into the movement of people and their actions are legendary within the business world . this book provides a clear , essential summary of his life work . if you are in business ( which is most of us ) , if you are looking for ideas , or just plain interested in who thought up some of the & quot ; common & quot ; business maps of the day , chances are you can read this book and find out that they are all linked to mr. drucker . this is not your normal biography- there is real substance here
rother and dinger parted ways for a couple of years before putting out the duo 's third release. & quot ; heros & quot ; sounds , to me like what may 've influenced gary numan 's early work. & quot ; e-musik & quot ; is a seven minute , nice hypnotic/floating track.as & quot ; after eight & quot ; progresses with it 's laid back piano and mystic like vocals more than prove that neu ! really was ahead of their time , so does & quot ; see land & quot ; . & quot ; isi & quot ; could become a hit , if played in the right clubs.dug the punk-like vocals.i always thought that that neu ! was strictly instrumental. & quot ; leb wohl & quot ; is an offbeat experimental piece that starts out with weird , but very cool sound effects , then turns into a punk song.pretty much as mind blowing as neu ! 's first album.according to the liner notes , rother plays guitar , piano , synth and electronics .. dinger provides the percussion , guitar , organ , vocals and keyboards.never has one heard so much brain damaging pleasure coming from just two musicians
there is not much to say about this album that has not been said already . it was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight , unsurpassed jagernaut that it became . it has a very timeless sound , and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end . time , money , us and them , and brain damage are my amongt my top <NUM> floyd songs of all time . if you need to own one floyd album , it should be this album . pallatable to all old fans , and to new ones .
if you like suspense and action , great plots you should watch this series . really well done . i always have a few dvd 's with me - i spend a lot of time waiting in the car while my kids are at practice ! i get boared reading so i watch videos - this one is the best !
wow - can these guys play . lukather the `` childish '' , noisy one , carlton the `` mentor '' with lots of elegance . but please : remember to buy the duo 's grammy award winning cd `` no substitutions '' produced buy steve vai and lukather . the cd is even better than the dvd . the song lists are about identical - and carlton 's solo after exactly <NUM> min.s on the cd is just ... fantastic ! ! !
the original text was written by captain charles johnson in <NUM> . in <NUM> , john robert moore announced that the real author was daniel defoe . he was so certain that he wrote a book about it ( defoe in the pillory and other studies ) . he was so convincing that most libraries/ publishers changed the cataloging . however , in <NUM> , p. n. furbank and w. r. owens proved him wrong , also in book form ( the canonisation of daniel defoe ) , based on the fact that there was n't a single piece of documentary evidence that defoe wrote the book . long story short , johnson wrote the book , not defoe
mr. gilkerson has written something wonderful here ; even <NUM> pages in and at the tender age of 40+ i was enjoying the ride . this is one fun book to read , and aside from some of the nautical terms used , seems very appropriate for an early adolescent . also , as a hobby pirate historian , i can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative . he has provided this history in what i consider to be a very engaging manner ; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally . three hundred plus pages later , i was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative . there are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader : <NUM> ) a glossary of terms , <NUM> ) a labeled image of ship rigging , and <NUM> ) a collected bibliography for further reading . in the end , those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book . my hearty thanks to william gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale . p-
a pivotal look at the development of latin american popular music , novelist alejo carpentier 's historical tract was originally published in <NUM> , and came out of raging , decades-long intellectual debates about the nature of cuban and latin american culture . this is the first english translation of this work and includes a lengthy introductory essay by the editor , explaining the author 's role in the cuban intelligensia ... & quot ; music in cuba & quot ; was an attempt to settle some of the controversies about the & quot ; legitimacy & quot ; of cuban music , and to resolve the apparent differences between tony , europhilic art music and the grittier rural style that came to dominate the island 's popular imagination . it 's an intellectual , somewhat egghead-y book , but rich in cultural depth ... the new foreward is also very valuable , giving proper context to carpentier and his work , and a sense of the academic and philosophical life of cubans abroad and at home in the early 20th century
when eleven-year-old art mumby finds out that a visitor is arriving at his run-down home , larklight , which floats in space beyond the moon , he hardly expects to be thrust into a frightening adventure of pirates , plates , and a millenium-long conflict upon which the fate of the solar system rests . he tells the story of this adventure in larklight ( occasionally giving his older sister , myrtle , a chance to narrate via her diary ) , and the story is nothing if not fantastic . philip reeve ( author of the hungry city chronicles ) has created another fascinating world in larklight . art lives in the victorian society of the <NUM> 's -- or rather , what victorian society would have looked like if they 'd developed space travel , and astronomy worked according to early speculations about aether ( an air-like substance in space that people can move and breathe in ) , and interplanetary beings ( venus , mars , and the moons of jupiter are all home to a variety of life forms ) . reeve cuts no corners , painting the cities and citizens of the solar system in dazzling detail . the setting is a gorgeous mix of fantasy and science fiction , and fans of both genres will find much to enjoy . if the world was n't exciting enough on its own , the adventure is of the edge-of-your-seat variety . art and myrtle tumble from one tense situation to another with alarming frequency . most chapters end on cliffhangers , so be prepared to have trouble finding a place to pause . reeve throws in enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing right until the end , and both art and myrtle get the chance to play hero . art , as the main character , is not yet a teen himself , so teens may find his narration a little immature for their liking . if they 're willing to give him a chance , though , they will discover that larklight is a fast-paced , imaginative journey well worth taking . reviewed by : lynn cro
this is the way more movies should be made ! it shows excellent talent , has a lot of humor and is super intertaining . and under it all are some great lessons in curtesy , honesty and ethics ! i feel good after viewing it
another beautiful album by ms. sutton and the band . their musicianship is a joy . the swingin ' , `` i 'm with the band , '' is a lot of fun
this is the best heart-felt christmas story i have seen in years . i have <NUM> copies of this and still had to watch it everytime it was on tv . awesome ! ! ! !
i was alone and in the dark when horror seeped from my speakers into my imagination . at the end of a long metal corridor is sunn o ) ) ) , a large dark orb of pain , hate and the fear of every paralyzing dream . its core spins violently like a tempest of knives but its movement toward me is slow , deliberate & inevitablelike the ocean or time or god himself ... evil in metal is increasingly difficult to represent convincingly . sunn o ) ) ) remind us that evil is not tangible , its corporal . its not a flesh eating pit fiend or something pictured on a dio cover . evil is a spirit and as a spirit is something bigger than our comprehension , and thus , our ability to stop it . therein lies its terror . there is no escape or defense from an omnipotent foe ; one not bound by physics like life in a tangible form . as such , sunn o ) ) ) do not create dungeons & dragons heavy metal . its closer to ambient music using minor keys and the sustain on a downtuned bass instead of marimbas and wind chimes . it owes as much to terry riley as toni iommi . verbs like `` lumber '' and `` plod '' used for past doom acts do n't apply here either . sunn o ) ) ) hover , glide or even wisp . omnipresent yet invisible , you 'd be no more sure it was there if you could see it . black one is truely terrifying music . it is quite possibly my most terrifying experience ever observing art . it 's reward is profound if you have the ... spirit for it
i 've used some version of this book for many years now , and i 've seen it evolve . i think , as other reviewers have said , that there are some simplified portions of the book , especially those parts dealing with monetary economics . there are other portions which lay out the principles as only these authors can , and those parts are extremely helpful and valuable . this book allows me to teach my notes and thoughts with a textbook serving as a reference and an introduction -- it does n't get in my way , in other words . i use it along with several other texts , and i think it gets the job done . students seem to like it as well , mainly for its clarity . for someone wanting to learn the basics , this is an excellent choice
this is easily in the top <NUM> of 2pac 's best cds . it is one of the best and he is still at death row
this movie is stupid . yet most of leslie neilson movies are . thats what makes them funny ! ! ! this is halarius . he does a great job on doing his part in the movie , and the last seen is the funniest you will ever see
i love this movie . bridget has a way of embarrassing me and i am not even there with her ! if you are a fan of `` pride and prejudice '' you will love this updated virgin on it . i laugh , i cried , and i am so happy i bought this dvd . the special features are true to fashion and can be more funny the the film . well done , brid ! well done
i remember seeing dan fogelberg in concert when i was about <NUM> or <NUM> years old . awesome ! after seeing him in concert , i became a fan ! the power of his music and song have deeply touched me ! everytime i hear & quot ; leader of the band & quot ; , i am moved . it 's such a heartfelt tribute to his father . every picture tells a story -- and dan tells a fine story behind each song . to sum this album in five words or less : beautiful and relaxing
for the longest time we have had this classic on vhs . at last we have upgraded . the quality is phenomenal and let 's face .... who does not love indy ? ? ? ? ?
i ordered this guide so that i could understand all of the options and functions available on my new nikon d200 . since it is a video that i could watch , pause , then continue watching it was easy for me to understand . the explanations made a lot of sense . there are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the d200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos . i highly reccommend it
like the author i can remember the books i read as a child ( with great fondness ) , i have those books even today , and like her they are my old and familiar friends . but unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction , for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world . after reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction is n't really important . for she sees books , like i imagine most readers do , as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader 's inner world at the same time as displaying the author 's world . i think the gap is between readers and nonreaders , who like those described this book as visual or picture people , identify with films rather than books . the book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds -- does it matter if i ca n't remember what is in the books ? she answers it- `` for in the end , even if all my books where to vanish , i would still have them somewhere , if i had read them attentively enough . maybe the words on the page are not even the true book , in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do . '' the book is a real treat for anyone who like her , is often asked , `` have n't you wasted your life , by reading rather than experiencing life ? '' she answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced , and so made a part of her . that it does n't matter , which is books and which is real life for they together make her , her . it 's a good book , short , poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life . go for it , spend a pleasant hour with this book
with sixteen songs , the first impression is that there 's got to be a lot of filler here . the good news is there 's nothing but perfect rolling stones songs - one after another . the stones jump around from the pondering bluesy , `` laugh , i nearly died '' to the hard paced , `` driving too fast '' and `` rain fall down '' . some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political , `` sweet neo con '' and the scathing , `` look what the cat dragged in '' . it 's all new , fresh and lively as hell . producer don was does a fantastic job getting the stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades . rock on
from the first frame the donner version is much better than lester 's . everything about donner 's superman <NUM> is far superior . this is the way superman <NUM> ahould have been . i love the turning back the world ending as opposed to the stupid and i mean stupid forget kiss of the original superman <NUM>
the bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school , overachievers , bored teachers , society , competitive people , politics , and marriages mired in ennui are all about . it 's smart , it 's incredibly funny , and it gets the most out of a very good cast . election , set in the <NUM> 's at a school outside omaha , tells the story of a frightening human dynamo , a senior who wishes to cap off her near-perfect career in high school by being elected to the student counsel presidency . as played by reese witherspoon , tracy flick ( whose last name spelled several times in the movie all in capital letters -- - '' flick '' -- -looks suggestively like another word ) sees the office as the next logical step in her sociopathic upward climb toward a full scholarship to georgetown . tracy has a single-mindedness that borders on mental illness , and a ruthlessness powered by a vicious drive that at times seems genuinely scary to behold . this uber-overachiever has been top of the honor roll for years , and has headed a number of extracurricular clubs , from being editor of the school yearbook to ... you name it . she has also destroyed the life and reputation of a teacher who grew carelessly fond of her , and before election is done she does-in another , here played by matthew broderick . broderick 's social sciences teacher , mr. mcallister , senses the destructive force tracy let loose on post-high school society might become , and he makes it his mission to sabotage her bid to become class president . first mcallister convinces the school 's dopey star athlete , played chris klein , to oppose tracy in the election , and later mcallister crosses the line and uses his position as head of the election committee to make certain tracy loses . the meltdowns that occur to several key characters in election are at times played off as funny but more than once the makers of this movie were courageous enough to let them be disturbing , particularly the scene where tracy , believing the outcome of the election has not been in her favor , breaks down emotionally , revealing the insecure , needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior . election is comedy at its smartest . the writing is polished , the delivery of these stunningly perfect lines is flawless , and the humor mixes cerebral parody with at times a fun version of crudity . it 's one of the best dark comedies of all time
credit has to go to the people behind april fool 's day . eschewing the typical slasher formula , the movie plays like an update of ten little indians . a group of college students are invited to muffy st. john 's island getaway for a weekend of fun and foolishness . the writers set up the fact that there are some practical jokers amongst them , so when real murders start , the viewer has to wonder if they are n't jokes , but they seem too real for the frightened crew , and hostess muffy has started to act like she 's missing a few raisins in her muffin . although it starts a little slowly , once it picks up , it has some neat suspenseful moments and a predictable but enjoyable climax . deborah foreman , ken olandt , amy steel , jay baker , clayton rohner and griffin o'neal head the cast , and it 's fun for a change of pace slasher/suspense flick
.......... so i do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena . i have watched them all , marcus welby right on through er . scrubs is the most realistic , albiet tongue-in-cheek representation of our professions . you can not take everything seriously , but , if you believe an emergency room can function like er 24/7 and still have people standing , you 're out of touch w/ reality as well
a great great novel ! catches you from the beginning and does n't let go . you become obsessed and engrossed . collins has the most gorgeous way of writing .... drawing you in . and his descriptive ability is astounding
song number four , ali d'oro ( wings of gold ) is a heart-stopper . wow . john lee hooker and zucchero ( singing like clapton on a really good day ) : `` i lay down with an angel , lay down thinking , more than i could , really say '' damn , this is what music is about
i just stumbled on this cd by accident in a local music store , and what a wonderful find it was . every song is a gem , the songwriting is one beautiful image after another , and the music has such depth in its sparse , seemingly simple way . every listen just opens up more and more to me . i ca n't do the scholarly , professional music review , but i will say that this cd has sent me in a very short space of time to buy a copy of every other cd of his that i can find . my beginning acquaintance with those cds just reinforces my feelings about the animal years . this is music that just calls you to sit , be still and enjoy watching in your mind a thing of beauty unfold . in a much too hectic world , it 's a thing to treasure . now i 've just got to figure out how to make it to the coast to see one of his shows .
land of hope is a very realistic book . it tells the reader about what it was like to be a russian jew traveling steerage class on a boat to ellis island . it also describes realistically what it was like to be a refuguee . this is a very good book . i would reccomend it to everyone who likes to read . tara kavaler 5th grad
every track from this rich , warm lp blows you away . everything from pete ham 's and george harrison 's slide guitars on `` day after day '' to ham 's hauntingly aching `` take it all . '' every rock and pop fan should pick this cd up before it slips out of print . badfinger initially were on the beatles ' apple records label before they moved to warner brothers in 1973/74 . every album recorded by this incredibly gifted band is worth it - `` magic christian music , '' `` no dice '' ( which ties with `` straight up '' as the best lp , `` ass , '' `` badfinger , '' `` wish you were here '' and `` head first . '' any fan of the beatles , the who , hendrix , cream/clapton and everyone else from the late 1960s/early 1970s should pick up badfinger 's discs . this was the band that rolling stone magazine said , in <NUM> , is the group `` to watch for '' in the coming years . it 's a shame their manager , s. polly , was such a thief and robbed the band of royalties and potential fame , which concluded with ham 's suicide in <NUM> and bassist tom evans ' suicide in <NUM> . drummer mike gibbons , sadly , passed away late last year , leaving only guitarist-vocalist joey molland as the band 's sole survivor . rest in peace guys ! p.s . do n't be turned off by the beatles comparisons - badfinger had a sound , song structures and style all to their own , which will please both fans of the beatles and those who do n't care for the fab four . power pop-rock was never better than the early 1970s records from badfinger . ( actually , badfinger 's output was as good as most of the solo beatles work in the early 1970s .
a well wrought , beautifully written novel . meant to be re-read several times
george orwell , writer of such great classics as & quot ; no winston , two plus two is five & quot ; and & quot ; all animals are equal & quot ; truely outdid himself with this book . his essay , & quot ; such , and such were the joys , & quot ; is worth the price of the book alone . the descriptions therein , in the vein of <NUM> , are detailed and vivid to the point where i almost feel as if i remember and understand orwell 's childhood better than my own . in this essay one also catches a glimpse of what made orwell the writer he was : a poor , pessimistic , sickly lad whose talent could have created it 's own entire cannon if he 'd lived longer and enjoyed a more work conducive atmosphere . for every reader who breathes to read , this book is an oxygen tank . ( like the one they have at the bottom of the slopes in aspen .
i am about half way through the book and i have been greatly encouraged by it . when i am feeling down and read it it gives me some renewed strength . i am personally a realist and reality can get you down . i am from katrina ville which has been mentally challenging . it was hard loosing our home , business location and a lot of friends . although i was fully insured and we are doing well the realization that you can loose it all so fast is depressing . so many that have gone through it are not even as fortunate as i am . so many around the world would love to trade places with me . i am reading this one slowly and trying to absorb as much as i can . joel osteen has been able to reach me with his positive message when others just could n't . i want to read it again when i am finished
i have been a sci-fi/fantasy reader for over <NUM> years . this book blew me away . the characters were `` fully fleshed out . '' the plot , which would have come off as inane in less capable hands , resonates with , well , reality . that 's it ! emma bull got me to buy in to this story line - with all the `` diversity '' in the fey - and yes ! it works . i enjoyed it . i loved the love story of eddi and the phouka . all in all , a great , fun read . what more can you ask for
opinions are like noses : everyone has one . some like it , some do n't . let me say this , however , in defense of this <NUM> movie starring robin williams as popeye . it is certainly unfair to say , by any stretch , that this is 'the worst movie of all-time ' , or 'one of the worst ... ' . it is funny how , at the time of this writing , that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars ... actually that is about right . for those who do not know about the wonderful website called the internet movie database ( imdb.com ) , you really need to check it out . [ ... ] my point is this : there are many opinions . so if you have never seen this movie , decide for yourself . do you remember the incredible muttering popeye ( done by jack mercer on the cartoons ) ? . i 'm talking especially about the early fleischer studios popeye cartoons from the <NUM> 's . you know , the ones in black-and-white . that 's what i loved the most , the muttering popeye . well , robin williams does it superbly ! also , shelly duvall is excellent as olive oyl in this movie . granted , the story is kind of bland . the music is not always top notch . yes , it is too long . however , i enjoyed watching robin williams ' masterful portrayal of everyone 's favorite sailor man . sure , olive can get a little annoying at times , but was n't she basically that way in the cartoons ? so if you loved the muttering popeye , then you 'll love the movie , overall . never mind the story . the storyline does n't really matter , i feel . but , alas , you say you can not really remember those vintage popeye cartoon shorts too well . not to worry ! they are scheduled to be released on dvd ... fully restored ! ! ! volume <NUM> ( <NUM> - <NUM> ) , with a july <NUM> scheduled release , will have , in my opinion , the very best of all the <NUM> total popeye cartoon shorts . ( incidently , william costello provided popeye 's voice from <NUM> until sometime in <NUM> . he was very good also , but the really great muttering came when jack mercer took over in <NUM> ) . by all means , if you are a huge popeye fan like myself , then you absolutely must get these dvds . after listening to the great jack mercer , and watching the incredible animation in those early years , then compare popeye to robin williams ' version . i dare say , you will see the similarity . so , the bottom line is : see for yourself . if you love popeye , the character , then you will not be disappointed with robin williams ' performance . the movie itself ... well , you be the judge . likely you have a nose , so without a doubt you , too will have an opinion . it 's all alright .
i have always been quite a hard core indie fan . i cam across my first otis redding song 'try a little tenderness ' when i was watching the 80s teen flick , pretty in pink . it struck me as being one of the most emotional , moving and captivating song i had heard in a long time . it caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me . i would like to say thank you to otis redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music , and for creating this incredible album . as someone said before , it is a shame we lost him at such a young age as he had such a unique talent , but i am thankful his music remains to keep his memory forever
one of the missing components to the concept of teaching `` social skills '' to children and young adults on the autism spectrum , is that instructors focus on textbook manners instead of teaching real life practical knowledge . the hidden curriculum explains that every society has unstated rules , the things that no one explains to you , but which you are supposed to pick up somehow on your own . remember how awkward and geeky most of us were in jr. high ? and there were always the `` cool kids '' who somehow knew just how to dress , just what to say and meanwhile you ( and i ) were clueless ? it 's because they understood the unstated rules , they had an unkanny ability to pick up the exact tools necessary for `` coolness . '' as we grow up , we learn better how to adapt to social situations , we know how to behave in a variety of settings , even perhaps cross culturally . adults grow into a sense of ease in our surroundings , we know what we are supposed to do . now , imagine that you never got over that awkward phase , you were perpetually spending your life roaming around trying to figure out the world with little to go on . no one pulled you aside and explained , `` this is how it is , kid . '' that 's exactly what it 's like for our kids on the spectrum . well , here comes the hidden curriculum to the rescue ! not only does it explain many of these `` unstated rules '' ( many of which are humorous -- who does n't know you should take tuna in your school lunch because it stinks ? many of our as kids ! ) it also goes beyond to explain how to uncover them . it highlights how crucial it is for us as parents , as educators and just as a society to literally pull our as folks aside and say , `` these are the rules . '' for example , `` do n't pick your nose . '' good advice right ? but p-leeeze , everybody picks their nose ! ( okay , not me , but everybody else ! : - ) what we really need to teach our kids is not , do n't pick your nose , but not to pick their nose where people can see them . sound silly ? our children and friends on the autism spectrum just need for us to teach them one little tidbit like this every day and they 'll find their way with increasing ease . and would n't you have liked someone to pull you aside in jr. high and done the same for you ? let 's equip our kids with the real skills to make their way in the world . the hidden curriculum does just that !
i was never a big fan of bruce springsteen growing up - i was a `` tweener '' when `` born in the usa '' came out and for some reason his music just never appealed to me . however , this album is so different from his other stuff i 've heard ( which i completely admit is limited experience ) and more like the music i typically like - folksy , bluesy , a bit of bluegrass , just so many things you can not put it into a box . love it
great book , easy to read . lots of information about different hair types and braiding tips . step-by-step instruction on braiding techniques and braiding styles for all age groups and ethnic backgrounds . if you 're into hair cosmetology this is a must have .
another review of a govi cd that i should have submitted years ago . this cd opened my ears and mind to a whole new spectrum of guitar based music that caused me spend big $ $ $ $ to upgrade my mid-fi stereo system to high end ; a decision that i 'll never regret . maybe better than any other govi release , this cd showcases the widest range of his immense musical talents . the softly played songs are full , detailed , open , and introspective while `` viva la vida '' makes me feel like i am riding a galloping horse , in the southwest desert , at full speed while enjoying a day of playing hookey from work . the end result of this fullfilling music is not only the great sound but the warm/happy feelings that the music generates . george m -- phoenix , az
this is a great resource for quoting those little sound bites in a design presentation that can really help take the subjectivity out of color choices . a `` must '' for the design studio
we are so conditioned to the fix put on the left by the leninist tradition that we forget the crucial role of the left in the 'forging of democracy ' as recounted in this history in a 'slow but steady ' account that accumulates telling detail . once there were liberals who were n't democrats and then the left , in the wake of the failures of <NUM> , proceeded to the course corrections we now take for granted , no thanks to the liberals who were n't democrats , now democrats , by name at least , denouncing socialism by a leninist standard where the term was a demand for real democracy .
passion , a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders ( including chris tomlin , charlie hall , matt redman and david crowder ) released hymns ancient & modern in <NUM> . there is some interpretation of the hymns , and a couple have a chorus added to them , but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes . to `` o worship the king , '' for example , chris tomlin adds the chorus , `` you alone are the matchless king / to you alone be all majesty / your glories and wonders , what tongues can recite ? / you breathe in the air , you shine in the light . '' some of the standouts on this album are `` the solid rock , '' `` all hail the power of jesus ' name , '' and `` all creatures of our god and king . '' the liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author . it is quite a good album if you enjoy the `` passion '' sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them
witnesses to freedom focuses on the efforts and dedication of young african-americans during the civil rights movement . the stories of protesters as young as nine years old are narrated as well as told through the eyes of the young freedom fighters . this book highlights not only the more famous young activists that students may not have exposure to , but many young people who did both big and small things to help make the movement . for example , the book opens with a story about barbara johns , a teenager who led a movement in her school to boycott for better educational facilities and resources . the book also tells the stories of more famous teenagers like elizabeth eckford who integrated little rock 's all white central high , and claudette colvin who was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white person on a montgomery bus months before rosa park 's famous arrest . while the book highlights specific individuals , the stories place a strong emphasis on the importance of group participation for social change . each young activist was working to inspire others to join the cause , and make the movement truly powerful . photographs are also included of the young activists which adds a personal touch to their stories of struggle and survival . this book would be an excellent book to introduce students to the struggle and inspire them to want to learn more about the history of african-americans . the emphasis on the power of young people to make social change makes this book an excellent resource for children . this book would be best suited for older children ages <NUM> and <NUM> . the book is written in a more mature format , and covers more mature subject matter
i did n't love everything about this film . in fact , the first time i saw it , i felt it was lacking in depth . but the second time i watched it , many little moments shone through and i saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed . first , payton 's performance as andrew really hit a few times . when he first starts warming up to christian ( as christian grows more confident ) by responding to christian 's teasing , i thought this was some complex and genuine emotions . there 's a great `` you bitch , okay , let me see that '' moment . second , i liked aaron 's genuineness when bisset 's character is suffering and he knows he does n't have anything to make her feel good . i also like the fact that he put bisset 's character 's needs ahead of his own agenda of converting people . finally , i thought the best moment was between aaron and his mom ( mary kay place ) as place 's character begins to comprehend the suffering of her son and begins to get past her prejudices . after my second viewing , i fell in love with the film . worth owning .
one only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that , if gross 's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between jews and poles , he has utterly failed . unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles , this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred , freshening the pot . readers without a more complete history of both the jews and the poles are especially at risk . jan karski 's `` story of a secret state '' which was actually written during world war <NUM> and deals with the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this . additional reading should include a comprehensive review of polish-jewish relations , beginning with the charters of sanctity responsible for so many jews living in poland in the first place . when jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout europe , the poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland , where they thrived for many centuries . the lutheran armies of the swedish invasions brought anti-semitism . later , poland was divided by germany , russia ( with a german queen ) , and austria , an occupation which lasted for more than a century . these countries waged a cultural war on the occupied poles , determined to convert them to their own . the poland of ww2 had only been liberated for a few decades . the equivalent of ronald reagan 's era to today . many of the citizens were of german descent and actually aided the nazis in their fight against other poles , not only jews . and although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable , one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression , poverty and terror . we 've seen similar episodes in recent years in the balkans and africa and elsewhere . even the israeli human rights organization b'tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected israelis today . poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades , after two hundred years of occupation . pope john paul <NUM> was emblematic of that spirit , and poland 's support for israel and attempts to honor her jewish heritage , embraced by her youth of today , are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past . the poland that was once a mighty power , yet never imperialistic . the poland that was the promised land for jews in the middle ages
hmm , i 've got ta disagree with the reviewer who rated this just another funk band with some scratching . kid koala takes a lead role in this band , and is not relegated to some background scratching as is often the case . the integration of the turntables is also far beyond what you might normally hear . this is n't a group where the dj takes a break to show off his funky beats , kid koala meshes his skills seamlessly with the rest of the band . to top it off the vocals are superb , straight out of the congregation . this band is up there with the best of the new hip hop/soul/funk ( breakestra , dakah , and medusa )
remember the hollywood blacklist ? the hollywood ten ? i 'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you were n't alive in the 1950s . that 's because tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive . it was the era of the red scare , of senator joseph mccarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in west virginia . it was the time of congressional investigations , a time when invoking the fifth amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye . for a select few the mccarthy era was a time of great fear , and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than hollywood . why ? because , despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years , the movie industry oozed communists . there were so many reds in hollywood that they should have renamed the town little moscow . yet even today , you wo n't hear about this truth in the media . you will , however , get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of ronald radosh 's `` red star over hollywood : the film colony 's long romance with the left . '' talk about exploding myths ! radosh 's book , which he co-wrote with his wife allis , cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real hollywood of the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s . vladimir lenin , the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of marxism to the soviet union back in the early part of the twentieth century , had a soft spot for film and theater . he believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays . this is exactly what the kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades . they managed to gain converts to their cause -- men who later became movers and shakers like budd schulberg , joseph losey , and maurice rapf -- by allowing them to work closely with the soviet film industry . once these people came back to the united states , they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks willi munzenberg , v.j . jerome , and john howard lawson . in no time at all , writes radosh , a branch of the communist party flourished in hollywood . so many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry , in an attempt to make contacts and find work , had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves . the hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways . one of the most successful methods involved the tried and true `` united frontism '' and `` popular front '' techniques , or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes . radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of national socialist germany in the 1930s helped increase membership , although the party 's propensity to change direction , oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the kremlin , tended to alienate many members . also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time . albert maltz , for example , discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed `` revisionist '' by the upper hierarchy . his very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes . despite the ugliness the hollywood reds occasionally displayed , they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like `` mission to moscow , '' `` the spanish earth , '' and `` the north star . '' congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer , and silenced a few more , but many never repudiated their warped views . i enjoyed radosh 's book , the first one of his i 've had the chance to read . the author and his spouse obviously know what they 're talking about and , since ronald radosh himself was a communist for many years , he understands how these groups think and act . `` red star over hollywood '' occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals , but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes . for instance , the part where we learn about ronald reagan ( at the time a liberal ) and his buddy william holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about . reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes . god bless him ! the account of albert maltz 's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling , a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism . arguably the best part of the book , however , involves the long , strange trip writer dalton trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life . so many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat . i have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book . in the case of the former , if you 're not very familiar with this time period , read a background history of the red scare first . doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist . in the case of the latter , the topic is so huge that radosh does n't have the space to cover many of the important reds . there is almost nothing here about lillian hellman or dashiell hammett , for example , and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books . nevertheless , this book is well worth your time . read it and remember it the next time hollywood releases yet another `` we were innocent '' propaganda piece .
this book is a great read ! i really enjoyed all of the tips and hints that dave gives throughout . as a team in training member i thought i had learned a lot , but after reading dave 's book i really added a lot to my bag of tricks . if you are serious about doing a marathon this book is a definite must
this book is one of the best i 've ever read . i rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but i just could n't stop reading . mr. richardson starts by explaining the culture of the yali tribe , then moves to the life and background of stan dale . seeing the providence of god at work as the third part brings the yali tribe and stan dale together is remarkable . stan dale 's conviction , comittment , and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the gospel of jesus christ
well , this album is pretty terrible , but i like it anyway . if you 're looking for an album to get you into modest mouse , then this definitely is n't it . anyone else who would want it probably already has it .
quentin tarrantino promised us a `` horror film for horror fans . '' he lied . it 's not scary , it 's not suspenseful , but it is a fun movie . i got ta say , the first half is really , really good , but it gets a little lame when the vampires show up , but it 's still one of those movies you can watch over and over .
with the slew of well known asian films from the likes of kurosawa , tsui hark , ect . it is easy to overlook these precious gems known as the zatoichi series . truly incredible , shintaro katsu owns this role and plays the part so damned well you 'd swear he must have walked around every day of his life carrying a cane sword and pretending to be blind . the swordplay scenes are some of the greatest i have ever witnessed and i 've seen it all . they are so realistic and provide a nice counterpoint to the frantic flying wirework approach of the chinese . if you are a fan of japanese cinema you owe it to yourself to see these films . i guarantee you will be utterly captivated from start to finish
it is a great book for young ones to learn about shapes . my <NUM> months old son is not in to shapes yet but i will use this book onces he learns about shapes . buy this book if your toddler already can recognize the shapes and can sit with you while you read this book . it is a activity book .
i loved this movie from the moment i saw it for sale at my video store 's discard rack ten years ago . i recently received the dvd as a gift and the sound quality is a big improvement over my old vhs copy . i recommend it for performances , the story and the photography . jodie foster 's monologue toward the end of the film is particularly memorable . each girl 's story line is realistic and the film itself does a good job of capturing teen life in the late 70s before yuppie values took hold . this is not a john hughes film and is a refreshing change for anyone who was subjected that director 's teen films in the 80s
when it comes to the great classics of anime history , there are a few that stand out . anime like gundam and macross , the genre known as mecha . these shows are known for their drama , romance , intrigue , beautiful animation , classic musical scores , and giant humanoid robots who 's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil . shoji kawamori 's classic macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys mecha sagas , delivering all the required elements in huge way . shoji kawamori is a genius , whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics . why do i mention this ? because in addition to macross he created escaflowne ... what is escaflowne ? it is quite frankly , the greatest television show i have ever seen in my life . it is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector . it is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that 's a cross between medieval europe and the asian/middle eastern regions . it is a story of an ordinary girl named hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior , her destiny intertwined with its heros . it is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction . it is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight , a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom , a cute cat-girl , princesses , merchants , villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters . and of course , the giant stone mecha that could save the world ... or perhaps destroy it ... if there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show , this is it . there is character development ( like the perfect knight who has a hidden past , or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother ) , an incredible plot ( the lost people of atlantis , an engine which can alter fate , and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness ) , super-cool technology ( like the coolest mecha i have ever seen anywhere , the guymelefs ) , heart-warming ( or is it heart-wrenching ? ) romance ( complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing ) , action sequences to die for ( giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords ! ! ! invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons ! dragons ! ! ! ) , and characters that are very deep indeed ( hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story ) . although many people prefer japanese to english in their anime , this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch , with great performances all-around . the standout though , is probably the voice of folken [ played to perfection by paul dobson ] ( the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck , and one scene had me ready to cry ) . the animation and art is also quite glorious , featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of gundam wing , but with better use of color and far more complex and beautiful backgrounds . i must say that the soundtrack of escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted . i currently have <NUM> cds of the music ( and i plan to buy the others one day ) , and i listen to it a lot . yoko kanno 's score for this anime could best be likened to some of john william 's best ( as it has hints of john williams ' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion , as well as choral chants for key moments ) . take the piece `` dance of curse '' for instance . it reminds one a lot of `` duel of the fates '' , but it came out first , and personally i think it 's better . played only twice during the entire show , it 's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted . and i havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the incredible theme that ends the last episode . in the end , escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic . it 's directed as well ( or better ) than the best movies of hollywood history ( using dramatic angles and the like ) , and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again . one of the few negative points i can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl merle can be a little annoying at times ( especially toward the beginning of the series ) . but by the end of the series , i do n't think there was a single character that i did n't love . i also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode `` mystic eyes '' . it does n't go with the whole theme of the series , and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears . believe it or not , for all its glorious ideas and execution , this show also has no filler ! originally , it was to be a <NUM> episode show like macross . so when it was cut down to <NUM> episodes , the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that 's told . and ultimately , it 's the story that matters most . as i watched this show for the first time i found myself addicted to its world , in love with its characters , awestruck with it 's beauty , and enraptured with its music . the ideas though , were what made me decide this is the greatest tv show i have ever seen . in this show you will see fate altered , armies nuked , people who are half animal , creatures that can shape-shift , and even an incredible sequence where hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm . when i had finished escaflowne my mind was full of questions . what if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate ? does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means ? and what of the escaflowne guymelef ? why was it built ? just how powerful could it ultimately become ? to this day i am fascinated by the transformation that van goes through , and i keep asking myself if the escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil . maybe someday i 'll know . until then i 'll have to satisfy myself with ... escaflowne .
its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a <NUM> star average . this is quality thrash metal right here , with a slightly refined sound to it . all the songs have blistering solos , crazy as hell riffs , and of course , paul bostaphs inhuman drumming , which brings me to another a point . paul bostaph is just as good as dave lombardo you f-ing retards ! ! ! ! ! ! get it through your f-ing skulls . sorry , i had to get that out . but seriously , just listen to the crazy intro to killing fields , his crazy pummeling in dittohead , and his double bass madness in ss-3 . this is slayer , quality slayer , and all the b-chin needs to stop . im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it , like the retards reviewing trivium and unearth . if your like those sepultura and anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s , than so be it . your loss . as for me , my favorite tracks are killing fields , ss-3 , mind control , <NUM> , and dittohead . if my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change , get diabolus in musica , this , and god hates us all . also get some of pauls work with exodus , forbidden , and testament if you need further proof of his excellency
true story about racial problems not just in us but all over the world.kamal said that that movie should be seen by every one on the world.it is true and nothing but the true.shout out goes to turk , gujo , janc , kolach and my main man icho. ! ! ! ! stay black ! ! ! !
after working in a church in boston and another in washington , d.c. , minister ed wilcox and his family have transferred to the consolidated community church in emerald springs , ohio . his wife , aggie , initially has her doubts about settling down in a small town , but eventually she , ed , and their two young children find themselves making friends , except for elderly parishioner gelsey falowell who despises ed and wants to get rid of him . gelsey 's wish may come true when the naked body of a murder victim is left on the wilcox 's front porch and ed , who had been counseling the dead woman , is the chief suspect . aggie knows that ed is innocent but wonders why ed is keeping secrets from her especially when her daughter teddy tells her she saw her father fighting with the dead woman . when a second murder is committed and detective kirkor roussos seems to suspect ed committed both crimes , aggie , with the help of her friend , real estate agent lucy jacobs , begins investigating the murders . the more aggie looks into the crimes the more she realizes that people , especially gelsey , have secrets that have been buried for years and some people will kill to have them remain secret . `` blessed is the busybody '' is a good beginning to what looks to be a good mystery series . the characters are well written and well defined . the mystery is written from the view point of aggie , revealing various bits of her unconventional childhood , plus her struggles to raise her children especially oldest daughter deena , who at eleven is just starting to rebel a little bit . both teddy and deena are well written and come across as real children . aggie 's friend lucy is so well written that i could picture here while reading the book . ed comes across as a bit bland , but i suspect that will change in future books . author emilie richards does a good job describing small town life and the secrets hidden there and the town itself was like a character in the book . the mystery is well written with plenty of surprising secrets slowly revealed as the book goes on . the mystery is complex yet satisfying , if a bit sad . but there 's a nice gentle humor throughout the book that takes the edge off the sadder elements . `` blessed is the busybody '' is well worth reading .
there 's very little enjoyable as seeing the brandenburg 's put on by a live group of musicians . switched-on is the antithesis of that experience : a work completed in the studio with extensive dubbing . yet , hearing this again , after so many years , is a reminder of bob moog 's analog synthesizer and wendy carlos ' comprehensive application . carlos did not show how to compose for the synthesizer , the way stockhausen and subotnick had . this was exclusively a study in tone-shaping and arranging for synthesizer . bach , an organ master , would have been the first person to test-drive moog 's creations had he been alive . analog synths sound more organic than digital ones , and moog 's are distinctive even in that category . [ if you are looking for carlos ' interpretation of beethoven 's 9th , for a clockwork orange , that music is unfortunately not included in this set .
i love saving jane and the songs off this album are greeat ! it 's flippin awesome times a gazillion , a must buy ! saving jane rocks , no doubt ! & lt ; <NUM>
i never get tired of listening to this cd , and i like all of the songs on it . his lyrics are so weird and interesting . the music is so original . great anywhere ... in the car , cleaning the house , during a party , working out , etc
this dvd contains quintessential monty python skits , with spam all over the place . but , this review focuses on one skit on this dvd , which is the skit that made me laugh more than anything else i 've ever seen . the hungarian phrasebook is skit is basic on a simple premise : hungarian immigrants to england need english translations of basic phrases needed in everyday life . but , sinister forces are afoot , and a not-so-innocent phrasebook is published . the skit shows the devastating effects of this nefarious deed , as john cleese portrays a proper hungarian gentleman going into a tobacconist 's shop and . . . i do n't what to spoil it . but , the end result had me laughing until i cried . * da dolphin boy ponders a similar dolphin-human phrasebook , but rejects the idea as potentially fatal to human-cetacean relations
it is written from heart . there are lot of stories , real life events and observations . the single theme is god is love . in strict theological terms , it is vedantic or zen buddhist kind . in the chapter on undoing unworthiness , he rejects the sinner concept of christanity . there are lot of page length poems of deep meaning . there are some interesting diagrams . it is a book one can read again and again atleast parts of it . discussion on jesus in the chapter dancin ' up the path is interesting . it reminds capras 's urge to equate siva 's dance and quantum vibrations
the hetty wainthroop series is a very special treat for my wife and i . we lived in england for six years with the united states air force and truly appreciate english productions . patricia routledge is an outstanding actress and this particular series truly brings out the best in her career -- -- a great investment
i can not rave enough about this book ; certainly i have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time . gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical , sometimes heartbreaking , always intelligent , fresh , and full of magic . clarke 's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read . one always has the sense that she 's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love ( or hate ! ) them . the story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing . allow yourself to be lost in her world !
i purchased this movie for my <NUM> year old grandson . this is a perfect age for this movie . he has watched it over and over again . it is not so simplistic that he gets bored and is very entertaining and funny . parents can at least watch it once without getting bored . i highly recommend it
i do n't want to call anyone silly , or a thief for pirating movies , ( just look at the reviews , you 'll find him ) but just so everyone ( and certainly someone in particular ) who complains about this columbia dvd not being widescreen understands , this move was never made in widescreen ! the first widescreen movie in america was `` the robe '' , released in <NUM> . do a little research before you start bashing film noir ( minor ) classics like this bogart picture . there were no widescreen movies before <NUM> ! now as for this dvd . i thought the transfer showed very little wear . all-in-all columbia did a very nice job here of cleaning up the print . my only complaint with columbia is how pricey they seem to think their dvd movies are . still , this is a good pot-boiler drama , and bogart is the best . i can leave or take lizabeth scott in this role as the femm fatalle , another leading lady might 've been better ; she 's not a bad actress , i just prefer a lot of other leading ladies of that time period ; she does have a certain bad girl sex-appeal that helps her performance . if you 're not familiar with the story , bogart plays rip murdock , an ex-g.i . returning from the war who suddenly finds himself trying to clear his war-buddy of a murder rap , and then solve his friends murder . bogarts character tangles with the dark underworld , mixing it up with killers and a lovely blonde . this movie has a nice , dark feel to it . not as dark as say , `` in a lonely place '' ( also columbia ) , but still very nice . i liked this film enough to put out the money , and if you are an honest person who loves old bogey pictures , then you 'll put out the money as well . do all of us honest people a favor , do n't help drive up the cost of dvds by supporting pirating like some other goofball suggests . you will never get as good a digital copy by burning your own , unless you 're willing to do two things : buy the most expensive digital recorder you can find , and drop any integrity you have into the ditch to steal a copy
x-men , x-men united and x-men `` the last stand '' are simply spectacular ! the cast , the characters , the special effects , the story , the action scenes , and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever ! ! ! .i have seen lots of movies in my life , but nothing compares and comes close to x-men .
got this when it came out and gave it a read . three years have passed and i just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology . the details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything . if you are about the web and doing business , this is worth the bucks and time
starts off slow but makes up for it in the end . it is a really great story . val kilmer does a great job ( as usual )
excellent music for evening reading and study . in addition , it is also prefect for evening cuddling . should not miss this collection
i 've been doing this workout for several months , and it 's still challenging ! but everytime i do it , i feel invigorated and strong ! basic kickboxing moves are repeated and built upon , and the instructors ' explicit descriptions ensure that each move is done properly and effectively . and her accent is pretty cool ! legs/butt , arms/shoulders , cardio/aerobics , and abs are all covered ... the perfect well-rounded workout ! highly recommneded !
it 's not a book based on plot or persuasion ; merely a book which presents incredible feelings and ideas in a fantastic way . often we have all wondered about the true nature of simply being . often we feel as though the world passes us by , or hunts us , or seeks to confuse us . pessoa simply puts these feelings into beautifully flowing prose . complex ideas and feelings are written of so skillfully that i feel as if we had been the same person . this book is well worth reading
this book is entertaining . it is not as enthralling like other books sheldon has written such as the conspiracy theory , the stars shine down or nothing lasts forever . i found myself bored at times when reading this and then in a & quot ; ca n't put it down & quot ; mode at other times . if you are a sheldon fan , it is worth reading , but if you are new to this author try a different title first . he is an exceptional story teller
1970s suburbian life style is the setting of this compelling novel . this story follows the lives and drama surrounding a small town where four beautiful girls try to break free of their strict parents in very sinful ways . the book is narrated by a small groups of boys who become bewitched and pulled into the drama of these young girls lives . i absolutely love this book it was so real and full of heart and sisterly honour . that may not sound so great to those who understand the kind of honour these girls have with one anothers but its a wonderful novel that isnt for the faint at heart . it hits hard into a common death and problem among young girls and young boys
i remember hearing all about this concert in moscow when i was a kid . whatever i thought - so some old guy played in mosocw . well , reader you must forgive me for my stupidity , because for some time i realize the greatness of maestro horowitz , and the importance of his playing in moscow , his hometown and homeland after <NUM> years . i bought this album because i remember the hoopla in <NUM> . i was not dissapointed . the playing is emotional and incredible . horowitz really was an amazing piano player - the ability to hold rapture over the audience is captured here . those fingers -connected to a difficult , sole-eating , slight , russian man - were magic . wow . those beautiful notes he plays hold in the air like ripe fruit . a master at work ! this was an inspired performance by a magician on the ivories . if your wondering what the fuss was about , or you want a cd that expresses how classical music can move the soul - then i recommend this cd very highly . along with the three tenors in concert , it just has some inherent quality to move you . horowitz may have made better studio recordings , and better live recordings , but i am convinced this is just a good . i join along with the gentleman who can be heard yelling `` bravo '' at the conclusion of several pieces . bravo !
graffiti bridge is a great movie , one of prince greatest movies , if you like purple rain ! give graffiti bridge a try , you wont regret it , i have it on dvd : )
if you were wondering why so many musicians and critics ( and fans ) think so highly of joni mitchell 's work , or if you 've heard a few songs and would like to hear a broader sampling , dreamland is the answer . it offers the heyday pop hits ( free man in paris , help me ) some early folky touchstones , ( big yellow taxi , circle game ) , a selection from the fantastic jazz-rock masterpiece hejira ( furry sings the blues ) , a delightful 80s comedy-drama with billy idol and tom petty in guest roles ( dancin ' clown ) and much more , including some late career orchestral reinventions of earlier songs ( amelia , both sides now ) . dreamland is a delicious taste of the diverse and delightful joni mitchell catalog .
the sweet shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to rock . from the first <NUM> seconds of track one `` set me free '' for good or bad , you know those days are gone for ever . in the process they acquire an entirely new audience . the sweet have attained their adolescence . although they do not have total control ( yet ) of the final product , they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest . this gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product . as adolescents , gone is the `` goodie two-shoes '' image . the topics now range from fast cars ( rebel rouser ) to bi-sexual women ( ac-dc ) . in the <NUM> 's the `` moral majority '' still ruled over freedom of expression , so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour . oh yes the music ... i could decipher the music for pages but i 'll let you do it . someone once wrote that sweet was a fly by night , <NUM> chord churning and `` very limited talent wise '' band . alright then `` smarty pants '' , compare pat benatar 's cover of the song `` no you do n't '' to the original sweet version . compare the drums , guitar and vocals . then you can make-up your own mind ... great stuff ! ! ! an excellent deal with all those extra tracks .
wow ! i had no idea that people could be so close-minded and prejudiced -- and about a movie for crying out loud ! i mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie . and this from a reviewer who called this movie racist -- talk about hypocrite ! quite frankly , i thought this movie was hilarious . the acting is supposed to be life-less . the movie is supposed to be uneventful . but if you pay attention to the nuances , the slight glances , you might understand a bit more . for instance , when napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in , he does so with the utmost care and then , he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed . for all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $ <NUM> an hour . now who ca n't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario ? i am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you do n't , either you are a literal or figurative thinker , either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear . the point is you do n't have to like this movie . no one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee ! you also do n't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it . liking this movie does not mean i do n't like other more classic/mainstream comedies . young frankenstein , the birdcage , the producers , the wedding singer etc are all great movies and great comedies . napoleon dynamite is just one more that some people in enjoy . so lighten up
i am thrilled with this book . it is clear , concise , and thorough . i 'm totally excited to make all the slopers to begin creating my own library of designs . content-wise the only drawbacks is that it 's mostly based on standard form sizes . they do give directions about how to measure the body and the drafting itself is pretty simply explained so either measurements can be used . also , there are n't instructions about collars or cuffs or button/zipper extensions which , granted , are not really necessarily drafted by measurements . but you do need a supplemental flat pattern making book for those items . the only real cons i can tell are the publisher 's fault - not the author 's . the book is rather skinny for the price - i too was expecting a monster text . should have known better - its a textbook right ? so of course they gouge the student . shameless really . on top of it , it is rather cheaply done - the pages look like photocopies ! also , one reviewer mentioned that it came with the neckline tool - i did n't get one ! now i have to scour the internet to find a replacement because they do n't have directions about how to draft a neckline . my only real annoyance .
the lilting prose and alternating black-and-white and colorful illustrations make this one of my favorite books to read to my little one . there is a reason this book is a classic
if you need to buy a gift for a kid from ages 3-93 , hook is a good movie to purchase . it was great seeing robin williams and dustin hoffman battling it out in neverland .
the book is beautifully produced . the quilts in the show are well documented and photographed . i received the book promptly and in excellent condition
the word & quot ; classic & quot ; , in my opinion , has been way over used in describing noted records.but if there ever was one , this is it ! janis ' best and one of rock n'rolls best.the right songs , the right band and janis.timeless.full tilt boogie really took these songs where the ( pretty lousy ) big brother never could have.if janis had lived , the sky would 've been the limit.her heart and soul in every song.a truly great work .
one of the most wonderful things about rabbi kushner 's writings is that he is n't afraid to tackle the hard questions . if we indeed have a shepherd , why is n't he doing a better job ? to this question , kushner says , `` the psalmist would teach us to see the world , without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen , but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy this is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom . drawing on the individual lines of the twenty-third psalm , rabbi kushner ( known best for his book why bad things happen to good people ) creates <NUM> essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring . he outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm , noting `` the earliest ancestors of the hebrew people who gave us the bible were nomads , owning no property , bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on . '' the analogy of god to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment . the beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today . the image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge . ed by the things that do happen . '' kushner is skilled at relating biblical literature to questions and concerns of today . he relates the verse to terrorists , einstein and daily living . he provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively . his words also provide hope to all of us : `` you may have to work hard to earn your living ... but you do n't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself . all you have to do is stop striving , relax , and say to yourself , i feel good about who i am . '' this slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come . it 's a book i will come back to again and again for wisdom , courage and peace
i must admit that i have never been a boyzone fan and quite fankly i found ronan 's solo efforts rather dull , so when a friend lent me a copy of boyzone member stephen gately 's debut solo cd i was rather skeptical . i was pleasantly surprised . this cd is filled with wonderful pop sounds and stephen 's sweet singing voice is used to full effect here . with several tracks cowritten by stephen himself , the lyrics are basically dealing with his coming-out . a wonderful cd - i throughly recommend it
i read the book on a flight from phoenix to denver with time to spare . the chapters are well organized and the material is reinforced to the reader by the use of worksheets and a self-test . though the depth of each of the topics covered is not extensive , the scope of the topics and the logical way they are presented allow the reader to develop a good grasp of the gist of project management . i am looking to make this book a mandatory read for employees going through our company 's project management curriculum
flip the switch is an excellent book . i 'm <NUM> and tired of being overweight . i bought this book months ago . i read half of it , then moved from seattle to valdez , alaska . all the while i was moving , i could not stop thinking about this book . as soon as my shipment arrived , i found the book asap and finished it . i have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books . i look at it this way : spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $ 10.00 for a resistance rope - plus - you get to do this in the privacy of your home . this is a great idea , especially for women that have children , a job and the home to contend with . jim karas was overweight for several years . he can relate to me . he revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because i simply can not handle cardio workouts due to a bad back . the running and `` stepping '' in cardio is too much for me . this is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience
this is one of the best books ever .... i noted that a women said that we complain about racism in this country and do not truly understand what discriminate is ... i am grasping that she was european america ( i.e . white ethnic , white , fair skinned whatever you want to call it ) .... i ask you this have your people ever been inslaved for nearly <NUM> years , have your people ever had attempts of racial/cultural genocides ... is it deeply ingrained in society that your people are lazy , inferior intellectually , etc .... you would not even begin to understand , typical white person syndrome ... do n't walk around stupid your whole life .... fyi ... this is just the tip of the iceberg , i would love to intellectually cruise your stupid ideals , you do n't begin to know sufferings ... continue to read some books and maybe you can something from them ..
while i 'm normally not a huge country fan , i enjoyed this album greatly . the songs had , for the most part , a southern-rock feel , rather than a warbly cowboy tone . the version of & quot ; amazing grace , & quot ; done as a jam session with a huge group of famous musicians , was worth the price of the tape alone ! : c
this is a very delightful bit of silliness . do you remember how visually wonderful `` chicken run '' was ? well , this is even better . wallace is a daft inventor who , in this story , is running a humane pest removal service named `` anti-pesto '' and gromit is his intelligent and loyal dog . gromit is the one with the common sense and is the only one in the whole film who seems to know what is going on . and gromit never says a word . however , he is quite expressive and we always know clearly what is on his mind and why he has the concerns he has . the town is concerned about the rabbits eating their vegetable gardens because the annual giant vegetable growing contest is about to be held . the sponsor is a local hereditary heir , lady tottington ( wonderfully voiced by helena bonham carter ) . she is being courted by the scoundrel victor quatermaine ( voice amazingly by ralph fiennes ) . he also loves to shoot rabbits , but this bothers her ladyship and once she meets wallace she becomes more taken with him and his humane ways . wallace comes up with the idea of trying to condition the rabbits to not want to eat the vegetables and things have to be stopped before the process is completed . the rest of the movie is working out all the crazy details of the unexpected results of the partial experiment . lots of fun and quite a visual treat and a stop-action / animation triumph . enjoy
having recently gotten into `` the sopranos , '' after i finished watching the first season ; i rushed to get this . let me just say , i loved the first season ; but i love this more . this is a great season of a great show . not only are the jokes funnier , the acting stronger , the plot twists more surprising , but they also made a couple good decisions . first off , livia soprano ( tony 's mom ) was a big part of the first season ( and frankly , she wore out her welcome several times ) . here , her character is decreased and when she does appear ... it 's not bad . anyway ... tony soprano ( james gandolfini ) and his family , including wife carmela ( edie falco ) , daughter meadow ( jamie-lynn sigler ) , and son a.j . return with a whole array of family and business issues . tony is still seeing dr. melfi ( lorraine bracco ) , his shrink . christopher ( michael imperioli ) tries acting . adreanna 's ( drea de matteo ) uncle richie shows up in the beginning of the season , becoming a main character and ends up dating tony 's sister janice ; despite a personal-and-business feud between them . oh , and there 's a rat in the family . i do n't want to say too much , because i think with any show , it 's better to watch each episode without any real knowledge of what 's going to happen . but , rest assured , if you like the 1st season . you 'll definitely like this one . here 's the list of episodes and a few comments : <NUM> . guy walks into a psychiatrist 's office-the first episode of the 2nd season picks up basically where the first one left off . tony 's uncle junior is in jail , which makes tony new boss , he 's severed ties with his mother , and his psychiatrist wo n't see him . in this episode his sister janice shows up . <NUM> . do not resuscitate-nothing really significant occurs in this episode , but it is pretty entertaining . it 's not the best , but it 's not the worst . <NUM> . toodle f * * king oo-this episode is pretty funny , except my interest in tony 's mother in the hospital goes down everytime there 's a scene that takes place there . <NUM> . commendator-in this episode , tony goes to italy without carmela or the kids for business purposes and pussy 's wife wants to divorce him . the episode is written by series creator , david chase ... so , it 's one of the better episodes even though it 's different from the other ones . <NUM> . big girls do n't cry-this is the most entertaining and cool episode so far and features christopher joining an acting class and letting out some of his inner demons as well as tony returning to therapy . <NUM> . the happy wanderer-this episode has an array of cool things . guest appearances by frank sinatra jr. and robert patrick ; and you hear the song `` down '' by stone temple pilots played in the background in one scene . the season is getting a lot better later on , because this is a really great episode . <NUM> . d girl-this episode is extremely close to perfect . guest appearances by jon favreau , janeane garofalo , and sandra bernhard . <NUM> . full leather jacket-a surprising ( and funny ... kinda ) ending makes this episode one of the best this season . <NUM> . from where to eternity-this episode is written by michael imperioli , who plays christopher , and deals with what happened in the previous episode . very dramatic , very funny , and very entertaining . the classic r & b score works really well . <NUM> . bust out-in this episode , carmela comes close to having an affair with a painter . it 's an entertaining episode . <NUM> . house arrest-this episode is very funny and you also get to see a sensitive side to uncle junior . <NUM> . the knight in white satin armor-this episode was n't my favorite , but the last <NUM> minutes were great . one of the main characters may or may not die in this episode . <NUM> . funhouse-when an episode of a show is written by it 's creator ( especially when it 's the season finale ) it 's usually really good . this is one of the strongest episodes . grade : a
i have been in music industry business for a while now and i would recommand this piece of art to anyone who 's new and seriously wants to become familiar with this industry . whether you 're an artist or manager , this book will help you to understand the basics . i also like the fact that the authors are so honest and give you a real piece of advice if you want to be a successful artist manager , and that is to get education ( especially in business ) . as a recent business graduate it has helped me to be a lot more successful in this industry
first , let me say that i am a very independent , very headstrong , liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband ( masters ' degree ) , owns a business and takes no b.s . from anyone . when this book came out , i truly thought it was a joke . who would write a book like this outside of the 1950s ? ! and where is the `` proper care ... of wives '' ? ! to add 'insult ' , a coworker of my husband ( whose wife stays at home with their <NUM> kids because they feel that this is the role wives are supposed to take on ) , is the one who offered to lend it to me . i thought , `` this will be interesting '' but ca n't criticize until giving it a shot , right ? ? ? ok - there 's the background - here 's the review : i could n't put the book down and read it in a just over a day . while i do n't agree <NUM> % with all that dr. laura says , and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting , this book has changed my life , and as a result it has changed my husband 's life - both for the better . after <NUM> years of marriage , we are clicking like we never have before . i ca n't explain it to you , or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as i confessed to them over margaritas that i not only read the book but i loved the book . all i can say is that the foundation makes sense . it does n't bash working women - dr. laura is one , after all . but it does point out , not so discreetly , that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else . and that the extremism of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women , men and society as a whole . and as i turned each page and as i tried to rebel against some parts ( i should n't burden him with the tales of my day ? ? ! ) , peel away the layers , let down your defenses and let it make sense . ( it is n't that my day is less significant , but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he 'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress . vent to your girlfriends and they 'll dish with you ! focus your time on your husband , family , relationship , etc. , once you get home instead . ) and let me tell ya once you leave the work day at the door , your home becomes your home again , too . so it 's win-win ! really ! ! ! dr. laura 's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters , which is a helpful , practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you do n't feel like you 're getting a lecture ( especially if you are ready to admit you 've been doing a few thngs wrong ! ) . and as you can see the lightbulb go on with average janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to ( aha ! ) getting her message during their conversations , you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly , the underlying simplicity in each of her messages . ok - still skeptical ? then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot . just try to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week ( if you are n't sold on changing your life ) ... what 's the worst that can happen ? if it 's all wrong for you , you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book . ; - ) but just think - what if it works ? ! then you will find a new meaning in your life that you did n't know you were missing . you will have a much happier and rewarding marriage . your husband will adore you . ( sounds rough , huh ? ) trust me - i 'm not about to become a submissive , mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship . but as i made a few minor tweaks in how i treat the man i chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with , i have received rewards from him 10-fold . and to think i thought i was doing it 'right ' all along . ; <NUM> )
lionel is l-o-v-e ! no one writes love songs like mr. richie ! he 's simply gifted ! this collection of songs will have you mellowed out in no time . if you 've had a hard day and want to relax , pop in this cd and it will make you melt and wash all the dirt of the day away ! exceptional collection !
the guns of independence is one of the finest campaign/siege studies this reviewer has read on the revolutionary war . the volume covers the blunders committed by the british commander lord cornwallis and the , for once , amazing cooperation between the allied forces under george washington . of special interest is the attention given the physical operations conducted during the siege of yorktown . the author details the types of artillery used and the construction of entrenchments , redoubts and battery positions . photographs of the reconstructed fortifications help the reader visualize the action . in additon , references to archaeological excavations are not only fascinating , but give the reader a look at the detail involved in siege warfare . the author has done a superb job of research and his writing , though a bit stiff at times , keeps the reader interested . the nuts and bolts of the volume are solid with crisp , clear , well-produced photographs and informative , nicely constructed maps . this volume provides a solid education in the actions at yorktown in september/october <NUM> , and for those interested in the siege , this is the volume to read .
ive listened to ever possible sinatra era from dorsey days to the final reprise days . his voice never seems to falter like most reviewers claim . it would help if i knew when this cd was recorded , but it really doesnt give any information about the dates of the performances . the whole cd proves why sinatra is one of the greatest entertainers of all time . ive heard ever live cd by sinatra and enjoy all of them . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music . anyone who gives this album less then a four , need to listen to the cd again . excellent sinatra concert !
when layne died he did n't get enough respect . he stopped making music for a long time . if he died in <NUM> is death would have been more meaningful like kurt cobains . makes you think ? anyway this album is excellent and the last song is called over now . get it
after the profound impact of the david rawlings produced `` o.c.m.s. , '' to my music collection , my pre-order of `` big iron world '' came with pretty high expectations . i 've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it does n't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of `` wagon wheel , '' `` big iron world '' does pull some wonderfully surprising punches . though he does n't capture ocms 's live act at it 's fullest ( and who really could ) , rawlings ' production once again manages to maintain ocms 's authenticity and pushes their `` old-time '' music into the modern area , without a hint of the tacky , over-produced , artificial , gimmicks , heard on other neo-bluegrass records . `` big iron world '' is not an album stuck in history , or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past . with `` big iron world , '' ocms once again displays its own sound , pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward , while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of woody guthrie , the picking of muleskinner and the late <NUM> 's albums of dylan . moreover , the songs of `` big iron world '' comprise a complete body of work . the pro-union , `` union maid '' and folksy `` james river blues '' are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole , with each song complementing the next . as with all of ocms 's albums , `` big iron world '' is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age . they have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres .
if you love sick ghetto humor this is your show . it 's like an mixture of southpark , family guy , stand up comedys ( like eddy murphys raw etc ) see it and enjoy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
first of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the <NUM> 's with this collection ! ! ! ! each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again ! ! ! ! ! with the beginning of the album which would be `` west end girls '' to `` jealously '' ! ! ! ! ! ! if you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band , but for the great <NUM> songs that take us back in the day ! ! !
having already recorded a full-length christmas album , `` to drive the cold winter away , '' loreena mckennitt went into peter gabriel 's real world studios for three days with some musicians in july <NUM> to record five christmas songs just for fun . the end result is the christmas ep , `` a winter garden . '' just <NUM> minutes long , `` a winter garden '' can easily be taken as a companion disc to `` to drive the cold winter away . '' loreena & company perform this quintet of holiday songs beautifully , especially the gorgeous , nearly-7 minute rendering of `` god rest ye merry gentlemen , '' easily one of the very best versions of this classic song ever recorded . there are also spirited performances of `` coventry carol , '' `` good king wenceslas , '' `` snow '' ( originally featured on `` to drive the cold winter away '' ) , and `` seeds of love . '' `` a winter garden '' is a lovely holiday postcard from loreena mckennitt .
this text provides an interesting overall account of oddities that happened during one of the greatest conflicts of all time . there are some factual data within the book that well-versed readers have identified that could possibly be considered in a later edition . for these individuals , there are countless multi-volume and 500+ page accounts of the history of world war ii . however , to a novice , this work provides short , readable sections about interesting and less known aspects of the second world war . this book makes one reflect on the strange little things that can alter the course of human history . if nothing else , it raises your curiosity to read more works on the topic or the issue or story that you are most interested in . after all , is n't that what reading and exploring information is all about
there is no doubt that i would rate this as one of the best abums of the <NUM> 's and sonic youth 's best abum . however , if you are not a sonic youth fan already , i would steer you to their olater albums first . this album is very atmosphereic . it changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs . it has an almost purposeful low-fi sound ( think of early albums from dinosaur jr. or guided by voices ) . if you are not into experimental , indie rock , go to sonic youth 's later albums like `` goo '' or `` dirty '' . they are more accessible . ( i wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though ) however , if you are a music explorer ; someone who likes bands like radiohead , there is a reason that sonic youth are considered the godfathers ( with apologies to kim gordon , the female bassist ) of underground music . i defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band , and particularly this album .
another nfl season gone , another round of nfl playoffs comin ' up ( as of this writing ) . this is the time i usually look back on those great super bowl teams of yore by whippin ' out those half-hour super bowl highlight shows i taped offa espn2 several years back . that is , until nfl films finally saw the light and put the first thirty together in separate dvd box sets , now combined into this super-set . now i can watch my fave super bowl shows ( aka the 49er and redskins victories , and the ones the cowboys , rams , & raiders lost ) do n't have to worry about my gradually deteriorating vhs tapes getting eaten by my vcr ! while i thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks i threw down , nfl films added even more value to the presentation by throwing two featurettes in with each super bowl game . included among the mini-shows in games i to x are brief profiles of the careers of bart starr , terry bradshaw , bob lilly , jack lambert , and roger staubach . also showcased : the silent enigma that was cowboys rb duane thomas , the dolphins ' undefeated <NUM> season and their famed ( ? ) `` no-name '' defense of the early 70s , the legacy of tom landry , the fights that broke out between cbs and nbc before , during , and after their simultaneous broadcast of game i , the minnesota vikings setting the standard for super bowl futility , and other sideline stuff i never knew about before . then there 's the second decalogue of highlights from `` the great american time-out '' , featuring both good moments ( the 49ers ' first two wins in xvi & xix ; the ` skins ' first super bowl championship in game xvii , and the bears ' <NUM> defense stealing the show in game xx ) and not-so-great ones ( the raiders claiming games xi , xv , and xviii , and the cowboys picking up their second lombardi trophy after xii ) . while i found most of the featurettes in the xi to xx run kinda interesting , i was also driven to nausea by the sappiness of a few of ` em . runnin ' the saccharine-o-meter to the red zone was the piece on anthony munoz and his nfl prospect son , howie long discussing his life in football and how he 's been keepin ' himself busy after his retirement , and jim plunkett pulling himself off of the nfl scrap heap to lead the raiders to two super bowl championships . i swear , if i hear one more interview where someone was talking about how much heart ol ' what's-his-face had , or how so-and-so 's toughness & drive really inspired the rest of the team , i 'm gon na need insulin treatments ! finally , there 's the third decalogue of shows , featuring the good ( the 49ers ' last three championships & the ` skins ' last two ) , the bad ( the giants escaping game xxv with the win , and the cowboys grabbin ' three lombardis in four seasons in games xxvii , xxviii , and xxx ) , and the downright ugly ( the broncos and bills match the vikings ' record for super bowl haplessness ) . sadly , most of the contests recapped here were more like `` stupor bowls '' ( see my listmania on this coma-inducing phenomenon at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/poloadg90jft/ref=cm_aya_av.lm_more/102-8646183-3962510 ) , featuring the bulk of the nfc 's <NUM> year dominance of the big dance , including the only two super bowls where the winning team scored <NUM> points or more ( xxiv and xxvii ) . a couple games were close at halftime ( xxi & xxviii ) , but the nfc champions eventually managed to pull well away from their less-than-capable afc opponents in the second half . fortunately , there was a halfway decent super bowl ( xxx ) along with two of the greatest ever played ( xxiii featuring joe montana 's legendary drive , and buffalo kicker scott norwood 's `` miss heard ` round the world '' in xxv ) to help keep the boredom from setting in too deeply . adding a touch of excitement to both the `` blah '' games and the smattering of close ones is the wonderful background music , which is some of the most exciting soundtrack tunage i 've ever laid my ears on . btw i 'm glad to see nfl films has seen the light and finally put a whole buncha these tracks out on cd ( check it out at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002verqa/ref=cm_aya_wlasin.title/102-8646183-3962510 ? v=glance & coliid=i49vmcs3cobjx & colid=35srbz4zq8hu3 ) ... unfortunately , there were a couple things that i noticed were amiss : the supe xxi and xxiii shows have been edited down a bit . i recall the xxi show being titled `` land of the giants '' during the `` opening credits '' sequence when i caught it on espn2 , but when i saw it on dvd here , the `` land of the giants '' title had been deleted . more heavily edited was the opening title ( `` drive to greatness '' ) & credits sequence to the game xxiii show , which was completely excised . the featurettes in this set usually cover the players who coached or participated in each game ( doug williams as the super bowl 's first black quarterback in xxii , steve young in xxix , etc . ) or breaks down the most memorable moment in that game ( like the niners ' game-winning drive in xxiii , norwood 's miss in xxv , leon lett-ing a td get away in xxvii , etc. ) . like the previous sideshows , the xxi-to-xxx mini-films were a bit sappy ... now i 'm wondering if nfl films will wait until after game xl is played before they put out the final box set -- well , `` final '' ` til games xli to l have been played , anyway -- or will they do it shortly after xxxix , and leave the set one super bowl short of a full ten ? personally , i 'm hoping they go for the former option ; i 'm patient enough that i could stand to wait an extra year to get a complete ten-game set . but even if they do n't wait , set four will likely be the most exciting of the bunch , featuring the best bits of xxxii ( john elway & the broncos finally winning it all ) , xxxiv ( the titans end up a yard short of tying the game as time runs out ) , and xxvi & xxviii ( the pats ' adam vinatieri becomes the first kicker to win two super bowls with field goals in the closing moments ) . in any case , i can hardly freakin ' wait ... ` lat
this is a great book for a very young child , i started reading it to my daughter at <NUM> . it does n't go into detail about a birthmother or the actual adoption process . in fact choco looks for a mom like him and finds love in a family that is very different , but is very happy and loving . my little girl loves this book and enjoys the bright pictures of the various animals . i love that it opens the door to explain that loving families can look different from each other ... and that is ok ! ! ! i would highly reccommend this book to anyone that has a family blessed by adoption from any country .
excellent book ! i have a nice collection of pop up books as well as books about their construction . this book is outstanding . the drawings are clear in their explanations and descriptions -- much more so than photographs would be . you can see the fronts , backs , sides , edges -- whatever is pertinent to understanding the form being illustrated . one especially nice feature is the author 's explanation of things to watch out for -- potential stumbling blocks to creating a functioning mechanism . he begins with the basics and then demonstrates elaborations . i think his illustrating applications of the forms is inspiring and informative -- he goes beyond showing how to make , for example , a pop-up box and uses examples that show what a pop-up box might be . i consider this book a `` must have '' for those interested in the subject
this is an excellent short review of european quest for a language to unite its disparate nations with each other and the rest of the world . i thought that the book did an excellent job of staying on the subject and illustrating the progression of thought in this area . it does confine itself to europe and time period as defined in the beginning of the book . that is excellent , there is simply no other way to cover as much ground as the book attempts to do , and i feel that it does suceed admirably . as usual , eco 's erudition and research are amazing . this book is published in the context of a european series of books about europe and i wish there was a similar book series that would cover this ground for far east and india as well . i am sure people there worked on the same kind of problems . some of the problems with languages and methods described seem so obvious that one has to wonder what the authors themselves thought about them . of course , this is a whole other book series . i wish there was a <NUM> 1/2 rating as i do not think this is truly a masterpiece , but certainly a very very good book from a very very good author of fiction and non-fiction . a bonus for fans of focault 's pendulum -- a lot of data in that fiction book refers to work discussed in this non-fiction work . great fun
it took me only two weeks to watch all <NUM> episodes of `` murder , she wrote '' - the complete third season . and my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two : just more mystery fun with angela lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver jessica fletcher . familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three , including recent `` syriana '' oscar winner george clooney , past oscar winners ernest borgnine ( `` the poseidon adventure '' ) and martin balsam ( `` psycho '' ) , `` friends '' alum courtney cox arquette , `` brady bunch '' veterans florence henderson and barry williams , veteran comic buddy hackett , and `` naked gun '' star leslie nielsen . other guest stars include : gloria stuart ( `` titanic '' ) , g.w . bailey ( `` police academy '' ) , tess harper ( `` tender mercies '' ) , jessica walter ( `` arrested development '' ) , hayley mills ( `` the parent trap '' ) , bill macy ( `` maude '' ) , genie francis ( `` general hospital '' ) , dinah manoff ( `` empty nest '' ) , and harry morgan ( `` m * a * s * h '' ) . three stars from the `` star trek '' tv shows turned up for guest appearences : george takei ( the original `` star trek '' series ) , levar burton ( `` star trek : the next generation '' ) , and kate mulgrew ( `` star trek : voyager '' ) . erin moran , best known for playing joannie on the popular '70s sitcom `` happy days '' , guest starred in the third episode of season three titled `` unfinished business '' , which reunited her with `` happy days '' co-star tom bosley , who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of `` murder , she wrote '' as amos tupper , the sheriff of jessica fletcher 's hometown of cabot cove , maine ( i 've very much enjoyed bosley 's appearences on `` murder , she wrote '' as well as william windom 's reoccuring appearences as cabot cove doctor seth hazlitt ) . and in an interesting scenario , tom selleck and john hillerman turn up in their `` magnum p.i . '' roles as part of a cross-over episode , with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of `` magnum p.i . '' ( which was in its seventh season ) and concluding with an episode of `` murder , she wrote '' ( episode # <NUM> to be exact ) . that episode of `` magnum p.i . '' is featured as a bonus on season three of `` murder , she wrote '' . the `` magnum p.i . `` / '' murder , she wrote '' cross-over episodes ( titled `` novel connection '' and `` magnum on ice '' ) were a favorite of mine . other great episodes from season three include : `` death stalks the big top '' parts <NUM> and <NUM> , `` unfinished business '' , `` obituary for a dead anchor '' , `` the corpse flew first class '' , `` crossed up '' , `` simon says , color me dead '' , `` no laughing murder '' , `` no accounting for murder '' , and `` murder , she spoke '' . `` murder , she wrote '' season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime , and lansbury is wonderful as usual . i 'm sure the fun will continue with season four !
terriffic movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt

this movie came out the same year that the supreme court gave us abortion on demand via roe v. wade . how ironic is that ? we are living in these days to a certain degree already . this film is disturbing on many levels because of it 's impending reality . i highly recommend it as a wake up call .
i rarely watch american tv anymore because of the chance to see crime drama at it 's best like the `` touching evil '' series . i have epals that i share my favs with and visa-versa . the `` touching evil '' series was recommended by an epal because of it 's intelligent drama . i rented it , for the lowest price , of course , just in case it was n't worth the cash . i really liked it . i do have my favorite episodes , though . the first episode , `` the lost boys '' of the series and the first episode in series <NUM> . series <NUM> and <NUM> do not have specific episode titles , so i call this one , `` hearts '' . `` the lost boys '' introduces detective inspector dave creegan ( robson green ) to us . creegan is volitile , yet brilliant . he had been wounded in the line of duty , which was followed by psychiatric counselling . it makes one wonder why acc enwright ( michael feast ) called him back into service . creegan 's emotional volitility caused the breakup of his marriage . after getting to know creegan as a character , the audience can see why . creegan is a `` driven '' man and has instincts that can see through the mask of a criminal as he does in `` the lost boys '' . creegan sees through the mask of university professor ronald hinks ( ian mcdiarmid-sen. palatine from star wars ) . creegan fights with enwright and other team members to get hinks arrested for kidnapping <NUM> boys , but hink 's lawyers have a larger case for creegan 's harrassment of hinks . creegan is teamed up with di susan taylor ( nicola walker ) , detective sargent jonathan kreitman ( adam kotz ) and detective constable mark rivers ( shaun dingwall ) . there is conflict almost immediately between the team members . i would like to see a 4th `` touching evil '' series , if only to clean up some questions before ending this intelligent series . my biggest question , of course , is `` why did enwright bring creegan back in the first place ? '' creegan made it clear that he was a `` one-to-one '' person and that selling ice cream would probably be the best job he would enjoy and he was psychologically unstable . there is also the question of why taylor was picked to partner with creegan . `` hearts '' is just plain brilliant . all the actors are at their best in this one , but robson green stands out . after the murder of a friend , he finally crosses that psychological line . green is brilliant followed by andy serkis ( dr. michael lawler ) . the other actors follow closely behind . do i recommend this series . yes , but only the british one . when we americans try to recreate a wonderful program like this , we always fall short
an benthusiast of both philip glass & amp ; ravi , i find this cd even more delightful than i had expected before the purchase . listening to glass 's simple uplifting melodies accompanied by tabla is exhilerating . listening to ravi shankar 's sitars with a cello line composed by glass is awesome . i recommend this cd to anyone interested in either composer or style of music . it pleases both aesthetics
i remember seeing this short film as a young child and it scared me so much that now as an adult lover of horror films seeked to purchase it for my family . i am not one who scares easily and this film was frightening . i loved watching it with my husband , because it was so much fun to see him jump during the movie ! i totally recommend renting/purchasing this from the black sabboth trilogy collection . happy haunting ! pam from eagle mountain lake , texa
this books deals great with strangers . it also shows not to judge a person by the outside . the only thing it needs is to tell kids what to do if a stranger does capture them .
.. it may seem simple .. cheap cgi graphics and bad acting and uknown actors .. but still the action in the movie is really good , from africa to roterdamn or however u spell it .. one notetable scene was the last scene , where jackie chan takes on <NUM> guys at the same time on top of a skyscraper .. he kicks both their asses .. after that he decides to jump off a steep part of the building ... instead of using the elevator , ,only jc can pull something off like that .. i think this is prolly jc 's last great film .. in hk .. i dint really like his u.s. features .. the action in those was weak .. and the fighting was jus .. really amtatuer , iguess he had to slow down in the american films .. anyhow if u lookn for a good jc movie .. go out and buy this one .. it can rank with supercop .. police story <NUM> and <NUM> .. and project a .. real good movie ... <NUM> thumbs u
fabulous-this is a must have for any bee gee fans . my <NUM> year old daughter even likes this music
steve oedekerk ( the writer of the film bruce almighty ) directed , wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof . though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking , kung pow is genuinely remarkable , in that much of it is composed of scenes from a <NUM> chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them . watch the credits at the end for examples of what i 'm talking about . because of this creative juxtaposition , kung pow manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own . it really does `` feel '' like a vintage martial arts film , yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd , it just wrings laughs out of you . sidelight : the entire movie is dubbed , and oedekerk also did all the voices for every character ( except whoa . ) to further the bad dubbing effect , oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera
this season was pretty good with a lot of actions and a great number of issues resolved . hopefully the fifth season will answer the rest

let me start by saying that i love this movie and love fulci.this was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated , it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it . ( let me explain . ) this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me.when i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from 'city ' i was shocked.when i watched the nipple scene in 'ripper ' i was shocked.watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest ( im sorry ) .the only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned , which honestly i enjoyed more.zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest . ( isnt that why we watch fulci flicks ?
written in <NUM> , this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime brits in a poor backwater in west africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality . foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both henry scobie , the honest policeman of this coastal town , and his `` literary '' wife , louise , who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local british `` club '' members who constantly mind one another 's business . scobie no longer loves his wife but ca n't bring himself to hurting her . he simply pities her . and louise no longer loves henry and wants desperately to escape from west africa , especially when she finds out that her `` ticki '' has been passed up for promotion to commissioner . the atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man , wilson , appears on the scene and , in his youthful stupidity , falls in love with louise while he conducts secret investigations on british authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through africa to germany . scobie is one of those suspects . a marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt syrian merchant , yusef , is thrown into the mix . i can see sidney greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation . add jealousy , desperation , a contrast of honesty and lies , sex , and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains . o yes , and then , as always , there 's the brilliant writing of graham greene , his wonderful metaphors , crystal clear descriptions , and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters . all this equals a modern classic . my only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding catholicism , a religion i can not stomach anymore , and my personal disbelief that someone like scobie can take catholicism so seriously . but this is my own thing . greene remains brilliant , original , and indeed , `` the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man 's consciousness and anxiety , '' or at least one of the top five
bloodline by fiona mountain is the second book in the natasha blake genealogist mystery series . after an elderly man hires natasha to investigate the family background of his granddaughter 's fiance , he is mysteriously murdered . the man 's son hires natasha to find out why . mountain does a much better job this time of connecting with the reader . natasha 's connections to her friends and family deepen and develop as well . there are loads of subplots , including natasha 's insomnia which occasionally makes her take actions that had me shaking my head in disbelief . the story takes an unexpected dark turn as natasha finds out that sometimes finding the answers to questions only creates more questions with answers no one wants to hear . this was a fun read that made me think a bit too . i look forward to the next in the series .
in reading heart sense by dr. paula reeves , i have found this book to be a vast and deep sounce of the most practical and applicable knowledge and wisdom for changing your life from a fate-oriented , sad and unfulfilled life to one of living consciously into your own personal destiny .dr . reeves has given us a truly brilliant blueprint intergrating the current scientific and medical research with the intuitive wisdom of the body mind heart . for me , this is the jewel in an immense array of & quot ; self-help & quot ; books out there . it is so much more that it falls beyond that catagory . thank you , dr. reeves , for this profound work
generated in these reviews tells me there 's something important in this album . here 's what i think ... sometimes you hear a tune and you say , `` wow , what a great copy of the beatles . '' a clear example of this is the knickerbockers ' sixties tune `` lies . '' a great tune , upbeat pop all the way , with no pretensions to anything but turning a buck with a beat . god bless ya , my boys . to my knowledge , the knickerbockers are memorialized in the room at the rock and roll hall of fame devoted to one hit wonders . but the song is still a great copy of the sound that made the beatles the dominant force in a half century of pop music . anyone who wants to debate this point can meet me at the side of the podium after the lecture . but this album , `` bellybutton '' by jellyfish , is a subtle , loving , and cleverly complete tribute to the beatles . in its <NUM> songs , jellyfish captures virtually every era and accomplishment of the beatles , from thier earliest days of raw enthusiasm/talent/new harmonies , through the psychedelic growth years , to the era when the inexorable forces of the beatles ' unprecedented fame were driving them apart even while they made thier most innovative and insightful music . even this album 's artwork is a subtle evocation of the now-classic sergeant pepper cover . jellyfish members have clearly studied music of virtually all genres ( ok , i do n't think i hear any c & w in this recording ) , and the mix of influences in truly entertaining . the songs are each little magic showcases for the impressive talents of this now-gone band . every one tells a story based on conditions and emotions -- heartbreak , shame , addiction , loss , longing . the musicianship is outstanding . arrangements pay tribute to the kind of work that made george martin a vital element of the beatles ' success . i like the album a lot , even though it is more than <NUM> years old . i keep returning to its spot on my ipod . it never fails to snap me out of a bad mood and run me through a gamut of emotions in a short <NUM> minutes . it 's a great example of why music is so important to so many people
i finally got around to watching this movie . i had heard that this was a black comedy of the quality of `` saun of the dead '' . i wouldnt go that far , but i do give this movie top marks . ever since i saw `` serenity '' at the movies , and then started watching the tv series `` firefly '' i have been a big fan of nathan fillion . he is brilliant in this movie too . the premise is nothing better than the usual 80s horror flick , but that is part of its charm . the effects are gross , the `` heros '' are scared , the monsters are slimy . what more could you ask for ? well the answer to that is you want to be entertained . `` slither '' is a movie which does entertain
this my recommendation for people who want to learn stochastic calculus for the first time . the virtue of this book is that it keeps matters simple , well grounded , and intuitive enough to hook the newcomers in the subject . once you get comfortable enough and want to learn technical detail necessary for scholarly research , there are other excellent expositions such as karatzas and shreve ( <NUM> ) and protter ( <NUM> ) . some reviews complained that this book is limited to stochastic integration with respect to brownian motion , but that is precisely why i recommend this book . by starting with browning motion readers can form concrete mental image of stochastic integration and get ready to stride to more general setting if necessary . another virtue of this book is the plenty ( easy ) exercise problems . working through them is perhaps the best way to learn stochastic calculus .
great exercises . well worth the money if you intend on using it . i never work out while watching the dvd but certainly integrate the exercises on this program into my routine with positive results
da chen 's rendition of memories etched within his heart is very descriptive . i especially like this passage : `` ... the thoughts tortured me and i squirmed in shame and humiliation , but i had to face reality . the teacher could throw me out with a sneer on his face . that was fine , i had thick skin . a poor child could n't afford to have thin skin . only rich boys and well-to-do girls with cute little butterflies in their hair could afford to have thin skin '' for a child of nine , to have such vivid memory of a childhood , is startling . the innocence and words crafted makes colors of the mountain , a reading worth investing time in . reading between the words give you an insight to how deep da chen 's spiritual values are . an amazing , funny and innocent book
now , this movie may not have been known well when it came out in <NUM> , but , it 's popularity grew as much as it has been shown on tv ( countless times ) . now , let 's say that john hughes produced this film ; i bet you that it would have been much better known if it had his name on it ; thus , at the time that this movie came out , john hughes had some big hits under his belt ( i.e . sixteen candles , & the breakfast club to name a couple ) . if it had molly ringwald as the lead actress , then it would have been a bigger hit . joyce hyser , however , wasn't/ is n't a very well known ( if known ) actress . so , alot of people really did n't pay much attention to this movie . i mean , what really big hit movies or starring roles did ms. hyser have really ? this and a few others were her only starring roles . from what i 've seen of her movies besides this one and another , she mostly had small parts . like , does anyone remember seeing ms. hyser in the <NUM> 's classic `` valley girl '' ( starring nicholas cage ) ? the only scene she was in was at the prom at the end asking `` where are the cups ? `` , and , that was it . true , this movie may not be `` fantastic '' , but , it was alot better then some of those cheesy <NUM> 's movies that came out around the same time . i personally think this movie was well-acted , and , cute for it 's time . it 's honestly underrated , but , by it showing on hbo , and , comedy central alot it 's popularity grew . hence , why they finally released it on dvd . it may not be a known `` classic '' , like , `` pretty in pink '' , `` sixteen candles '' , `` the breakfast club '' , and `` st. elmoes fire '' , but , it 's a classic in it 's own right . i think if better known at the time , people would n't of slepted on this classic . joyce hyser was wonderful in this role . and , i think it 's honestly her best , and , i am glad it 's finally being appreciated after <NUM> years ! i am soo glad they talked about it on vh1 's `` i love the <NUM> 's 3-d '' last year .
there are often times where we see artists sampling great songs from others , and that has been considered a good or a bad move . recently , the red hot chili peppers sampled tom petty & the heartbreakers mary jane 's last dance for their funky track , dani california . nevertheless , to spin a song of your own , and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic . that is the case for prince , and his latest single , fury , the third single from his album <NUM> . the song samples the opening hook from his <NUM> 's track <NUM> , and takes it into something else . the song actually is good , and delivers a unique feeling of funk , soul & pop . it is a really good track , that still shows that prince has n't lost his edge . i found this to be surprisingly upbeat and worth its price . this is a great song , and i hope it gets a lot of good airplay . song :
like the recent revival of the ford thunderbird , the enterprise season <NUM> dvd set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful . the video quality is fine , sound is rich , and the extras are good , but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series , like freaks and geeks , without the high price . ( through a series of fortunate events , i got my copy at a discount . ) i do n't consider myself a big star trek fan . most of the shows set in the trek universe work so hard to be `` star trek '' that much of the life is gone from them . my immediate attraction to enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows -- for example , `` comic relief '' is blissfully absent here . the goofy humor of star trek : the next generation never appealed to me . fox mulder 's dry wise cracking on the x files ? funny stuff ! commander data trying to be sherlock holmes ? not so much . season <NUM> of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories . ( wow , there are aliens trying to destroy the enterprise with a time bomb ! oh , it was only a dream . ) threatened with tv extinction , brannon braga and rick berman ( who wrote many of season <NUM> 's episodes themselves ) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging trek formula . all kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored , characters gained dimension , and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in enterprise 's 22nd . in season <NUM> we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera ( wowie zowie phasers , stunts , and great production design ) and the ideas of real speculative fiction ( cloning , dimensional shifts , and temporal manipulation ) . ruminations on loneliness , loss , and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama . ( curiously , religion is absent . ) at the same time , archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of er so compelling . few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as `` star trek : enterprise -- the complete third season .
terminal heaven 's rock is a great song ! sick vibration and over amp are pretty good too . over amp has usual weird english lyrics . `` she lives by fake slide away '' . i highly recomend you get this . it 's <NUM> minutes , <NUM> seconds a pure good songs . you will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your cd player
if you 've listened to enough trance mixes you may already be familiar with bt . for example : bt 's godspeed and dreaming are featured in some of dj micro 's mixes ( dj mixed & micro-tech mix 2.0 ) . if you can recall , these tracks have been more than entrancing . this cd contains the whole package including those two amazing tracks and the other featured tracks in this mix is incredible ! it is difficult to make a decision off the bat whether or not to get this cd since amazon does n't have a preview feature . but trust me , i took the plunge based on the reviews alone and i could n't have been more pleased . here is a breakdown of some tracks on the cd : <NUM> . ) movement in still life - this track is the intro to the cd and starts off with a skit phone call , with some guy ( who sounds like some beat junky ) talking , saying he wants to make some fresh hits . it 's funny because he says to call him back @ his mom 's house and if he 's at his grandmas , call his pager . as cheezy as this sounds track <NUM> quickly transitions into some hard hitting beats with a nice urban b-boy feel to it . 10/10 <NUM> . ) dreaming - this is a nice track . it starts out a little slow and gradually brings you back up to speed . this track features vocals by kristy hawkshaw whos voice is very soothing . some insight to some of the lyrics included in the chorus are : `` no words no talk , we 'll go dreaming ; no pain no hurt , we 'll go dreaming . '' near the end of track the vocals reverb and fade into some motivating beats . 9/10 <NUM> . ) giving up the ghost - this track follows the previous track almost by suit and carries the same trance beat with some new sounds and synthesizers . since this cd is a continous mix , i believe this track was included to support the next selection . whether or not that 's fact , the transition between these two tracks ( <NUM> & <NUM> ) are very tasteful . 8/10 <NUM> . ) godspeed - here is where you want to turn up the volume , adjust your highs and lows , turn the bass down a few notches so the deep base on this track does n't drown out the inspirational feel . as this track spins above the lasers of your cd player , the ground beneath you feet seems to vanish and leave you in suspense . the enticing female vocal quivers elate your senses and unexpected booms and repercussions of the base send you freefalling , landing within the tides of machine beats sending you to a far away corner of your brain so you can trance out . i give this one an amazing 10/10 . <NUM> . ) running down the way up - this is one of my favorite selections . this track starts out with an acoustic guitar interlude for about 20-30 seconds , then some attractive female vocals come to the forefront . the vocals really set the scene and are heard throughout the the entire track . what makes these vocals all the more appealing , the begining vocals are whiped with exotic reverbs and channel mixing which make this track what some refer to as `` ear candy '' . then the excitement ends with impressive electric guitar rifts and licks . i classify this one a 10/10
saw burnt offerings first as a kid on tv , just realized this was the title of it after seeing the picture on the back of the box of the old woman in a chair sitting by the window , a very classic horror image i did n't forget . the story builds slowly , as the small family of mother , father , son and aunt begin to experience strange occurences in the giant mansion . there 's one room with an old lady in it that we do n't get to see till the end , which really builds up some fear in a effective way , rather than quick , cheap scares like so many films rely on these days . the ending is truly classic . this one 's worth watching for haunted mansion fans . there 's very little you see , but very much that is suggested . has some similarities to the shining
the best thing about case histories is that it is not a murder mystery . kate atkinson 's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe , unsolved crimes , supernumerary suspects , and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters . i was pleased by the lifelike , sympathetic presentation of the two male characters . unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page . the plot of case histories consists of three unrelated cold cases . all the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution . but this resolution fails to materialize . the detective solves one murder , the perpetrator casually confesses to a second , and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback . and the cats live happily ever after
if you do n't like this , perhaps you are a bibliophobe ? or `` reality-shy '' ... ( or a jingoist ; i 'm not describing a certain group of people , am i ? ) watch it already . my stupid unnecessary criticisms : since they could n't acheive realistic skinniness , they should of had an amazon traipse through ; the planes should have been models for the `` handmade '' effect . recommended : on superstition by plutarch the fall of japan by william craig movies : tigerland the bunker ( horror film ) merry christmas mr. lawrence the films of peter watkins documentary : horror in the east `` you 'd make a terrible prostitute ...
there is no doubt in my mind that this is the finest recording of handel 's messiah available . as said before by other reviewers , the voices are very clean , unlike some renditions that sound like they are performing a wagnerian opera . these are definitely some of the most beautiful voices i have ever heard ( bravo especially to the tenor ) . diction is excellent . the sound quality is very good , and it is on period instruments . this is one of my favorite sets . very highly recommended . however , i had some trouble obtaining a copy of this recording , and there is a possibility that it has gone out of print , so hurry
i grew up watching this and just love watching the show now as an adult ! i really love that these came out on dvd and wonder when season <NUM> is coming out ? hurry ! : ) it 's nice to have a show that 's clean , interesting , has intelligent characters , and entertaining at the same time ! woo hoo
it 's not a player book ; i was looking at christian based books on dating & relationships and this book kept coming up . it explains women psychology in dating
this is a fabulous & quot ; feel good & quot ; movie . i 've watched it a dozen times and it 's still a favorite to pop in the vcr when company comes calling . this movie never got the publicity it deserved so it 's pretty much a surprise when i play it for guests . then , everyone wants a copy . i probably would never have heard of it myself if my mom had n't been an extra in it . it was filmed in winchester bay , oregon where my mom had a gift shop
director : denzel washington cast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : <NUM> minutes rated pg-13 for violence , language and mature thematic material involving child abuse . based on a true story , and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book , `` antwone fisher '' is at heart a study of psychological disturbance , laced with reasonable amounts of hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit . it 's a peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly in some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused denzel washington 's directorial talents ( which are generally good ) with the various workings of his film 's plot , which can be argued about . antwone fisher 's story starts in the navy , where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate , and is hauled up before the captain . sent to navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins to work out issues of anger that , it turns out , stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend . at the same time fisher ( played exceptionally well by newcomer derek luke ) , struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . in a parallel plot thread , washington 's character , the ever-reasonable dr. davenport , is having marital problems . in due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and fisher is a catalyst for his own change . fisher 's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route : after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience , he was hired by a sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over <NUM> drafts before it was acceptable . most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft , although washington 's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . the most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character . these include the psychiatrist 's ironic domestic problems , as well as fisher 's tentative love life . one is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening the appeal of a central , harrowing , personal history . the fisher - cheryl romance for instance , while in context necessarily clumsy , is also ultimately gauche . and once consummated , it is left to languish without further comment , as if further exploration of this side to fisher 's maturing was unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher 's script introduces another element into the young african-american 's tortured life as a foster child . during flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation ' justifications from mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting . significantly , such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself , and soon disappear from view . on the plus side is the central performance by derek luke as the hero , a perfectly judged acting job , that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - `` i do n't know what to do '' - with lack of self-pity . washington 's role is also well done . given the difficulty of the actor-director role , he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss , either in front or behind the camera . this is washington 's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing , it 's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods . arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role . despite its flaws , `` antwone fisher '' is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged , enigmatic individual ; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children did n't have to endure such horrors .

scott poulson-bryant is a bright young artist with heady credentials and a true gift for creative thinking and well-crafted writing skills . he joins the growing ranks of young african american strong writers such as e.l. ayala , e. lynn harris , keith boykin , j.l . king , caesar brunswick , christopher david , and stanley bennett clay who not only address issues heretofore considered taboo in the black community , but succeed not only as brave new voices but also as gifted , important writers . hung : a meditation on the measure of black men in america starts out with a terrific cover , promises revelation of secrets everyone wants to know , addresses his reader with pertinent facts , and then progresses to relax and offer a rather personalized memoir of his experiences as a black man in america , a man who knows the myths and the realities about phallic secrets , and shares his own insights as well as those of gentlemanly unnamed confidents from whom he gathers his facts . along the way poulson-bryant not only discusses phallus size , but he also explores the mystique of black men who model for books ( mapplethorpe is a frequent reference point ) , the porn industry , the world of athletes ( yes , naming names ) , the rap world , and the executive world . but he does n't limit his meditation to experiences interviewing men : poulson-bryant wisely includes women in his foray of questioning the importance of size as a feature of desirability vs. myth vs. disadvantage . it is a well-rounded book and one that never lets the interest lag . but what one comes away with from this book is an appreciation of the exceptional style of writing of scott poulson-bryant . he is a writer of charm , of humor , of wit , and of intelligence . this reader would like to see how he performs in the field of fiction : in reportage he is up there with the best ! grady harp , october <NUM>
snoop dogg is one of my favorite rappers . i 've grown up listening to him since i was a child while he was rhyming on dr. dre 's `` the chronic '' . i 've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums ( `` the game is sold ... '' ) and when he dropped a decent album ( `` paid the cost ... '' ) . `` the blue carpet treatment '' would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me . this album is full of laced beats and good rhymes . `` think about it '' comes off real strong from snoop laced with a dope beat . the radio hit `` thats that ... '' with r. kelly gives listeners a nice r & b tune to listen to . as well as the other hit `` i wan na love you '' with akon , another hit for this album . as i said in my title , this is what `` cali iz active '' should have sounded like . that cd was so horrible and failed to follow it 's concept . this album followed what that concept should have been . most of the guest appearances are form cali . `` candy '' would feature goldie loc , mc eiht , e-40 , and the dogg pound , and a real nice tune to ride to . `` lax '' with ice cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from biggie 's `` going back to cali '' in the hook . i 'd say for some reason , my favorite song is toward the end with `` imagine '' with dr. dre . and d'angelo . possibly because that piano laced throughout the song . snoop would close the album with `` conversations '' with stevie wonder , showing off that he 's trying to get his mind right . other guests include the game , b-real from cypress hill , george clinton , and kam ( where the hell have you been kam ? ? ? ) . although this is a good cd i 've heard from snoop in a minute , it still has some rough parts . `` <NUM> lil ' crips '' sounded kinda weak to me . and i was n't feeling the song `` beatin ' up on yo pads '' although it 's a positive song about him coaching and playing football , but it 's a good song , so i 'll make it my honorable mention track . if you heard that this album was his most consistant since `` doggystyle '' , you heard correct . we 're more than aware that he 's not going to drop another one of those albums , but this is a real good one from snoop . if other west coast artists drop albums like this , we might have the west coast making a comeback . and being a fan of west coast rap music , i am more than ready for it . if you thought snoop fell off , well he gives doubters `` tha blue carpet treatment '' . lyrics : a- production : a- guest appearances : a- musical vibes : b overall : a- my favorite tracks from this album : think about it , thats that ... , candy ( drippin ' like water ) , gangbangn <NUM> , lax , which one of you , i wan na [ love ] you , psst ! , imagine , converstions honorable mention track : beatin ' on yo pads peace everyone ! !
for me , crossword puzzles have been a casual thing , i might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife , who is a much more avid fan , might have left a partially finished one about , which i will pick up and see if i can find some answers . those who appear in this movie find crossword puzzles to be anything but casual . and this is not about just any crossword puzzle . this is the `` gold standard . '' the nyt crossword puzzle . you may genuflect if you wish . as the movie unfolds we hear how the nyt graduates the difficulty of its puzzles from monday to sunday . we learn how they are constructed , how they are made more difficult , what the rules of puzzle building are and how crossword puzzles infect and afflict those who are addicted to them . celebrities from ken burns to jon stweart are utilized in cameo pieces , some of which are very entertaining . this all culminates in the marriott hotel in stamford , ct where the world crossword puzzle championship takes place every year in march . we meet some of the contestants , we are shown how the tournament is organized and the friendships it has engendered during the years it has been held and as the days pass we get to the `` a '' finals where three finalists try to solve a puzzle against time on large easels set up at the front of the room which will really draws you in to the genre . whether crossword puzzles are your thing or not , this is an entertaining and interesting movie to see . it did not encourage me to increase my crossword puzzle activity , but it sure gave me a deeper appreciation of what those who are hooked on it go through . there is something in this movie for everyone .
i loved it because it really did show sagan the way he really was . he did a lot of really wonderful things and i will always miss him
in spite of minor issues related to censorship of nudity , which do not affect the plot , the cinematographic version of the play is excellent . both the acting and the recreation of the atmosphere of the spanish barroque are major achievements of this film .
very rarely does jazz give me that wonderful feeling only music can give . i have the best of duke ellington , and a little known group headed by jazz/rock drummer bill bruford called earthwork 's ; they 're o.k . but this album by monk makes me wan na sing , and there are n't even any vocals in it . i think monk is among my favorite tunesmith 's , up there with mozart and prokofiev . that is because no matter how many times you listen to their works you never lose the stimulation or interest for a second
wow ! after reading the reviews on amazon for this cd , i can tell that above anything else , natalie cole stirs a lot of emotion in her audience . it 's a rare quality that inspires others to speak out the way everyone has on this controversial cd ! from that hot wailing vocal in the opening song `` criminal '' to the searing gospel version of `` if i ever lose my faith in you '' , this collection is a winner ! ! ! natalie has tackled various genres and made them her definitive version of each song . she is funky in `` old man '' , soulful in `` day dreaming '' , and haunting in `` the man with the child in his eyes '' . i ca n't help but feel that these song writers would not only give her a nod , but the grammy award as well ! you can count me in when natalie comes to town in concert . i ca n't wait to see her perform these songs and more ! thank you natalie ! i ca n't say that you 're `` back '' , because you simply never went away
this is a really enjoyable film . the action is great , the comic timing perfect , the stunts amazing . i 'm stumped by how hollywood can decide to release twin dragons when there are such great jackie classics as project a <NUM> and <NUM> , drunken master <NUM> and <NUM> , police story <NUM> and <NUM>
make it big is one of the two wham ! albums with the other being music from the edge of heaven . of all the three albums released by wham ! , make it big is the better one of the three . with three number one hits including `` careless whisper '' , wake me up before you go-go '' and `` everything she wants '' . another song that made the top <NUM> is `` freedom '' ranking at # <NUM> . all of the songs on the album r my favorites so i do n't have a clear cut favorite . everyone else haz said wut i wanted to say so there 's no use in repeating it except thta i highly emphasize that if u r an 80s music lover or love to listen to pop in particular , then u must get this album
i went into watching this film a little aprehensive . i love horror movies but <NUM> % are usually never scary in the least bit . ( usually they are just very fun to watch ) this movie was creepy as hell and has a high amount of tension that continues to build . it actually freaked me out which is very hard to do . this film and malevolance are the only <NUM> horror films to give me that gut feeling of fright that i crave from this genere of movies in about the past year or so . my dog even started growling at the tv and barking being the savage gaurd dog that he is . if you love horror films than this one is a must see , the story is very similar to and is basicly a mix of wrong turn and the texas chainsaw massacre , and they pull it off very wel
what to say about this book ... it shows you wooden boat construction at its very , very best . starting with raw lumber and simple hand tools , larry pardey takes us , step by laborious step , on the odyssey of building a truly world class cruising yacht , his <NUM> ' taleisin . not only is every step of the hull construction detailed , but we also get `` real world '' time and cost estimates so there are no illusions as to how much time and money each step will take . there are superb `` pro and con '' treatments of aspects that have a variety of solutions . if there are multiple ways to tackle a job , he makes two columns and discusses the pros and cons of each in detail . usually you just get the author 's opinions without any extra information . this book is famous also because of it 's very important final appendix on epoxies in salt water craft , and how epoxy often is weakened to the point of failure by salt water , repeated stress , and heat - <NUM> things that a sailboat gets plenty of . i am told by many epoxy fans that this chapter `` is now out of date '' , but i do n't remember any amazing new epoxies coming out that make pardey 's findings defunct . george buehler says it best - epoxy works best when it 's backed up by a bolt . `` praise epoxy but pass the nails '' . also note the title `` the hull '' . that 's all you get . when it comes to decks , houses , rigging , etc. , you 're on your own . hopefully pardey will bring out volume <NUM> on the rest of the boat . he 's a masterful carpenter and his work is glorious and gleaming , fully among the best of yacht-quality work ever done . this is something you need to seriously soak in . this is the best , and not necessarily realistic for the average home boat builder . this book represents a set of skills that you probably do n't have , and may find difficulty developing in your lifetime , unless you are really dedicated . also , there is the time factor . it 's one thing to look at a photo of fastening planking on the frame and say `` i understand that ... i can do that ! '' and it 's quite another to realize how many hundreds of hours are involved in just a few of the aspects of the hull construction . pardey could work on his yacht full time - he did n't need to do other work to pay the bills . he was also in the prime of his health . most americans only have this kind of time if they 're retired , and that often means not as strong as we once were . if we 're young and strong it means we have to work for a living . so , this particular boat might be best aimed at the youngish man who does n't have to work very much for his living . either that or you 'll spend about a decade of weekends on this boat . if you want to get on the water a little quicker than that , consider george buehler 's `` backyard boat building '' , for salty and sea worthy crusising yachts that the average man or woman can build themselves in a year or two , and actually take to the caribbean , or further . i 'm not saying do n't aspire to pardey 's level , but remember that you live in the real world . it 's better to build a simple boat than to not build a fancy one . it 's better to go sailing than it is to spend your free weekends for <NUM> years screwing down teak decking . but , that consideration aside , there is no better guide to traditional yacht construction than this
what more can be said ? this album blows so many great albums in rock history away . i became a fan of dishwalla when i was <NUM> . i bought their first cd like a week before counting blue cars started getting airplay everywhere . but ever since i got this amazing cd i have just not enjoyed pet your friends nearly as much as i used to . that 's not trashing pet your friends . this album 's just that amazing .
i love this re-telling of the classic dr. suess cartoon that everybody over <NUM> grew up with ! jim carey was born to play this role and ron howard 's direction is superb , as well as all the supporting cast ! great story-telling that will last for generations to come
kipling has undeservedly been relegated to obscurity . he is the foundation of the modern-day action movie . his tight prose bespeaks his journalist background in a time when fewer and fewer writers can hone their craft in these jobs . this selection of his most famous and best work is a wonderful addition to anyone 's library , especially if you 're a tolkien fan or interested in the victorian period
sheldon stern has presented a harrowing study of one of the most dangerous events in world history - the cuban missile crisis . in his book , the week the world stood still : inside the secret cuban missile crisis , we are presented with an event whose story line reads like it was written by a robert ludlum-like mystery writer , this story , however , was frighteningly true history . with the careful , thoughtful , and thorough research that is mr. stern 's trademark , the reader is presented with the complete inside story of that fateful week . this is a must read for , not only students , but adults as well . kudos
volume iv of `` in search of lost time '' begins in the afternoon of the day of princess of guermantes 's party , the one that marcel had looked forward for so long as his definitive entrance into the world of high society . that afternoon , by spying on them , marcel discovers with his own eyes , for the first time , homosexuality , in the form of an encounter between the depraved baron de charlus and the tailor jupien , marcel 's neighbor in the property of the guermantes . later that evening , marcel attends the party , attended also by a cast of characters like very few in literature : charlus himself , a swann close to his death , and others . the dreyfuss cause keeps winning adepts , among them the very prince and princess of guermantes , as the injustice of the sentence is revealed . in the party , marcel continues on his way to disappointment about noblesse : they are people just like everyone else , only with grand names and big egos , but not much more . days later , with his mother , marcel returns to balbec , where , alone in his room he finally feels all the weight and sorrow of his grandmother 's death , which had happened a year and a half before or so . it is a profound passage about the perception of death , everyday indifference to it , and the memories left to us by our beloved 's passing away . in balbec , marcel reencounters with albertine , in that perverted play of seduction and deceit , of attraction and rejection , which foreshadows a sick relationship . disturbed by the graphic discovery of homosexuality , marcel broods a lot about it . two women who stay at the same hotel , and who openly show their lesbianism , awaken in marcel a deep suspicion about albertine 's mysterious life , and so begins a torment of permanent jealousy , of anxiety and anguish which reminds the reader of the similar episode , in times gone by , of the beginning of the relationship between swann and odette . meanwhile , marcel has simultaneous relationships with a couple of maids of the hotel ( literally simultaneous ) . marcel rents a car to go around with albertine through the countryside and the coast , deepening his relationship with the capricious , naughty , annoying and elusive albertine . in her company , he begins to frequent the little band of the social-climbing verdurins ( where swann had met odette years before ) , in the country estate they have rented from the marquises of cambremer . the central part of the book narrates that summer in balbec and its surroundings , above all the wide mosaic of characters surrounding the verdurins : insecure but arrogant doctor cottard and his simple wife ; musician vinteuil ; the rustic and silent sculptor ski ; professor saniette , pathetic and constantly humiliated ; and madame verdurin herself , presumptuous and increasingly successful in society . over this fresco is shown the repulsive couple of charlus and musician morel , son of a former servant of the prousts . morel is the worst kind of climber and representative of sexual and moral corruption . in contrast with what happens in the first three volumes , here it seems that it is the nobles who yearn to be accepted in bourgeois society , and not the other way around . it is the bourgeois who attract interesting people : intellectuals , scientists , artists . charlus makes a fool of himself big time , pretending everybody ignores his homosexuality , when in fact he is the target of cruel jokes and gossip . so continues the great saga of memory , sex , love , longing , and social observation of the xx century . like in no one of the previous volumes , in this one the subject of homosexuality is analyzed in all its complexity . marcel and albertine 's relationship forebodes hell . charlus begins to sink . the bourgeois approach triumph . like in all the previous volumes , what astounds the reader is proust 's immense power of microscopic vision to analyze individuals and dissect societies . it includes a magical reflection on dreams , as well as precious depictions of landscapes , sexual assaults , personalities and emotions
i grew up watching martial arts movies and always wanted to see one that has more depth and meaning . this movie does not follow the sterotypical path of most chinese martial arts films . the actors communicate on many different levels that one would not expect . i was very pleased and inspired by this movie . this will be on the top of my favorites list for many decades
primality know for his somber novels of great moral dilemmas usually in developing world setting , `` travels with my aunt '' is something of a departure for the great graham greene . with its often absurdly situations this is a deeply comic novel rich in humor . the story centers on henry pulling , a recently retired banker . he is stuffy , unimaginative , and not one prone to fun . shortly after he meets his eccentric aunt , who he has not seen since he was a young child , he ends up on whirlwind travels that are best left for the reader to discover for his or herself . suffice to say , however , the novel is very funny and the new world the travels open up to pulling are only one part of the fun . certaily not one of greene 's deeper works , but definetly one of his more entertaining ones . enjoy
i still remember asking my dad to read this story to me every night when i was a child . i am now a <NUM> year old mom of one son and i am looking forward to reading this to him night after night . with wonderful tongue-twisters and places to spark the imagination and the varieties of eggs ... read it early and often
an interesting compilation of examples of the destruction multiculturalism has played on young minds , where a biased political agenda has replaced academics . my only real complaint is that the author - perhaps incorrectly believing that objectivity precludes passion - suppressed her moral outrage
i believe that this is the best song cycle ever written and remains as one of my favourite guettel pieces . the songs on this cd are extraordinary , extremely well written and cleverly assembled . i have also bought the sheet music which confirms his musical genius even further and also contains many songs not on the cd such as prometheus , jesus the might conquerer , life is but a dream and build a bridge , all of which are fabulous . this is a must for all music lovers ! you wo n't regret it
definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best . nothing will ever touch master of puppets in my opinion , but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track . if you 're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else , you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums . however , if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own
i 've just finished page <NUM> , the last page . it 's midnight here in these connemara hills and i ca n't rest . i 'm unsettled . i need to write something about this book . but what ? do i love it ? do i hate it ? in the beginning i felt like quitting after every ten pages , then continuing after the next ten pages , and so on , and so on . i felt myself both repulsed and seduced . eventually i gave in . gave in to nick flynn 's words , sentences , story , language , world , universe . the universe of nick flynn 's disfunctional family : his alcoholic , delusional , absentee father and his suicidal mother , form the foundation of this memoir . in large measure it 's a journey in search of his father , a man who lives by his wits , fuelled by alcohol , driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'great american novel ' ( with a million dollar advance and the nobel prize certainties in that delusion ) , to eventual homelessness on the street . it 's also nick flynn is search of himself . but it 's none of the above . it 's truly a work of literature that sets out , on every page , to capture , and lose , the mystery of the human condition . it 's surreal , a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living . this book finds a kinship with joyce and beckett , and it 's no wonder that nick flynn chooses an excerpt from beckett 's 'endgame ' to open the story : hamm : scoundrel ! why did you engender me ? nagg : i do n't know . hamm : what ? why did n't you know ? nagg : that it 'd be you . you will be haunted by this story long after you 've finished reading it .
i loved the collection.very goo
i really enjoyed this dvd . great moves , beautiful scenes . it relaxed me just watching it . i like the variety of workouts , some easy and some a bit more challenging . something for everyone . i started this because i had a tweek in my back , and after a few weeks i feel much better . i 'm ordering other products from this instructor . highly recommended
keane is one of the greatest bands of all time . the fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song , with no guitars at all , shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that 's out there . there are more than enough guitar-based bands . `` somewhere only we know '' is the best song of all time . beautiful lyrics , solid piano backbone , and a steady , moderate tempo , make it a brilliant album-opener . the album has upbeat pop/rock , like `` bend and break '' and `` this is the last time , '' slow , sorrowful ballads , like `` she has no time '' and `` we might as well be strangers , '' gentle , peaceful melodies , like `` sunshine , '' and slightly ethereal , unearthly ones like `` untitled <NUM> '' and `` bedshaped . '' plus , all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest , ones that everyone can relate to , in one way or another . all together , the album is a classic , one that ( if the american public knows anything about music ) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made . every song is a masterpiece . there are no fillers .
how to get busted in a totalitarian regime : make a film like firemen 's ball . just watched that last night . amazed . brilliant transfer . may not be as poignant as loves of a blonde or his later works , but a rousing critique of the regime with some really funny scenes . but , again , that transfer amazed me . hard to believe it 's a <NUM> year old czech film . highly recommended . enjoyed forman 's comments on the film and the debacle that ensued . he was almost locked up for <NUM> years and was luckily helped out by none other than francois truffaut ! beautiful
scholarship in the field of islamic studies has improved steadily since the <NUM> 's . whereas islam was often viewed as a monolith , and from an orientalist perspective , current scholarship has been more informed of the realities of the religion . unfortunately recent popular media and writing has tended to reverse this positive trend and outlook . many books , articles and classes are back to portraying islam and muslims in terms of divisive characterizations . muslims tend to be viewed as `` fundamentalist '' , modernist or opposed to western civilization . the spiritual dimension of the religion , sufism , is often viewed as outside the core foundations of the religion . the divisive perceptions by both muslims and non-muslims reflect some actual situations but do not contribute to much needed mutual understanding . the authors of this work demonstrate that only with an integrated approach , which includes the depth of the spiritual tradition within islam , may issues in the current crisis be addressed and lasting solutions found . what is unique about this book is that it explains the current situation and crisis we are facing ( particularly as a result of the terrible tragedy of september 11th ) based on a more complete understanding of the islamic intellectual tradition . this tradition always refers back to a metaphysical , meta-historical reality defined not only by islamic revelation , but by all the world 's great religious traditions . it would be easier to simply state positive aspects of islam without rising to the challenge of addressing the specific problems , issues and negative images the western media has confronted muslims with . it is even more rare to see these issues addressed from the perspective of a long-standing intellectual tradition based on sacred texts and writings of eminent figures in the past and modern eras . the authors in this book manage to incorporate sound scholarship and critical analysis using the resources of the spiritual and intellectual tradition of islam to address the difficult questions now challenging the islamic view . the book edited by joseph lumbard includes : a foreword by seyyed hossein nasr ; a qur'anic analysis of the term `` jihad '' by david dakake ; a study of the decline of knowledge based on the islamic intellectual tradition of `` ihsan '' by joseph lumbard ; a response to modern secularism by fuad naeem ; an analysis of the spirit of jihad by reza shah-kazemi ; a view of the roots of modern misconceptions of islam by ibrahim kalin ; an application of game theory as a strategy for dealing with the politics of terrorism by waleed el-ansary ; a muslim response to the social , economic and political impacts of globalization by ejaz akram ; and a perspective on the effects of fanaticism on the muslim community by t. j . winter . this work constitutes a refreshing collection of articles that succeed in stimulating the debate on the current world crisis and in taking account of the problems from an integral approach to islam
i had quite a bit of dance training as a child and teen , but have n't really danced for <NUM> years . also , i 'm a complete beginner at hip-hop , but wanted to learn a little just for fun . and it 's not like i ca n't walk around the block , but i 'd say i 'm a low level of cardio fitness . so this video is absolutely perfect for me right now . i did have to rewind a couple times on my first viewing , and i did n't quite get all the arm and head moves down the first time . but i 'm sure in a few sessions i 'll be doing the moves with some attitude . it 's probably going to get a little boring after a while , but i 'll try and extend the fun period by mixing it up with other videos and activities . at some point it is probably going to get too easy to be a good workout , but that will be a while . she does n't really break down the individual motions for you technique-wise , but they are pretty easy to pick up on . the instructor is a lot of fun , too . the only way this could be better is if there were several different workouts on the disc , or maybe options to extend the combination longer . you 're not getting a ton of content for your money . but i 'm happy with the purchase -- because i just wanted something not too intense and fun , for rainy days and to mix up my workout . one more thing - i consider some of the stretches questionable and dicey at best . i would never , for instance , use my hand to pull my neck into a stretch like she shows . be careful with these and modify them if you need to . i substitute different stretches as needed
a friend of mine challenged me to find an example of a book that displays the one thing that remains southern in our late 20th-century culture , and with eudora welty 's & quot ; losing battles , & quot ; i found it ! southern families have been strung across american since the end of world war ii , but the one thing that keeps us together is the family reunion . welty 's work reconfirms this , and with her gift of conversational writing , created a masterpiece . if you 're lonely for a bit of catching up on family information , even though the one depicted here may not be your own family , this one is it
akira kurosawa 's masterpiece gets the 'do-over ' from criterion . this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film , absolutely no question about it . i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras , let alone watch the movie all the way through . i 'm one of those frame-by-frame , shot-by-shot viewers . i have seen the film several times over the years , mostly on criterion 's original release of the film , this is going way back . if you have never seen this film do n't waste your time with any other version than this one . it does not disappoint . kydu
astronomers detect a large object entering the solar system from deep space . at first it is thought to be just another large rock , but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called rama . a team of scientists blast off from earth to investigate in a ship called the endeavor . what follows is a story of exploration , and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written . who built rama ? what is it 's purpose ? why did it come to our solar system ? the story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship . each new discovery brings new surprises as well . this is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on earth have very different ideas about what rama is , what is represents , and what should be done . this book is , in my opinion , one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written . first published in <NUM> , it remains as fresh as if it were written today . there are several things that i really like about this novel . first , the exploration of rama by the crew of the endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman . discoveries are assimilated , risks are weighed , and the plan evolves . one common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi ( particularly when transfered to tv ) is that individuals of superhuman stature ( e.g . the main character has a ph.d. in astrophysics , was in the special forces , a fighter pilot , and in their spare time a classically trained french chef , a lyric poet , and fluent in ten languages ) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death . this may add drama to the plot , but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic . the characters , while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity , are not absurdly talented beyond reason . second , rama itself is fascinating . clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore . finally , there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of rama that many have tried to duplicate , but none have even come remotely close to succeeding . this book has ` atmosphere ' . early in the novel clarke analogizes the exploration of rama with the opening of tutankhamen 's tomb . there is something wonderful and mysterious about rama that goes far beyond current human understanding , but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection . it is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than <NUM> . in the latter novel , the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible . in rama , the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens . if i had any complaint at all , the novel is a bit short by modern standards . it really seems light at about <NUM> pages , and it would have been nice if clarke had further developed several of the story lines . in any case , this is a book that can be read over and over again . there are very few books that i read a second time , but this has been one of them . in the end , there are more questions than answers , and many of the questions are not resolved . i have not read any of the sequels because i heard they are really bad and i do n't want to spoil this novel . this is one of the novels that put clarke into the great three of sci-fi ( with heinlein and asimov ) , and it won both the hugo and the nebula award . this novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology
toward the end there is some weaker filler-type material , but for the most part this cd contains all the soul you 'd ever need or want . & quot ; hold on i'm-a-comin ' & quot ; is perhaps the greatest single soul statement out there , and there are a half-dozen other essential tracks contained on this disc . my favorite : & quot ; i ca n't stand up for falling down , & quot ; the ultimate picture of a man beaten who wishes to rise up again ... but can not . this is , of course , a love song . what is n't
its difficult to determine where to begin when describing `` submariner '' . this is one of the most richly layered albums i have ever heard , not only that , but there are only three members to the dead science . to start off , the brothers bischoff and vocalists mickens started off as a arty jazz ensemble hitting the clubs in the seattle area . its clear that that jazz background permeates the album but putting your finger on who to compare this style of jazz to is very challenging . when one thinks modern day jazz influenced musical acts with dark overtones , a wide variety of artists that may range from portishead to nostalgia <NUM> , maybe even soul coughing may come to mind . whats amazing is that each one of these bands/artists have left traces of their jazz lineage dna , and yet they sound nothing alike . the same is the case of the dead science 's submariner . this album stands apart though by being surprisingly organic . no scratches , no samples ( not to say there 's anything wrong with those , but ) this is an album that relies on its craftsmanship . let 's take track # <NUM> for example . the song is called threnody , which literally means song of lament , sometimes used in funerals . this threnody called threnody would be the best ambassador to submariner as there is a collective of seemingly sporatic jazz improve . upon closer listening though , one would be able to glean that this is as simultaneously horrifying and beautiful as a giger metamorphasis . there is no conflict of musical elements as a double bass vamping is followed by flat rapid precussion artistry , which is needle-and-threaded with lyrics like `` corpses buried on the banks of the mississippi river '' and `` cell wall divisions corroding under falsities '' . `` below '' , `` white cane '' , and `` the ghost integrity '' are also very strong points to this album , although every song works well together as a well oiled submarsable .
the guys in this band have a sound with size-12 shoes . if you like this band , i suggest you try the allman bros. , lynyrd skynyrd , and creedence clearwater revival . standout tracks are rockin into the night , hold on loosely , wild-eyed southern boys , fantasy girl , caught up in you , if i 'd been the one , back where you belong , and like no other night . the question is : where is this band ? it 's awesome . they need to make a comeback .
<NUM> years of afro-american folklore are represented in from my people , a fine volume gathering a diverse range of tales , from brer rabbit and african motifs to proverbs , recipes , and folk songs . it 's the range of writings which sets from my people apart from competing collections on afro-american oral traditions , making for a comprehensive and important title
it has been roughly one year since this album was released . as of today , i still find myself listening to it regularly , as this cd just has classic written all over it . the opening pair of songs are nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener . queens of the stone age may not have nick oliveri in it , but you can tell that this cd still kicks . all of the elements fall into play , creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind . you will find yourself rocking out with medication and someone 's in the wolf . you may find yourself singing along to the singles little sister and in my head . you may find yourself lamenting to long slow goodbye and i never came . in fact , there is not one bad track on this album . this one can be considered an overview of the band 's output from their inceptiion to today , as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album . that is why this one is amazing . it is definitely queens . it has the stoner grove from the first record , the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort . it also hints at what 's in storage for us fans in the future . lullabies is utterly amazing . the high quality of the songs , as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic . it is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about <NUM> years . do yourself a favor . pick it up . now
i am not a fan of the & quot ; sound of a countertenor or male alto. & quot ; i stumbled upon this recording & amp ; can not stop listening to it and recommending it to friends . scholl 's voice is not & quot ; plummy & quot ; but strong and vibrant and filled with colors . i would love to see and hear him in person-perhaps an opera if this is where he wants his career to go . i am a fan & amp ; have just purchased <NUM> more of his cd 's

this is a heartbreaking epic tale about the difficult road a young woman must travel when she breaks the rules of social acceptance . it 's hard for a modern young woman like myself to fathom that a mere seventy years ago , this was the fate of an unwed mother . elizabeth 's life is turned upside down when she becomes pregnant , and has no idea where the father has gone . social restrictions leave elizabeth with two unappealing choices : admittance into a magdalene convent or marriage to a farmer twice her age whom she has never met . she chooses the latter and is determined to make the best of it , but the harsh , cold , and desolate landscape of her new home is a metaphor for the fate of her marriage . her husband neely , is very possesive and treats her like a piece of property . he is particularly leary of his cousin/ neighbor , mossie , who he calls a `` land grabber '' . they have been fueding for years over the ownership of family property which also gives way to neely 's fearful possesiveness over elizabeth . elizabeth dermot walsh gives a fantastic performance as the fictional elizabeth , who has been so severely beat down yet stays incredibly strong throughout all the tragic twists and turns of her life . the most impressive scene is towards the end when elizabeth kneels at the grave of her stepdaughter and blames herself for her death . that point is the culmination of so many emotions . it shows how elizabeth has given all she can to rectify herself for all the wrong-doing she feels responsibility toward , but at this point feels she has failed . the acting is very powerfull in this scene . i am giving four stars only because i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt . it is sad right up until the end , then there is an admition of love and bam -- a wedding and happy ending . i feel like if you are going to make a movie four hours long there is no reason for an abrupt ending . this is a fantastic movie for anyone with an interest in women 's studies , social influences , period films , or you just want to see a good old fashioned tale of a person rising above so many adversities . if you like this movie , a good supplement would be `` the magdalene sisters '' . it will show you what would have been in store for elizabeth had she admitted herself into the magdalene convent . it is not for the faint of heart though , as it is much more brutal and depressing . it will make you angry , but will give valuable insight into the bleak choices that faced elizabeth in falling for a dancer .
the truth is our society feeds into the so-called need for guns for everything . it is no wonder we 're actually losing the real war on terrorism and further undermining national security . the people who hate this book seem to find it ok to read and listen to gun toting rightwing propaganda all the time . yes , my state is a gun toting state but that does n't mean that none of these people want a little safety once in a while . gun control and gun violence are two different issues altogether despite the nra 's and the rightwing attempts to lump them together . read this book and remember this quote from atticus finch of `` to kill a mockingbird '' : `` courage is when you know you 're licked before you begin , but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what . .. courage is not a man with a gun in his hand . real courage is when you fight for what is right regardless of whether you win or lose .
excellent resourse ! one of the very best , single volume theological dictionaries available . for the size , one of the most concise packages of information . if your interest is in theology , this would be an excellent choice
while i was watching this movie there was one thing i could not get out of my head : it looks as if the script had been written by arturo perez-reverte . this in itself means considerable praise for the director and screenplay writer mateo gil , who adapted a novel by juan bonilla , since perez-reverte is one of my favorite authors . before discussing other aspects of the film , i must say that i did not notice any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers regarding the quality of the dvd . i am not an expert in technology , so the reason for this may be that my dvd player adapts better than others to different formats , but i really do not know . simon cardenas , played by eduardo noriega is a writer suffering from writer 's block , who in the meantime works creating crosswords for a newspaper in seville . at the start of the last holy week of the millennium he gets a strange message on his answering machine . the caller requests that he uses a particular word in a set place in the next crossword puzzle or there will be consequences for simon 's friends and family . the word in question is `` adversario '' , and simon decides to play along ; but this leads to a series of attacks starting with the release of sarin , a poisonous gas , inside a church . simon decides to start investigating and searching for the source of the attacks , and that is how he meets maria , the journalist that is in charge of the investigation for the newspaper . from then on , things get really interesting , when more attacks are noticed , and simon and maria get involved in the action . also , simon 's roommate ( toad ) starts acting weird and has some suspicious items in his possession , leading to a certain level of paranoia in simon . whether this is justified or not , only time can tell . an interesting script and reasonably good performances make this an enjoyable movie . if you like to discover new places , the impeccable sights of the city of seville will give the movie and added flare . for those of you that are used to american thrillers , this film may provide a break from the norm . if you have read authors like perez-reverte , you know what i mean , since in the spanish tradition , you do not always find the extremely twisted plots or the consistent happy endings you see in american films . whether you will get these elements in this movie or not is for you to find out .
this was the key element that helped me pass the exam . books , courses , study groups , ... etc are all good material to cover the understand the concepts . but going through the practice tests on this cd was the single most important factor ! i highly recommend this software to all who are studying for the pmp exam . there are a good number of questions on the cd . it will prepare you for the real thing ! good luck
the alice cooper band 's second album sees the band still recording for frank zappa 's label . the music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous . no real macabre stuff yet , but the album is definitely a progression from their first one . the album was produced by david brigs who is probably best known for working with neal young . the opening track , `` mr. and misdemeanor '' has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of alice 's talent for playing on words . `` shoe salesman '' , `` below your means '' , `` return of the spiders '' , and the short but cool `` refrigerator heaven '' are all good tunes . the finale of `` beautiful flyaway '' and `` lay down and die , goodbye '' is also a great way to end things . the alice cooper band would be signed to capitol and hit the big time with their next release . `` easy action '' would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point .
i love cyndi and this live concert really shows her talent . a great watc
gang starr really put out some classic ish here . this is one of those albums that you may dismay as being sub-par , or even bad first listen if you ar n't into underground , but you soon relize how this album is a gem . dj premeir , and guru have been putting out classic material sence the late <NUM> 's , with there first full album `` no more mr. nice guy '' . premo is widely regaurded as one of the finest producers to ever grace the boards in hip hop history , and his partner in crime guru is known as the king of monotone rap . this is artistically a incredible peice of work . guru & premo put out a style of rap that wasnt commen in the <NUM> 's , and is non-existant now ! a minimalistic producer known for playing a melody of three keys , and a obsession for scratching teaming up with a monotone soft spoken slow tempo rapper . sound like a weird combonation right ? wrong ... if being a hip hop duo was a marrige gang starr would have been couple of the year for <NUM> years straight . this is the type of album you have to spend some time listening to , sure i have my favorite songs of the batch , but they are all solid , and the way premo mixed together the songs , and even transitions is strokes of genius . sure you can listen to `` im the man '' <NUM> times , but you will get the full effect of `` im the man '' in the way gang starr me n't for you to hear it if you listen to the tracks leading to it . everything seems timed perfectly . strong in your face , phony rapper , and conspiracy theorys come in at the proper time for a full listen thru . the interludes are also excellently timed . after hearing `` im the man '' you want something a little chill , & relax , so premo follows it up with `` <NUM> interlude '' a soft short , but sweet <NUM> second paino riff . and even the intro is a great beat , than instead of it sounding like a new track they programmed it to go immediatly into the next track , cause the beats mix together . guru lyrically is sharp , and he does not need much help , with only <NUM> guest appearences , and literally <NUM> guest appearences , sence premo controlls all the hook 's with mastery guru shows his lyrical powress , consistently spitting <NUM> plus bars in his monotone serious voice every track , except the interludes . in this album dj premier seems to be the architect , and guru seems to be the foundation . premier uses his mastery of beatmaking , programming , mixing , scatching , and especially sampling to construct a masterpeice around guru 's lyrics which are the foundation . bottomline , you got ta pick this up if your a hip hop head
putting in pete 's own words ... it 's music for the morning after the day i forgot . i 'd say that sums it up . a great follow up . i perused a friend 's copy of ` day i forgot ' on the way to pete 's house of blues show in cleveland in july . this is signature pete yorn . the disk is filled with obscure lyrics , wandering melodic twists , bizarre arrangements , unorthodox but brilliant production , and lots of guitar . i.e ... everything that should be expected in a pete yorn release . i was really glad i went to the show unfamiliar with this one . i really got turned onto some great new songs at the show . ` all at once ' is the sleeping giant on this disc . an insightful and dark song about his father 's failure to relate to those around him ( i think ) . this album 's ` closet ' has got to be ` burrito ' ( coincidently also track <NUM> ) . if you like pete yorn , you 'll love this one . buy it . my copy 's on the way . i might also urge you avoid saving a buck on a used one and to get a new copy ( cast a vote ) . i do n't mind buying used garth brooks discs , but pete 's still trying to claw his way up . we do want to see a third album .
this was one of the best compilations that i have come across . it starts out powerful and ends a little slow but every song is good and it made memories come back
when prince formed npg he took his music to another level this video expresses that ! .. the way each video is formed ... the color , not that jumping from one scene <NUM> another each member gets his or her chance to show their stuff .. if you are a true prince fan u got to get this video ... do n't be a jughead .. add this one to your collection
every album by a.a. has been good verus the world was great and fate of norns was almost flawless with oden on my side is such a great album from vallhalla awaits me to prediction of warfare.being a member of the astru faith this cd has become like a musical bible for me i listen to this cd alot and bar none no other metal band could touch this album this year.their were many good albums from slayer , celtic frost , hammerfall , cannibal corpse , deicide , sepultura but none of them could touch this cd.my personal faves were cry of the black birds , runes to my memory , and god 's of war arise , this cd gets my vote for album of the year but could be in the running for metal album of the decade .
director stanley kubrick 's first `` major '' film was this vastly entertaining noir , '' the killing '' , dealing with the robbery of a northern california race track engineered by ex-con sterling hayden. ( great ! ) his `` gang '' includes such character actor stan-outs as jay c.fliipen , joe sawyer , ted decorsia , as a dishonest cop , timothy carey ( as a sniper ) , and the noir immortal elisha cook , jr . ( the maltese falcon , the big sleep ) and as cook 's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife marie windsor.miss windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed , but you will never close your eyes while marie is on screen , mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie , which she wares most spectacularly . marie is great as cook 's disguisted wife , who pours out her vemomous insults toward 's her little georgie non stop and without remorse.naturally , she is not ( sexually and otherwise ) satisified with george so she has a younger boyfriend on the side , played by a youthful vince edwards.the plans for the heist are all hush/hush , but george in order in impress sherry ( mw ) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.sherry , who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend 's help , needless to say one seductive glance by marie and edwards is hooked.so when part of the gang meets to split the heist money , hayden is late , the surprise will take place.the robbery goes ok , but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose ! kubrick 's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along , at a fast pace.the film is only eighty minutes.sterling hayden , who at one time i could not stand as an actor ( i was a kid when i thought that way ) gives his greatest performance to date , only to be topped by his role in dr.strangelove ( also directed by kubrick ) , and in the first godfather film , as a dishonest irish police inspector.coleen gray as hayden 's loyal girlfriend is fine , i believe here career should have been more productive , as she should have been given better roles.she her in red river , as wayne 's girlfriend , and as ty power 's naive wife in the noir classic `` nightmare alley '' .but this is marie windsor 's show and she runs away with it ! if you love noir you will love this film !
yea , it 's all about the sellout but who cares . the first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ ss from there . paul leary is quite underrated and gibby haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause . but they still have a lot of weirdness and that 's where some of the filler comes in , but then i never even skip past the german guy . bloodlust said everything i needed to say but i 'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock , like kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals . dust devil is one of my top <NUM> favorite songs ever written . `` got the power of an upright in his g * * * * m hand ! bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
excellent presentation of the material in an easy to follow format . allows the reader to pinpoint exact areas of interest , and contains only information pertainent to the title . a must have for writing resumes with confidence and skill
for those who like the martial arts movies and lots of action this is just the movie for you , jet li is remarkably skilled and very fast with his skill
i bought this season coupple of days ago , and wow , is all i haver to say . it seems like the shows are longer , better acting ( well some scence ) , and i like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast . if you are a knight rider fan like mylself , then this should be in your collection ! !
in `` the masculine marine : homoeroticism in the u.s. marine corps , '' author steven zeeland offers a compelling alternate view of one of the united states ' most revered and recognizable institutions . an `` about the author '' note identifies zeeland as a research associate at the center for research and education in sexuality at san francisco state university . the heart of the book is a series of revealing interviews that zeeland conducted with several marines . his interviewees include both gay and straight men , and one woman marine ; he also includes both officers and enlisted men . particularly interesting is an interview with a gay black navy officer who previously had been an enlisted marine and who , at the time of the interview , was involved in an interracial relationship with a marine corporal . among the many themes covered in the book are marine tattoos , the `` gays-in-the-shower '' issue , marine attitudes about physical fitness and body image , the role of women marines in the corps , boot camp experiences , the `` selling '' of the corps through advertising , gay relationships , the `` coming out '' experience , defining masculinity , and the parallel between marine self-presentation and that of drag queens . a particularly important theme is the unique reputation and mystique of the corps ; in his introduction , zeeland notes that `` marineness is like a religion . '' specific male-on-male sex practices engaged in by marines are frankly discussed and provocatively analyzed . the book also looks at homoerotic rituals and language of the corps . the historical backdrop for the book includes the gulf war , u.s. intervention in somalia , and the beginning of the clinton presidency . the consistently compelling text is complemented by a sixteen-page visual section which explores marine tattoos , haircuts , physiques , and dress . there are photographs from the athletic model guild and other sources . a particularly interesting part of the visual supplement is a 12-panel comic by jerry mills entitled `` poppers '' ; this ironic , richly detailed piece is essentially a complete short story in comic form . the book is full of fascinating anecdotes and observations , both from zeeland and his interviewees . although zeeland is doing a serious scholarly project , complete with end notes , he makes no pretense at scholarly detachment . he notes in his prologue that his research technique involves befriending servicemen -- '' sometimes in an intimate way . '' he is sort of like an extreme jane goodall , passionately connected to the objects of his study . at times his writing and interview questions struck me as too self-indulgent , but in the end he has produced a human document that is both informative and profoundly moving . the book interrogates iconography , challenges stereotypes , and gives gay marines a space to tell their first-person stories . for a companion text , i recommend `` generation kill , '' an account of marines in the iraq war written by embedded reporter evan wright . wright documents some startling examples of marine homoeroticism ; he even quotes one marine as saying , `` man , the marines are so homoerotic . that 's all we talk about . '' like wright , zeeland has produced a truly remarkable contribution to marine corps literature
on r.e.m . 's previous two albums , out of time & automatic for the people , the band created quiet classics by employing a wide array of beautiful instruments including mandolins , harpsichords , strings and the like . they did a complete <NUM> on monster , which is anything but quiet . the album is steeped in the glam-rock of the <NUM> 's and the grunge music of its day . peter buck threw away the acoustic stuff , plugged in and turned the volume up to <NUM> . the band shows off their musical aptitude as this album sounds like nothing they 've done before or since . `` what 's the frequency , kenneth ? '' opens the album awash in buzzing guitars and undesciprable michael stipe vocals . `` crush with eyeliner '' is a glam-rock classic and sounds like it could be out of the david bowie songbook . `` i do n't sleep , i dream '' is a pulsating track while `` star <NUM> '' is straight ahead , tongue-in-cheek rocker . `` tongue '' is probably the band 's sexiest song done in a bump and grind style . `` let me in '' is their tribute to the late kurt cobain . `` bang and blame '' is the best song on the album , with its synthesized sound and popping guitars . monster was the band 's first album to debut at number one and with it , they continued to push the envelope and shake up their identity . this album really benefits from the 5.1 audio as the original album is full of buzzing guitars & distortion and the mix makes for a richer sound
i think this movie is great . the plot is so different from the others . i realy like this movie .
this is an awesome band , and they 've realeased an awesome cd . so it 's not the most technical stuff . it has atmospehere . but ok , let 's bash a band because their music has higher meaning than just cool sounds and constant head bangning . while there are some headbanging tracks on here , a lot of it is about the atmosphere . somehow this music can sound very depressing but with in the same song gives you a sense of hope . it 's a very different sound . probably an aquired sound
it is n't much of a surprise that `` dick '' did not garner much of an audience when it was released in <NUM> on the 25th anniversary of nixon 's resignation . a few years earlier oliver stone 's unintentionally comic `` nixon '' laid a box office egg as well . this hilarious film deserves to be seen because it is just a laugh-out-loud riot . the plot involves two oblivious teenage girls ( kirsten dunst and michelle williams ) who form a friendship with nixon and are employed as his dogwalkers . all goes swimmingly until they unearth tapes in the oval office that reveal that nixon is mean to his dog . the gloves come off at this point . no man who can be mean to his dog deserves to hold the highest office in the land . dunst and williams are bubblingly hilarious as the girls . dan hedaya does a dead-on hilarious rendering of nixon . alot of amusing cameos including will ferrell , harry shearer , and dave foley . great period soundtrack , too . i saw this film originally at a repertory house on a double-bill with `` all the president 's men '' . guess which film left a more lasting impression
`` the president 's analyst '' is a pleasant surprise . it 's a consistently amusing cold-war comedy that lightly tweaks at everyone 's most paranoid fears about espionage , government beauracracy , and monopolistic public utilities among other things . being the sixties , it also sends up suburban liberals , hippies , and yes , psycho-therapy . james coburn is brilliant as the analyst who finds that taking on the job as the president 's analyst makes him the target of competing interests , some benevolent and some not so . the movie really takes hold when his paranoia starts to set in . good supporting cast that includes godfrey cambridge as a u.s. spy and severn darden as an affable soviet spy . my favorite bit has to involve william daniels as the gun-toting self-proclaimed suburban liberal
the original dvd release of `` howards end '' was the no-frills which probably was fine with everyone who has a tight-budget on dvd collection . however , after watching this version has totally changed my mind about criterion dvd editions . now , the picture is crisp and sharper compared to the grainy texture of the original transfer . the scene of leonard bast 's stroll in the meadows of bluebells was so much more dream-like with the magnificent violet and green colors on the screen . also , the music seems to surround all around you compared to the original release which seemed almost like watching on the tv with speakers in your face . you really have to appreciate that such a film gets the attention for being placed on criterion release . actually , this is released through hve which is pretty much sister company of criterion . anyways , the film itself is probably the best production of the merchant-ivory team . its beauty is in its storytelling of the wilcox and schlegel families with the best performace from emma thompson and anthony hopkins . the supporting cast is equally good with helena bonham-carter and vanessa redgrave . you probably will get the most satisfication from viewing the second disc . it has several commentaries from james ivory and ishmail merchant . also , helena bonham-carter tells her hardships with some scenes such as the row boat with the hidden roaring motor and also the rainy return home from a music recital with some trouble from the umbrella . it was also interesting to listen from the production team about the transformation of london into the edwardian period with the scenes and clothing/fashion . overall , this criterion dvd edition is worth every penny if you are a fan of filmmaking . you definitely appreciate the efforts and dedication of merchant and ivory to fund and make such a film . i really ca n't regret this purchase since many times , films do n't get the royal treatment of criterion . oscar-worthy movies are usually quickly released to the masses rather than being tailored for those with higher standards for the dvd viewing experience
i bought this book after i became acquainted with mitford sisters through a biography i have read . after reading the biography , the first novel , `` pursuit of love '' seemed very familiar to me because in some parts it is almost a narration of the mitford history . some characters are given a different history but it is easy to recognize jessica or nancy herself . i would n't go so far as to call these novels masterpieces but they are very witty and enjoyable . especially if you are an anglophile like me , you will most certainly enjoy this humorous depiction of upper class society in england . both novels are narrated by fanny , cousin/friend to the heroines of the novels . `` pursuit of love '' is about linda 's love affairs and `` love in a cold climate '' is about polly 's scandalous marriage . both novels contain very enjoyable side characters like the bellowing uncle matthew , the health-conscious uncle davey and the lovable sissy cedric hampton . in fact the leading ladies are not explored so well as these characters . in the case of polly we know very little about what goes in her mind . i must also note that these novels are more about characters than plots . nancy mitford writes along about the characters and when there is nothing more to say , she abruptly ends the novels . besides if you have n't read them one after the other , some of the points fanny makes will be quite irrelevant as in the case of fanny 's meeting fabrice in `` love in a cold climate '' and mentioning that she will be adopting his son years later . first novel 's heroine linda is just a distant character in the second novel but the other , funnier characters appear in both novels . all in all an enjoyable read but do not expect a literary masterpiece
the movie that started it all - anyone who loves sg1 needs to have this movie
great music ... i have listened to a vast amount of new orlean 's numbers and find this music very entertaining
wow / grape jam is incomplete . so is columbia legacy 's vintage . answer .... buy both albums ( amazon 's other buying options still has some copies of vintage for around $ 15/disc - which in california is a third of a fill up for a camery ) .take the best cuts of both , and put them on a blank disc ( the only song you wont have is the ( very spacy ) the lake , and the announcement to turn your platter speed from <NUM> 1/3 to <NUM> for just like gene autry , a foxtrot that was on the original wow album . this album reminds me a lot of buffalo springfield again . pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band . enjoy . incidentally , you can do this , add the place and the time ( original version - from vintage ) , miller 's blues ( live - from vintage ) , and still have around <NUM> minutes to mess around with . great for a car backup
this was a well-written compilation that provides an overview of the lives and departures of certain notorious film entities over many years . the entries i most appreciated dealt with early icons , now barely remembered if at all , whose names inevitably produce the query : `` whatever became of -- ? '' appreciated even more was the author 's willingness to reach conclusions about an individual 's life and career . he delivered evaluations and even criticisms as warranted . well worth reading - al hooper , edmonds , wa -- al hooper , edmonds , w
as someone new to martial arts but not to stretching , this book is a great resource . years of dance training taught me the importance of stretching but there was a lot i 'd forgotten and some i 'd never learned in the first place . it 's so helpful to have the author explain , in plain english , how stretching works and why some exercises are successful while others are a waste of time . i also found the harder and easier variations for each exercise a big help in modifying some of the exercises to suit what i need as i work on my flexibility at home between classes . highly recommended for anyone looking to become more flexible or just stay in shape .
mr. gray spins quite a story of how he accomplished quite a bit at such a young age . his drive to better his situation , but more importantly help others , is very inspirational . the instances where unscrupulous people took advantage of his inexperience is a critical inclusion in this type of story . this is a good read for teens and people needing an example of how you can achieve if you believe in yourself and never stop working towards your goal
tuch is very insightful in his observations about this syndrome . having been involved in this kind of relationship myself in the past , i can say that his description of how these relationships progress is very familiar . this book will provide well-needed understanding by all involved parties . this understanding is crucial in order to get unentangled from this kind of relationship ... or transform the unhealthy agendas/perspectives that often permeate the relationship and give the relationship a chance to either end or work out
reage 's o is the best-known of the sm novels , one of very few that has made it into the general awareness . this movie is a truncated version of the story , with some interesting differences . a movie is a visual presentation , so many details have been added or filled in . in that respect , the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns , wide ties , and farrah fawcett hair for some of the women . bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s , so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks , too . and , this movie comes from the time when `` safe sex '' meant not falling out of bed . in an effort to approach main-stream audiences , many of the book 's more repugnant elements have been dropped . still , here 's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements . the movie 's pervasive theme of control , submission , and pain is intact . it will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone , and does n't much appeal to me . the very last scene of the movie is a surprise , though . it 's quite unlike the book , and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense . //wiredweir
set in the suburbs of tokyo , `` whisper of the heart '' is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one 's first true love . the teenage main character , shizuku , wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world . while she is a voracious reader , she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view . after meeting a hansome boy , seiji , who both infuriates and intrigues her , shizuku sets a personal goal . because seiji knows he wants to study violin making in italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills , shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer . during the course of whisper of the heart , she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work , one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories . a subplot is shizuku 's relationship with seiji 's grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience . he teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work . he also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending . other than the scene showing shizuku 's writing , the story has none of the strange characters , magic , or fantastic settings of other studio ghibli u.s. releases . ( in my opinion , some of their best real-life style stories such as `` omoide poro poro '' do not translate well into american culture or the american market . ) the animation is fantastic , which i attribute to the detail studio ghibli includes . this is the film which gave rise to `` the cat 's return '' and several of the characters are found in both ( the baron , muuta ) . regardless of the subject matter , i was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling . my wife and i often set the language to japanese with subtitles ( my japanese is abysmal ) and as we found with `` kiki 's delivery service , '' the translation of the japanese dialog is better than what was written for the english version . those with some knowledge of japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story . these include studying for the high school admission tests and the `` goodbyes '' of long-time classmates following junior high school . i found this to be a good family movie and highly recommend it , particularly to anyone with teenage daughters .
here is how i see it . i am a huge fan of one of a kind and spice of life and other bruford albums with yes . this recording has it 's moments and these are memorable moments ! it also has some weak points . but i am going to focus on why you should run out and buy this now . there are two tracks on this cd that are must haves for bruford fans . here is what they are called ... q.e.d and land 's end . these two are killer ! ! the suspense and tension , the release after a build up , the drumming , the incredible guitar and bass work with piano is so satisfying that i would be embarressed to tell you how many times i have listened to these masterpieces . i urge you to listen to these fantastic songs over and over again ! they really are that good . by the way i got to meet bill bruford in oakland at yoshi ( a jazz venue ) last year in the spring and he was so much fun to see with earthworks . anyway if you have not heard one of a kind , buy it now because it is the best jazz album of all time !
one thing i love about deitrick , besides being annointed and a great singer , is that he stick with the themes of his albums names whether it be crossroads , or lost and found every song reflects what a person maybe going through in those stages . nonetheless , crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish . it should have gone a trillion times platinum , but hey he will get his recognition in due time . amen to that . ok , <NUM> days is mainly a celebration ablum , after all god did create everything in <NUM> days and that is something to celebrate about , with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place . do n't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier . just imagine `` god is good '' mixed with `` unity '' mixed with `` god did n't give up on me '' through a whole album . this is the best way to explain it . deitrick my friend , you are my favorite gospel artist and truely annointed . i thank god for you everyday , amen to that . thank you deitrick for obeying the lords will to make wonderful music and most of all i thank god for creating you to make this wonderful music . all glory is yours jesus ! amen and amen . go and get it !
do n't listen to the other reviewers this is the original soundtrack for the film when harry met sally . buy it and enjoy it
i first got believe it as a used record in the late <NUM> 's . wow ! this cd includes <NUM> rather short lps , but you are getting it for the first one - believe it ! which was the single best hard-fusion record ever made . it 's also a great bridge from the world of rockers dabbling in jazz ( bruford 's early band , brand x , etc . ) to a real jazz outfit that happens to rock hard . i never tire of listening to this one with it 's wonderful blend of tony 's great drumming , some of the best guitar work holdsworth has ever done and just enough funk to keep it from ever getting too serious . buy it and crank it up
rippington 's during the period moonlighting was made were the epitomy of jazz fusion with latino flair . fusion today is milk toast compared to this cd . `` soft jazz '' has become the term for bands and artists of this genre , and it fits . all radio friendly and crossover hopeful . this cd smokes with vibes , fast guitar , syncapated rythyms , and memorable melodies . toe tapping and should be played twice in a row to let it sink in . russ freeman is the most under-rated jazz guitarist of his time . he is never mentioned with carlton , rit , lorber , dimeola , etc ..... he is a great songwriter and his music appeals to all that listen , old and young alike .....
i 'm just starting out . i have tried to get into other video workouts and i just ca n't . i screw up every dance maneuver or `` walking '' based move they throw at me . debbie does the workout so that i ( as a complete clutz and i hate exercise because i feel stupid that i 'm not coordinated ) feel like i can do it again . i like her telling me about coaching because i need it . if you need encouragement for getting started this is a great place to start . there is also a <NUM> min . cd you can use for outdoors . i do n't need cute or chatty or some aerobic glam girl . this is a great place to start . i ca n't see myself doing only this video , but give it a go . it 's definately motivated me for <NUM> days solid .
bravo for mr. herman ! his perspective on the affect of the british raj and , in particular , the navy on the development of the western world is excellent and educational . the phenomenon of a relatively small nation exerting its influence around the globe by extending its power through a superbly constructed and manned navy is , as yet , unmatched . for fully two centuries , until world war ii finally exhausted the potential , the british policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the new world through trade with the old . this includes the united states , whose loss as a colony severely dented the empire , but eventiually created the power which has succeeded britain as world guarantor . mr. herman is good on detail , but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole . he is candid about the problems , both physical and political , and respectful of those individuals who , even in bad times , retained the foresight to keep the navy , and , thus , the empire , on an even keel . an excellent read for anyone interested in western history
i am very pleased with this cd and i received it quickly . recommend this seller highly .
just wanted to say my mom liked this album so he has changed tremendiously . thats al
several websites told me the blazing saddles that came in the box set was the 30th anniversary edition . it is not so just be ready
alfred hitchcock was n't too good at straight-out comedy , which he only did once . but he was absolutely brilliant at clever , witty thrillers , one of the earliest of which is `` the lady vanishes . '' while it has some major plot holes , hitchcock makes up for those with witty dialogue and solid acting . iris ( margaret lockwood ) is having a last girl's-night-out with her best friends , at a small alpine hotel . as she 's leaving on the train , she befriends a kindly little old governess ( dame may whitty ) -- who vanishes while iris is napping . even worse , everyone denies that the old lady existed , making iris wonder if she imagined the whole thing . she enlists the help of eccentric musician gilbert ( michael redgrave ) to help her find the old lady , once they are both convinced that the lady existed . now the pair must go through the train in search of the old lady -- but they never expected to uncover an international conspiracy , which could leave them all dead . `` the lady vanishes '' was a pretty early movie of hitchcock 's , and at the end we 're left wondering about several oddities in the plot ( how is an eighty-year-old lady so athletic ? how inept can those foreign agents be ? ) . as a spy thriller it 's flawed but passable ... but it 's very good as a comedic mystery . hitchcock takes his time introducing us to these characters , by having them all bunk at one overcrowded hotel . one particularly funny scene has gilbert invading iris 's suite , after she has him ejected from his room , and strewing his things all over as she orders him to leave . but hitchcock also captures the claustrophobic feeling of being menaced on a train . as well as the feisty socialite and weird musician , the movie is sprinkled with cricket-obsessed brits , ebullient hoteliers , and bickering adulterous lovers . they all do fairly solid jobs , with redgrave as a charming , slightly odd standout . and they all get some entertaining dialogue , no matter how stodgy they are . ( `` my father always taught me , never desert a lady in trouble . he even carried that as far as marrying mother . '' ) you 'd expect criterion to do the best job with this film . but in terms of quality for your money , i found that the diamond entertainment version is pretty good . the picture is fairly clear , neither too light nor too dark , and the soundtrack is clean except for a slight crackle in the opening credits . not too bad for a mere four dollars . `` the lady vanishes '' is a comedic mystery that does n't quite work as a spy thriller . but it 's still an entertaining , taut little movie . definitely a keeper
the documentary was really , really good . they left some stuff out of it , of course , but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense . one thing i did not remember was the prodigious mullet brian sported back in the day . man , i think that thing was more impressive than jagr 's cup-winning mullet of the early-90s ! i do n't know that i learned anything new from the documentary , but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing . also , stone cold talking about the hollywood blonds tag team was great fun . they really played up the flyin ' brian stuff as being ahead of it 's time ( which it was ) and the loose cannon character that had everyone guessing . funny thing is that the whole loose cannon thing was n't really long-lasting if you think about it . the gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill . the accident was glossed over -- he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend 's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed -- but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not . he knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him . anyhoo , the official coroner 's report was that he had a heart attack ; just as his dad had at a young age . of course , the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over . i mean , the wwe is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a ( ahem ) `` sports entertainer '' is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job . it 's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale . the truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him , he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in . best parts were reliving the hollywood blonds stuff . i remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and steve were going to be huge stars . steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in wcw . they never name the booker but i am <NUM> % sure that it was ric flair back then who headed the booking committee . i am also <NUM> % sure that arn was on the committee too . they must have felt threatened by the flare for the old skit that set up a <NUM> out of <NUM> falls match for a tbs special in ( i am guessing ) <NUM> or <NUM> . great stuff though ; and brian came up with the whole gimmick . they were so hilarious together . another great part was jim ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to brian in the wwf . that was sad stuff . jr really had a hard time trying to help brian but pillman only saw the fact that jr order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal . overall , i am going with <NUM> crutches out of <NUM> . i have n't watched any of the matches as yet but i am less interested in that kind of thing than i am the documentaries .
the songwriting on this album is really good , the level of musical ability of the band is high , and the hits are solid . the album comes out of the gate with a bang due to the single `` puedes contar conmigo '' . i think our local pop station here in atlanta has overplayed `` rosas '' , but it is a classic . amaia has a sweet and alluring voice , however a whole album of it will tire you out . this is not something you will want to listen to from beginning to end . i would suggest they let other band members sing <NUM> or <NUM> of the songs on their next album to break the monotony . amaia can sing and definitely should lead the singing ( plus she is a good songwriter ) , though . perhaps this is why julieta venegas ' albums are short - to keep her fans from tiring of her distinct , recognizable voice . this album proves why they are a supergroup with enormous popularity . its worth spending the money to buy the album , but one must strongly consider buying las canciones individuales if they are not a major fan
what an album . easily one of my favorites . it 's one that deserves to be listened to on a high end music system . i have my albums that i like on my ipod , or in the car . this is one i like to dedicate my time to without distractions . bought it the day it came out and has only gotten better with time . my musical tastes usually fall within the electronic/downbeat domain ( air , boards of canada , herbert , fila brazilla , autechre .. etc ) i do own listen without prejudice , but older is a much more sophisticated , well rounded album . mr. michael 's vocals are smooth and lush . first review i 've ever done on amazon , could n't have picked a better album to start with .
to be honest , the firm is n't one of my favourite series . often , there are instructors not giving clear cuing and they can be out of time . for some reason , i decided to give this a go and i 'm glad i did because it 's one of the better workouts of theirs . there is lots of variations in movements and music so it 's kept fresh and interesting . for once i found the cuing very very precise and right on time . the instructor , alison davis , not only cues well to let you know what 's coming up , but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique . the mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and i 've found results already . it 's a little over <NUM> minutes all up , and all you need is two sets of dumbbells . it 's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level . it 's fun and i like to do this once or twice a week along with my other routines and dvds . i thoroughly recommend this
what can i say , on a scale of <NUM> thru <NUM> this movie goes to <NUM> !
all i can say is wow ! this is ricky schroeder ? no way ! rick does an unbelievable job in this movie and proves himself to be a true actor worthy of extreme praise . the story line is excellent and true to the actual event the movie is based upon . they spent the time and got all the details right on this one , the historical accuracy is extremely impressive . this is not a `` chick flick '' as it has a lot of intense close quarter combat , which is not the case with many modern wwii films . that makes some parts of the movie a bit graphic and nasty , but wwi was graphic and nasty . the hand-held camera work is a bit jumpy and almost too over-the-top in trying to place you `` into '' the action at times , but the movie is certainly good enough to overcome the overzealous camera work . if you want to know something of wwi combat , there 's not a better movie out there right now - at least that i know of . with all due respect to `` all quiet on the western front '' of course - both versions . the lost batallion should be in any military enthusiast 's collection .
i am continually amazed at the huge variation in people 's tastes . someone can give a <NUM> star rating and the next a <NUM> star rating for the same film . i can be touched by a film so deeply and yet the person sitting next to me feels nothing . i guess it proves how different we all are . & quot ; the sacrifice & quot ; touched me . i would rank it amongst the best <NUM> films i have ever seen . the film is mysteriuos , haunting , slow paced , impecably filmed and acted . so many images remain in my mind . the woman who breaks down and has to be pacified by a tranquilizer , the haunting music associated with the witch that permeates throughout the movie , the long take as the house is burned etc etc . this is a truly great masterpiece . what a shame tarkovsky died so young
this is the best science book in the world , and i do n't even like science . the book keeps me entertained and i love it . i love it so much i am not going to re-sell it after my class ends and save money . i would rather keep the book .
this book is of the highest quality , from its hard cover , to its glossy pages , to the photographs and historical records . this is the most detailed account of urban warfare in stalingrad i have ever read . the book is fast-paced , easy to follow , thoroughly researched , and extremely informative . i could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in stalingrad than from all the other books i have read combined . if you want to learn about the horrific fighting in stalingrad from a first-person perspective , this is the highest quality work i have encountered . i recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed . a first class historical work all the way . impressive ! ( on a side note , i specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference . so , i have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue .
richard cheese and lounge against the machine have done the obvious , obviously . while not strictly as bad as william ( bill ) murry 's obnoxious lounge act , nor as over-the-top as the late andy kaufman 's tony clifton persona , ` richard cheese ' keeps his performance within the character 's velvet rope guidelines , and instead minimizes and only slightly deconstructs the classic lounge song . this is neither sinatra nor bennet , nor is it your little brother doing a bad imitation of them . this is serious lounge , yet alternative . like waking from a familiar dream , richard cheese 's renditions are still recognizable , yet obviously something `` other '' , and yet as pure as the originals . richard cheese and lounge against the machine , therefore , are not tribute creators in another style , like dred zepplin , for they are members of their genre . they also are not a joke on the genre within the genre , as was the lamented `` nig heist '' within the touring `` black flag '' shows of the early 80s . neither do they make ` lounge ' more ` lounge ' with overproduction , digital techniques , and rich strings . indeed , minimalism and limited range are the bywords . or perhaps it is driven by a small production budget . and the obvious question must be answered : is richard cheese `` cheesy ? '' only in the sophomoric dimensions of a joke as obvious as a goiter , where we cry out `` dick cheese ! '' in the same breath that we call `` mike hunt ! '' over a smoky crowd of strapless cocktail dresses , and elicit a few titters . cheesy , yes , but the music does compel repeated listening , like alex chilton covering `` more '' with bobby darrin 's shade speaking through the whisky , there is something there , there . but richard cheese and lounge against the machine are not cocktail classics to spin when you have the smoking jacket on and the new recruits from the secretary pool dropping by your place after the show , for this lounge set speaks more to the ` cocktails made with codeine ' set of cool . and yes , i am dying to know what sir-mix-a-lot thinks of this version of `` baby got back .
this has to be his best cd . not to long , not too short , unbelieveably funny ! the comedian is live , uncensored , at his raunchy best . we miss you , sam . rip
since they decided to release spongebob season <NUM> in two volumes , this one will contain all the remaining episodes that were n't featured on volume one . the episodes to be featured on this dvd will most likely be : <NUM> . chimps ahoy <NUM> . whale of a birthday <NUM> . karate island <NUM> . all that glitter <NUM> . new leaf <NUM> . once bitten <NUM> . bummer vacation <NUM> . wigstuck <NUM> . squidtastic voyage <NUM> . that 's no lady <NUM> . best day ever <NUM> . the gift of gum <NUM> . rules of dumb <NUM> . driven to tears <NUM> . burn to be wild <NUM> . squidwood <NUM> . best frienenemies <NUM> . the pink purloiner <NUM> . uncle sherm 's visit <NUM> dj patric
murphy was at his best in this . this was the era where eddie murphy was the `` it '' guy . everything he did turned to gold . and back then , this was gold . samuel l. jackson was unknown in the eighties even though he was earning his living out of acting in hollywood films . at the beginning of this movie he plays the father of eddie murphy whose raw , cutting edge humor raises eyebrows and complete silence amongst his family . i have watched `` raw '' many times and found it very funny to a point . the last <NUM> minutes are kind of dull , and not much , if any laughs but it 's pretty much a laugh riot up until the last <NUM> minutes or so . the funniest parts include the bill cosby , and richard pryor imitations , and the part about eddie wanting a mcdonald 's hamburger as a kid . even when it loses its momentum toward the end , i still watch this disc just for that .
i found this book unsatisfactorily casual and slap-happy for the work of putative been-there-done-that expert with such lengthy tenure in and around things ufological . yet , by reading this , i did manage to concretize a philosophical system that has been emerging for years as i read one ufo book after another -- while also reading widely in other things paranormal , as well as a spate of less abstract fields , such as history , science , linguistics , anthropology , and such . let us posit that aliens ( <NUM> ) exist ; ( <NUM> ) have the technology to visit remote star systems ; and ( <NUM> ) took greatly enhanced interest in earth only when it developed weapons systems capable of either harming other civilizations ( i.e. , in combination with its rocket technology ) or of destroying itself ( which would constitute a crying shame from the viewpoint of fundamentally beneficent aliens who respect other sentient life forms ) . keyhoe leads me to believe -- amid his conspiratorial musings and his subtle hints at what was meant by what was really meant by what mr. x thought that mr. y intended -- that they are watching us and executing a hands-off policy until such time that we pose a direct , immediate danger to ourselves ( this will occur long before we pose a direct and immediate danger to exocivilizations ) , at which time -- starfleet-style `` prime directives '' od non-interference notwithstanding -- they will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the harmonious continuation of our culture . whether that means utterly conquering and enslaving us , or surreptitiously seizing control over certain key organs of our governments ( possibly to include forging certain elements of the whole-earth government whose existence einstein endorsed as a logical and necessary eventuality ) , or just providing cultural `` guidance counselors , '' who can really say . it is indeed food for thought to ponder the likely -- well , the possible -- archetypal alien ethos and surmise what it might intend for us and why it should , or will , occur when the time requires it
born romantic cuts a slice of life out of london life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types . and it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive . the homing center for these disparate people is a salsa club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not , they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue . one woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance , another is a bisexual who fears relationships , another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male . the men are equally edgy , from a scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman , to a atm robber , to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch . how they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey . the acting is excellent , the timing first rate , and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the londoners , just turn on the english subtitles and you wo n't miss a thing . a lovely film full of surprises
tommy and tuppence are certainly my favorite agatha christie crime stoppers , and francesca annis and james warwick give wonderful portrayals of the fun and brilliant pair .
this book is absolutely the best place to start if you want to learn about medieval castles . it explains in very accessable prose how medieval castles came to be , how they evolved , the roles they served in medieval society , what they were like at their zenith , how military strategy through the middle ages centered around the castle , and how their relevance declined with the changes in technology and the political scene that came with the late medieval period . the gieses give the reader a very clear picture of what life was like for the people whose lives centered in or around the castle , from the nobility at the top down through the staff needed to keep the castle running to the villagers at the bottom . in particular , it shows the various functions that the castle staff needed to serve in order to keep things running smoothly , and the duties of those responsible for those functions , from chamberlains , chaplains , seneschals and stewards down to pantlers , haywards and reeves . in many cases , the best things are the historical anecdotes used to show a particular aspect of castle life , from the manner in which meals were served to the ways provisions were acquired in an era where money was by no means a common exchange , and how matters of jurisdiction often overlapped in problematic ways ( a lord might have jurisdiction over a castle but not over the forest surrounding it which belonged to the king ) . this is not what i would call the definitive text on all aspects of castle lore , but it is probably the single best place to start to get a clear and detailed education on , as the title indicates , `` life in a medieval castle . ''
i love it ! ! but then again , i love all his cd 's , he is the best at what he does ! have seen him several times in concert , and if you ever get a chance to see him , do it ! ! it will be well worth the $ $
there are so many different songs to choose from on this cd and it 's a great buy . whether you want to play it while eating dinner at the wedding , to walking down the isle , it 's wonderful ! ! !
a exellent book on teaching with a non political veiw . i was very impessed with the author 's over all out look . this books teaching technique 's can be applied to any style
john is a top medium his book is like been in the show well written and a comfort to read as all the others , his personality shines in one last time , i do believe there is more , another book the calling of your true self elizabeth anne bell is another book i could not put down it also rings with truth both well worth reading
continuing the high standard set by the quality of episodes from the third season , season <NUM> of star trek : the next generation maintains a high standard throughout . the conclusion of the previous season 's cliff-hanger `` the best of both worlds '' does not disappoint , it 's the rollercoaster finish we were all hoping for . it does n't end there though , the writers were brave enough to not have the next episode be `` back to normal '' as star trek is so good at doing but write a real character episode `` family '' mainly dealing with picard 's trauma after being assimilated by the borg . there are n't any terrible episodes this season , qpid is a bit silly with the crew as robin hood characters - most of the stories are strong . `` future imperfect '' continues the brinkmanship between the federation and the romulans ( with andreas katsulas of babylon <NUM> fame and riker telling picard to `` shut up '' ) , `` data 's day '' is an entire episode from data 's perspective , `` the wounded '' introduces us to the cardassians , `` first contact '' is what star trek 's all about , then we get into `` the mind 's eye '' and `` redemption '' where the romulan , klingon and federation triangle plot finally starts to come out .
this is bob dylan at his very finest and this is probably his best record , from `` like a rolling stone '' to the album 's closer , `` desolation row , '' the listener is assaulted with blistering images in rhyme that she will never forget . dylan changed the shape of the musical landscape with this record , changed rock and roll forever . his songs broke the three minute mold , they were n't about love and love lost anymore . in fact some of them are darned hard to understand , but they stay with you none the less . bob dylan was , and is , the poet laureate of rock and roll , the poet laureate of america . love after we 're all gone , his lyrics will be sung , recited , read
to really get an artist 's personality , sometimes you need to see them live . i do n't know if that 's true with johnny but i know it sure does n't hurt . this is a very young johnny with luther and marshal . three friends , lots of fans , and a set of songs that you 'll probably recognize from his few albums that were out at that time . yes , there are several repeat performances but nothing really overshadows the fact that you get to see this piece of music history . it does n't take any of the shine off it is what i 'm saying . complete with some teasing onstage banter and a one or two minute bout of outright goofyness as johnny imitates an anonymous singer ... if you ca n't figure out that it 's elvis he 's impersonating ... than you do n't know elvis and you were born in a cave . this is not a rock and roll show by any means . it 's perfect and original country concert and what a collectors item . a real treasure . glad i got a hold of a copy . no problems with audio or visual quality . for the time period , having to turn the volume up a little extra is not an issue [ for me atleast ] . enjoy
this book ( the cover amazon has displayed is * wrong * ) is very interesting . it is also exceedingly strange . it was never boring , but it never made too much sense either . you think there might be supernatural elements involved -- but maybe not . it 's a tale of the coming to america from england , the stuff that happens to the british here , and indians . cool , confusing , book
i 'm only half way through this book but i think it has some really great information . my dh and i are planning to adopt but have n't officially started the process yet . this book is giving us lots of issues to think about . it provides good examples of positive language for discussing adoption with your child . the author does n't shy away from the hard issues like racism or a history of incest . she does a great job of integrating child/teen development into all issues . she cites many studies to support her advice . the writing is rather dry ( much like my own ) and academic , which is actually useful . i trust this author because her writing is n't colored by a lot of emotion . she uses plenty of real-life examples from the experiences of adoptive families . the book does suffer a little from being broad and trying to address all flavors of adoption ( domestic & international , same race and transracial ) . i highly reccomend this book to anyone considering adoption as a way to start conversations with your spouse about the hard issues you will face as adoptive parents . might even be a good idea to share it with extended family
not only useful for the & quot ; serious adult & quot ; improv artist -- as a drama teacher who works with underprivileged kids i find this the best book out there for helping them develop a sense of & quot ; mastery & quot ; on stage , a drama more alive to them than memorizing lines . recommended for anyone who works with young actors
because the enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in american history , this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms . more importantly , this documentary shows how the american criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations . as a result of the aforementioned , i use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike .
this is one of the most innovative , talented bands that 's come along in a while ! if you like dream theater , rush or queensryche you 'll love these guys ! also , check out their newer albums deadwing & in absentia ! absolutely brilliant
this is a finely crafted album , it 's just beautiful . background harmonies from dolly parton , emmylou harris , ricky skaggs , vince gill , amy grant , trisha yearwood .... patty is fantastic on her own , but with these voices blended in , something special was created .
me oh my , what an outrageously good record this is . i had never heard of the stone roses until my brother played me & quot ; i wan na be adored & quot ; a few years ago . i loved the song , but i thought they would be a band very much like the smiths or the cure ( which is n't a bad thing at all , i just was n't interested at the time ) , so i never followed up and bought any of their albums . thankfully , my father received this cd from my brother for his birthday a few months ago , and i 've had the pleasure of listening to it everyday since then . all of these songs exude an indomitable vitality that lends an extra cachet to the already stellar music . there is a distinctive 80s sounds to the roses , but after listening to all the material present on the very best of , it 's apparent that these songs transcend their era and will always remain as timelessly great pop confections . highlights of this recording include the ebullient & quot ; what the world is waiting for & quot ; , the dreadfully pleasing & quot ; i wan na be adored & quot ; , and the anthemic numbers & quot ; made of stone & quot ; and & quot ; i am the resurrection & quot ; . i highly recommend this to all
fleetwood mac in the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's were the biggest band on the planet . with a new line-up that included stevie nicks and lindsay buckingham they owned the music world . rumors is still on the top <NUM> best sellers of all-time . this compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well . silver springs was recorded during the rumors sessions . stevie nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album . mick fleetwood did not allow her to use the song . it was later recorded for the dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's the version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for rumors in the 70's its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on rumors . fleetwood mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music . this is for the serious fleetwood mac fan who wants to hear rare gems , and cant not get enough of their classic songs
hallinan 's book presents a balanced tour of the basic knowledge required for an embedded linux design effort . the subject is exceedingly large and the author wisely chooses to focus on essentials such as tools , debugging , and architecture . there is less emphasis on quickly dated material such as source code tours and build instructions as is found in other texts . this book will add to your knowledge ... not just your script library . two attributes of this text are notable : a ) this is the only text on the market with an overview of the latest config_rt technology found in the linux kernel . config_rt is a new way of reaching real time performance requirements that does not depend on sub-kernels or interrupt abstraction . b ) the author remains true to making this a `` primer '' . this is an ideal book to start with and lay the foundation for future learnin
to to be totally honest , i only saw this movie once . it was in <NUM> when i was <NUM> years old . yes , we snuck into the theatre . i remember the warnings at the time. `` completely concerned with disgusting gory violence '' those warnings were very true . this movie is not for those with queasy stomachs for there are a number of scenes which could make the average person puke . that is providing they are not edited out for this upcoming release . one being where baron frankenstein says , `` to know life , one must f ... the gallbladder '' which he does after cutting open the female frankenstein monster . the lopping off of a head with curved shears was a good one too . the fact that this movie was originally in 3d made for some good close ups of intestines and livers as well . too bad the dvd will not be in 3d . as with most classic horrors , the acting is not deserving of any awards , but i believe that any collector of horror/gore flicks should cosider this movie
this is an interesting allegorical tale . david hemmings , in one of his best roles , represents the instinctual nature of the ordinary man with no greater aspirations other than to enjoy the pleasures of life . as political and military figures `` wave the flag '' to the beat of their own political persuasions , loyalty unto death to those political persuasions is the only proof of loyalty to one 's country . men die in this film and it is not all for queen and country .
j'adore et je suis contente d'avoir pu commander cette superbe série en vost ! amazon est rapide et fiable

once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece . aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever , followed by the live favorite <NUM> minutes to midnight another solid rocker . the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs , that are all pretty much straight forward rockers . then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions . then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner , the second best epic they have . this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden . up the irons ! !
madman across the water . wow ! this is an essential elton john album . by now , most are familiar with the opening track , tiny dancer . beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this , my favorite elton john tune ( and i have many ! ) . levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album . this is less a collection of singles with filler as e.j . has been accused of creating later in his career . taken as a whole , this album is simply a masterpiece . madman was created before the flashy goodbye yellow brick road days , with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it . here 's you get the feeling of a new artist , hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack . he 's succeeded with this effort and has n't looked back since . if you 're a partial e.j . fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work , madman across the water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice
when it comes to `` best of 's '' and compilations , very rarely can a collection successfully comprise a solid overview of a band 's catalog . the smashing pumpkins ' `` greatest hits '' is one of the few of these collections that actually satisfies , providing a very solid overview of the songs that propelled the band to stardom . singles from `` gish '' to `` machina : the machines of god '' are covered here , as well as `` eye '' from the soundtrack to david lynch 's lost highway , and unreleased songs `` real love '' and `` untitled '' , which are actually pretty good as well . the only real downsides to this compilation are that no other non-singles are covered here , and the cd booklet features no kind of commentary at all from any of the band members . that aside , for casual fans of the smashing pumpkins , `` greatest hits '' is n't a bad pick up at all
time and a word ( <NUM> . ) the second yes album . introduction : yes first came onto the musical scene in <NUM> , with the release of their self-titled debut album . the collaboration between singer jon anderson and bass player chris squire showed serious potential with the release of that first album . sadly though , it was overlooked by the music-loving public of the day . the band would make it big , but that would take a few more years . the band 's <NUM> sophomore album , time and a word , was equally overlooked , sadly enough . so , just how does the second album from the classic progressive rockers fare ? keep reading , and you shall see . overview : -time and a word was released november of <NUM> . -the album was produced by tony colton . -the album 's tracklist consists of no opportunity necessary no experience needed , then , everydays , sweet dreams , the prophet , clear days , astral traveller , and time and a word . -the band on this album consisted of vocalist jon anderson , drummer bill bruford , bassist chris squire , keyboardist tony kaye , and guitarist peter banks . the band here was unchanged from the debut album . this was peter banks ' last album with yes ; he 'd be replaced by steve howe for the band 's next album . review : the two albums yes did before steve howe joined the band are , without question , the most underrated works they ever did . it 's a shame these albums get so overlooked , because they are nothing short of excellent . all eight tracks this album serves up are among the band 's finest , and certainly among their most unique . i was n't sure what to think of this album due to its somewhat mixed reputation , but one listen to it showed me that this was one of the finest progressive rock albums of its time . the songs on here sound nothing like anything the band had done prior or sense , meaning this is arguably the band 's most unique-sounding album . these tunes are tough to describe and to put into words , but i 'll do my best . the band kicks things off with one of my all-time favorite songs they ever did - no opportunity necessary , no experience needed . the songs combines classical-style orchestration with the classic organ-heavy prog rock this version of yes is noted for . a solid opener , indeed . and then we move on to the second track on the album , then . the underrated bill bruford is the star of the show here - his rapid drumming in the verses simply must be heard to be appreciated . and tony kaye 's keyboarding is excellent , too ( it 's a shame he gets overlooked in favor of the more popular rick wakeman most of the time . ) next up is everydays , a cover of a buffalo springfield tune . like most of the band 's covers , the song itself stays true to the original , but it gets a total revamp with plenty of organ playing and extended instrumental portions . and believe it or not , i just might like this version of the song more than the original ! and then we have sweet dreams . i 've always like this tune , because it 's somewhat of the happy medium between the band 's early pre-howe material and the more popular stuff that would come later . another underrated yes tune . track five is the prophet , one of the best songs on the album . the first half is instrumental , and peter banks and tony kaye beautifully demonstrate their musical abilities on their respective instruments ( it 's a shame these guys got so overlooked in favor of their successors . ) once again , the song implements elements of a classical-style , orchestral piece , and as a whole this makes the song better . following that tune , we get to clear days , the sixth song on the album . this is a slow and melodic piece with a low-pitched violin backing anderson 's vocals . it 's probably the most baroque-sounding thing yes ever did . it 's a shame they did n't make this song longer and a little more developed , because it could have been a masterpiece . still , it 's very good the way it is . seventh on this album is astral traveler . the song 's sound is absolutely brilliant , featuring a sort of `` space rock '' sound that sounds like the band 's later material , but at the same time it sounds totally different . hard to describe this song , but it 's a good one ! closing things out is the title track . this is a slow , melodic track with excellent backing instrumentation . it definitely brings the late beatles sound to mind . overall , this track makes for a damn good finisher . and in the end , time and a word stands as one of the band 's underrated masterpieces . edition notes : in the early twenty-first century , the yes catalogue got a much-needed reissuing . the new versions of the albums feature remastered sound , expanded liner notes , and bonus tracks . these new versions of the albums on cd kill older cd issues dead . if you do n't have the albums yet , be sure you get the remastered ones ! overall : in the end , yes proves that they had the ability to make excellent music from the very beginning . who cares if it does n't sound like the band that most people know and love ? the music itself flat-out rules . it also goes to establish just how talented the underrated tony kaye and peter banks are - it 's a shame their successors in yes get all the credit from most fans . oh , well . final verdict ? if you 're new to yes , you might want to start with the yes album or fragile . this is a great album , no questions asked , although there are better starting points . that said , though , this is a solid album through and through , and it belongs in the collection of every yes fan .
the theme played throughout the film is by edward shearmur , who also did numerous scores for motion pictures like `` the count of monte cristo '' , `` k-pax '' and `` sky captain and the world of tomorrow ''
i could not put this one down . the autism spectrum is so diverse and difficult to understand . this book allows one to get into the mind of a child with autism and get a grasp on how he/she perceives the world around them . things we say and do on a regular basis , are perceived very differently to someone with autism for a variety of reasons which this book covers . activities that we may enjoy , sometimes , are simply too much , even nausiating at times for someone with autism . these `` ten things '' that the book mentions , really opens ones eyes to a whole different way of understanding and interacting with an individual with autism . it really showed me better ways to communicate with them . for anyone at all that has or is working with someone on the spectrum , you need to read this book . it will help you to be more sensitive and them better . thank you for this book
anna netrebko has rapidly become a first tier star in opera . this album , her first at dgg , illustrates why some rate her so highly ; it also illustrates some of the questions that some have raised about her . all in all , though , a very nice cd . a few selections illustrate : mozart , idomeneo , `` quando avran fine omai . '' she displays a rich and clean voice . there is a very attractive quality to her voice manifest in this work . mozart , don giovanni , `` crudele ? ah no , mio bene ! ... non mi dir . '' this is donna anna 's poignant aria , given her circumstances . netrebko displays rich tones . this is a well sung cut . `` non mi dir '' shows off some agility in her voice . donizetti , lucia di lammermoor . `` ancor non giunse ! . . .regnava nel silenzio . . .quando rapito in estasi '' something of a disappointment . coloratura is not her forte ( and see her `` sempre libera '' cd for further confirmation ) . she clearly shows off a rich and lush voice . i think that she displays some characterization here that is compelling . she hits high notes cleanly . but her ornamentation is indifferent , and she appears unable to trill . i know , some say that that is irrelevant . but compare beverly sills ' version of this work , with almost too many trills extraordinarily well sung and her florid technique , and this version simply pales . bellini , la sonnambula . `` care compagna . . .come per me sereno . '' again , netrebko displays a rich voice . she displays an agile voice and the ability to hit the high notes . her rendition of `` come per sereno '' is spirited . gounod , faust . `` the jewel song . '' very smooth singing ; animated singing . but the technique does not measure up to anna moffo 's version -- let alone joan sutherland 's . puccini , la boheme . `` musetta 's waltz . '' yikes ! what a version . brava netrebko . her darker voice is very well suited to this . the characterization of musetta seems on the mark . a wonderful cut . all in all , this shows the promise of netrebko . it also indicates where her strengths are and where she does not do so well ( coloratura work ) . however , this is a very nice introduction to her work and her art .
waiting to exhale is a great movie , all star cast . i is a movie , that draws you in and will leave you feeling good for the charaters and the story at the end
this volume of mai hime is definitely my favorite so far . there 's tons of action , some really nice plot twists and drama to go along with it . i wo n't give out any spoilers but if you have been watching mai hime and have been a bit bored or hesitant to continue watching this set of episodes really comes through on what we 've all been waiting for . my only gripe is that it has taken the series this long to reach its potential but i 'm glad i stuck with it
i 'm new at reading about energy healing modalities , so i have little to compare it to . i found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about healing touch and how to be a practitioner . it has some wonderful stories , some that even made me cry . i still have a long way to go to make this work for me , but it 's the beginning of a new awareness in my life
no words can express my great appreciation with the band ... starting from imperium until thier rendition of davidian and block , wow .... this is a true definition of headbang . since i bought thier first album burn my eyes and the more things change ... i already know that this band is a straight up heavy metaller 's .... anyway , just watch thier interviews and find out how hard it is to be in a heavy metal band . it is much better if they released it in dts format , but anyway .. ten ton hammer and the blood , the sweat , the tears is present in their setlist ... so what more can you ask for .... order it here in amazon .... no
considering when this musical was made , it is a great forerunner to the later broadway melody films . it is far superior to the remake with lana turner and joan blondell . in my opinion broadway melody of <NUM> was the best broadway melody made . you ca n't really take anything away from broadway melody of <NUM> , in as much as it presented itself with a lot of vigor , good cast and music which for its day surely had movie goers wondering when other musicals were coming . if you are a movie musical buff be sure to include broadway melody of <NUM> in your collection
i thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting , with a budget probably no bigger than an average jackie chan movie . the ending was novel and jet li & # <NUM> ; s use of needles , to supplement his martial arts skills , added a fresh touch . jet li looks convincing , with respect to his characterisation . and bridget fonda looks good too .
i saw this movie first as well as reincarnation and i got ta say , stop hate'n on it cause of the budget ! this is the best low budget flick ive seen so far with good f/x for the money they had to spend . it has a good plot if you listen and watch carefully so dont hate on the movie because of the production
i picked up this book to find out a bit more about this branch of christianity , and by and large i was not disappointed . this is an eminently readable introduction to anglicanism , from its founding in the 16th century to the present day . it covers all the major developments , and gives a brief background for each . it is particularly useful for anyone who wishes to put the present controversies shaking the anglican communion in a historical context , and the last chapter of the book is devoted to these controversies . the only shortcoming of the book is its overly historical and political point of view . i would have appreciated a more extensive insight into the anglican theology . overall , however , this is a wonderful little book and i highly recommend it .
probably the best album of the last five years , alot more foccussed sounding than `` life on other planets '' and miles better than anything else thats around at the moment .
i like john 's style in writing this book . when i started studying manifolds , i had little understanding of some of the deep concepts of topology . this book was an excellent introduction . what is so cool about this book are the exercises , and they are all connected with each other . it makes a sumptuous meal . the other book on smooth manifolds is definitely on its way to being a classic among beginners
my dad bought me this wonderful little book when i was young , & i have always loved the truly off-center humor of it . in response to the query about the meaning of epiplectic , i found a quick online search produced the same type of results as reviewer rhs got -- mostly references to epileptic & apoplectic . oddly , i have a clear memory of looking it up decades ago ( one of my father 's favorite admonitions was `` look it up ! '' ) and finding a definition that related it to apoplectic , and described it as referring to something that suddenly and somewhat violently falls to pieces . in fact i have often cited 'epiplectic ' as an apt description when watching the blues brothers ' faithful retired police car burst into bits once they make daley plaza , lol -- so this definition , though unconfirmable at the moment , has been clearly emblazoned in my memory for these many years ( right or not ) ! now if i could just find that dictionary of my dad 's to confirm ..
i do n't do a lot of reading for fun . but this book i could n't put down once i started it . it did n't take long for me to be drawn into the story and i could almost taste , see , and experience with the chracters . i vividly experienced this book . that does n't happen to me often . the quiet american is a powerful work . i recommend this book especially to those people who like me do n't read much fiction . i wrote a longer review on bn.com if you want to read a more detailed review that i wrote .
i do n't write reviews , and i do n't purhase movies but i 'm doing both for this one . what a great movie . in a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor , this movie is smart , fast , clever and unexpectedly expected . enough said . rent or buy this movie . watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again . get a kleenex because you 'll laugh so hard you 'll cry .
i became a doors fan way back when they released their first album . forty years later most of their music still bends my ear . this elaborate box set is worth seeking out , especially given the limited numbers available . i read some reviews about the cd remixes that were disappointing . well , folks , they were wrong . and if that 's all you 're looking for they are being released as single cds in the very near future . i wanted this for the dts dvd audio discs that bring this set to twelve discs . nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on . the dts surround sound is nothing less than stunning . from strange days through la woman , the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way . the remixes only enhance my favorites . and this begs my next plea : i have this set , i have talking heads dual disc brick , and pet sounds , and the beatles love , and lyle lovett 's joshua judges ruth , richard thompson , etc. , all in 5.1 surround and/or dts . i would really enjoy the beatles catalogue in dts , as well as most of joni mitchell 's catalogue . and michael jackson , dwight yoakam , steely dan , tom waits , and any other artist whose music is marked by originality and impeccable recordings . the success of perception should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this . all you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading ? not us ! give us what we want , ( and these are n't downloadable ) ! win win ! sony dropped the ball bigtime with sacd , do n't let us down like they did !

a great story based on a real tale of one canadian/afghan womens journey back to afghanistan to search for her frined , who is depressed and contemplating suicide due to the opression and devastation all around . in the movie the friend is actually her sister . the main character relives her actual travels and shows you many things in afghanistan that contribute to the situation her friend is facing , such as hunger , death , robbery , oppression of women and their basic rights , religious fanaticism , etc ... although she is not able to reach her destination of kandahar , either in real life or in the movie , the movie will show you the devastation the afghan people face day to day , and the lengths people go to survive . there are some comical moments , and some real heartfelt moments throughout . one of the best films made about afghanistan , and a true story to boot . directed by the great mohsen makhmalfbaf , if you buy this please view the commentary by the women in the film , it contains great info as to what the situation was like making the film , and her own personal story . also , the dvd contains a special news braodcast about her life , in canada and afghanistan
this is some of reba 's best material , and there is n't a bad song on this cd . some of the best songs on here are , `` you lie '' , rumor has it '' , `` is there life out there '' , `` fancy '' , `` does he love you '' , and `` walk on '' . all of these songs except for `` fancy '' were # <NUM> hits . the only downside to this album is that it is missing lots of songs that were either no . 1s or top tens . all in all this is a good album and i would recommend it to reba fans
