i was just speechless when i first heard this . what was known as the best heavy metal band on earth <NUM> years prior , has become a lion without balls or teeth . country-influenced tunes ! ? slow , blues-influenced songs ? no way , no thanks . also a very overrated album . the black album was okay but <NUM> stars in my book .. but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for metallica.ps : the memory remains and unforgiven <NUM> are horrible songs .
right lets make this very clear there are only <NUM> good issues out of the nine here ... the actual x men issues with art by jim lee and scott williams are essential ... claremonts words and lees pencils have always been a good combo ... the fight scenes are dramatic and exciting and everythings ... well ... everythings just right however the other <NUM> coming from new mutants and x factor are crap ... the arts rubbish and especially by the last <NUM> chapters you just want it to end ... seriously it just drags on ... they lose their powers get em back ... still they get beat down . dont know about you but i dont particularly enjoy watching the x men lose fight after fight after fight ( which they seemed to do a lot of in the late 80s early 90s ) unfortuantely its quite an essential story as it brings all the x men back together after a few years apart buy it for jim lee and try to stomach the other stories
based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here , i decided to give this book a try , especially since it 's two books for the price of one . but when i opened up the book , i discovered that you do n't even get mackay 's complete book ; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing . because i was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing i thought i would make do . however there was very little of that to be found , and when it was found , it was typically written in verbose , archaic english , sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the <NUM> 's . there are a couple good gems , but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language . e.g . the money game by adam smith or market wizards , or mindtraps by barach or any of tony oz 's books . there are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time
amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms ' music . with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius ' . the choice of music is also quite perfunctory . there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose . buy at your own risk . my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd ..
hurrah for `` sustainability '' and `` biodiversity '' ! down with the human race
i like most of ac/dc 's music , but i ca n't stand their latest album stiff upper lip . stiff upper lip is the only ac/dc album where you can play it all the way through , and not even hear one good song . stiff upper lip does n't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell . every song on it just bugs the heck out of me . listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience ; but enduring all <NUM> of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy ! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black . but ... those cds had variety , they were semi original , and they were actually pretty good . this cd is just completely worthless . i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime , but none of them were more pain to listen to than this . the vocalist sounds about <NUM> times worse than he did on their earlier albums , the music is chunky , repetitive , dull , and boring , and most of the songs sound the same . stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band . the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for <NUM> minutes than <NUM> separate tracks . this cd is just unbelievaby terrible . it is a disgrace to this band 's legacy , and the band members should be embarrased by it . oh well , i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract , so i guess they do n't care about how awful it is anyway . all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible . it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to . go buy a good ac/dc cd like let there be rock , high voltage , powerage , highway to hell , or back in black . stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise . it 's so awful i 'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this !
high hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release , and i have to admit i am sadly dissapointed . the transfer is only a 'fraction ' above watching a sd dvd version upscaled , which is a real shame . buy at your own risk , or wait for a much better release , hopefully director 's cut , remastered and all . 2.5/5 for effort . -zallap
with a <NUM> copyright , one might expect this manual to be a bit outdated . it 's unfortunate , because otherwise , it 's an excellent reference at a very inexpensive price . the section on electronic sources does n't adequately deal with the proliferation of electronic databases , websites , and other new media . you 'd be better off using one of the many free online mla formatting pages available on university websites .
this is a fine example of a respected intellectual lining up in defense of a difficult-to-justify war and coming out quite convincing . of course , to come out quite convincing , hanson has to resort to some classic and tired old tricks like attacking the protesters of the ( then-upcoming gulf war ii ) , questioning the patriotism of people who dare to question authority , questioning europe ( they ca n't possibly understand us , he writes , even though we basically came from them ) , and other howlers . there are some points here , and some moments where hanson shows that he may be approaching sense . this is an educated , intelligent man . he has notable insights into immigration , and multi-cultural societies , with california ( or mexifornia ) as an example of multi-cultural change . he 's very well rounded , and he 's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual . but too often , i found him repeating what i hear on cable tv , the same old lines , the same old tired arguments about the war on terror . he loves the anti-american argument . he thinks people 'do n't get it ' , when they complain about the usa but meanwhile want to act and be like americans . there are some points to be made here , but too often i found hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about american greatness and international cluelessness . i like how he throws out lines like `` second , the europeans also do n't have a clue about america 's world role -- past , present , or future . '' huh ? i take this to mean that they a ) actually do n't know any history , or b ) do n't 'get ' our role in history from the american point of view , meaning unconditional support for the world 's superpower . it 's funny , of course , considering we as a culture filtered down from europe . he settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it ' attitude , with the classic , 'why do so many people flock to america ? ' i do n't think they flock here because they do n't like our policy in iraq , i think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here . hanson is either clueless , as is a president who can ask with a straight face , 'why do they hate us ? ' or he simply knows the answer but ... it 's funny , and sad , really , that hanson , and millions of others still do n't seem to 'get it ' -- namely , that there may actually be a separation between the people , the culture , and values of a country ( america ) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home . i guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-american ' . by the time you finish the book , if you can , you might wonder whether hanson himself believes what he 's writing , or if he 's an outright cynic . i guess it does n't really matter in the end , since if he 's a good enough writer , then the effect will be the same . you may agree with much of what he writes , but on the war on terror , on bush 's pipe dream of bringing democracy to the middle east , well , he 's either buying it ( with a wink and nudge ) , or he 's honestly hopeful
this sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential nuggets collections -- nuggets : original artyfacts from the first psychedelic era , 1965-1968 ; or nuggets ii : original artyfacts from the british empire and beyond . those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as harry smith 's folk collection . not so here . i counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent , but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties ? not much
i really think snoop is a good rapper . he should only have stopped <NUM> years ago . i 'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff , and i do n't like none of the beats here . and what 's left then ? nothing . i found out after i bought this album : i 'm not a snoop fan anymore ... old school is the bes
i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it 's age and it really gets the history wrong . part of the problem is that other than robert shaw 's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost . the locations used do n't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly . see battleground for a better take on this battle
another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim ... and we wonder why our community has so many problems .. maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films ... '' color purple '' , `` for colored girls .... '' etc . we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we `` work together '' ... that means blackmen and blackwomen ..
a solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors . both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best . if you are averse to dubbing of fictional films , you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous . clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles . but in the age of dvd it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film .
i was very dissapointed in this release , especially compared to their past efforts . not a single song stood out on this , nothing different than the <NUM> other power metal carbon copy bands out there . if you 're a fan of `` glory to the brave '' , `` legacy of kings '' or even the `` renagade '' album just end it there , this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band .
i actually read this entire book just to see if/how beatrice would get what was coming to her . yes , the book is about incest . the ads and cover i 've seen for this book state something like `` murder , incest , betrayal '' or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest . the thing i did n't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex . sex scene after sex scene . i frankly belive it 's better to leave it to the imagination . we all know what happens when you have sex . but really it seemed more wrong that beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love . it was n't just the incest that was gross . gregory 's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times . after everything , i think what beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts i 've ever read . this book was at the most okay and i do not recommend it
bought this book as package recommended by amazon . it is not for adobe photoshop album 2.0 . many changes have been made to album 2.0 and this book has many inconsistencies not usable in the new program . i highly recommend michael slater 's book on album 2.0-it is up to date and useful . i returned this book today
frank oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products . unfortunately , he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk , an alternative that is even riskier . soymilk was rarely drunk in asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern , nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress , thyroid damage , cognitive decline , add/adhd , immune system breakdown , infertility , reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer . sadly , many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk . children are at such risk that in july <NUM> the israeli health ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week . for people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy , i highly recommend ron schmid 's `` the untold story of milk ''
first of all - even though most of my friends hate them - i must admit that i do enjoy watching some good horror flicks . my dvd collection is also primarily concentrating on this genre . besides classics , such as `` psycho '' , `` the haunting ( original ) '' , `` rosemary 's baby '' , `` the exorcist '' , `` the omen ( original ) '' , `` the shining '' , `` the changeling '' , `` halloween '' , `` alien '' and `` the evil dead '' . i also enjoy more recent flicks , such as `` the 6th sense '' , `` the others '' , `` the ring ( us version ) '' , `` the grudge ( us version ) '' `` the descent '' , `` dawn of the dead ( remake ) '' and `` tcm <NUM> remake '' . the problem with `` the beginning '' is , that a. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts . which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie ! b . nobody gets to know why leatherface turned out this way . damn , they could 've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in `` house of wax '' . c. there is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense . these facts , especially the last , make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as `` wolf creek '' , `` high tension '' , `` hostel '' and `` saw ( sequels ) '' . as one re-viewer stated . horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares . this movie sadly could n't succeed , due to unnecessary gore , splatter and blood . i do n't need that
this film is about a female student at randolph university in alabama in the early <NUM> 's who is a writer for the school newspaper . she gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement . it could have been a decent movie , but i found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing . a much , much better movie on this theme is the long walk home and also the ghosts of mississippi
i was pretty disappointed by this . i was looking for songs that my kids could sing and dance to . this just was not it ! ! it 's too bad , its one of my daughter 's favorite movies .
i purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew . when it arrived , i opened the book to the middle and i could not believe what i was looking at . one of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated . blood is spewing from the headless neck , his necklace is falling in one direction , and his separated head ( with a horror/surprise look on his face ) is falling to the ground behind the horse . this is very gruesome , and there is no way i could give this as a gift a child of any age . wondering what could be worse , i turned the page to find another battle scene . one man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow . i am not making this up , the head is split open and details are painted . many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos . i look at the next artwork , and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife . why would someone pick these art works ? why would the editors allow them ? i 'm still stunned that this would make it print .
the only thing that can account for the acclaim that some have lavished on this album is mass hypnosis . signor bocelli 's publicists have declared that he has 'the most beautiful voice in the world ' and people believe it . i agree with the reviewer who described listening to this cd as painful . everything sounds the same -- -like sandpaper . if he were not adorable and blind , this fellow would not have a career even as a pop artist , never mind opera singer . if you want to hear what opera sounds like at its best and most real today , check out ramon vargas , juan diego florez , rolando villazon , marcello giordani and discover the difference between creme brulee and instant pudding
i bought this book because i saw it in the bargain bin at wh smith for 99p . i hate a lot of things , i hate stamps , i hate fanboys , i even hate fanboys who collect stamps ! but none of those can compare to the hatred i have for this book and my curiosity to read it ! i honestly do n't know where to start ; there are certain facts which he has tried to work his way around or completely dodge . for instance , the videogame killer7 , he claims it has a full blown on sex scene , however i have played this and there is nothing over pg rated ! he also mentions criticising the esrb without offering any proof for what he says ! the same could be said for grammar and spelling , it was completely atrocious , it is unforgivable that he is a lawyer and i believe a <NUM> year old could do better ! what i found worse about him is the fact he gives out false threats , he threatened rockstar games to pull their gta games from the shelves or he would bring a law suit to them ... nothing happened ! the last thing i would like to say about the book is he leaves out the negative things about him such as offering to donate $ 10,000 to charity if someone were to make a game of a father killing video game designers . about two or three of these games appeared on the internet and he refused to help charities . in the long run , i believe that the perception of jack thompson has gone bad to worse after releasing this book . a very poor and very sloppy read . save your money , as for my copy ? [ ...
ok , buenos aires is a spanish speaking city ; but when every other word of a sentence in this book is full of spanish , it makes the book very very hard to read ! ! ! ! `` facts about buenos aires '' is nothing but that , a list of useless facts emblished with unnecessary adjatives : `` ... something that differentiates buenos aires ' people from their north american or european cousins - a striving melancholy and a desire for something greater . '' hm ? ? ? what we travelers want is an easy to read book , not a trash compactor , too much information one after another in a paragraph with vague english + foreign words is a waste . the few pictures in this book do n't do justice to the city , take a look at any `` paris '' book out there , your response is usually `` wow , i would like to go there . '' after reading this book , it 's like `` hm ... why do i want to go there ? '' choose a different book ; do n't waste your time and money
let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . <NUM> . it is incredibly beautiful animation <NUM> . the music is amazing <NUM> . i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : <NUM> . the characters are not developed at all <NUM> . you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread <NUM> . it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a <NUM> out of <NUM> , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there was n't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series
we are reading this book for our book group . i 'm not sure if it made me uncomfortable because the perspective was so accurate or if it was because it never went beyond the stereotypes that i already have . i did n't like one character in the book . even the dogs and the kid were annoying . while that may have been the result of good writing , the end product was that i was left feeling nothing but `` ick . '' the characters seemed one dimensional even though a large amount of time was spent detailing their thoughts and opinions . i never understood the `` why 's '' behind any of their actions , just their histories . perhaps i was too slow to draw the conclusion . i felt like a big , over consumerized , ungrateful loser . if that 's your thing , you may love the book .
long-time waits fan here , with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list . i owned this album for nearly a year , before i traded it in . it took me a while to figure out why i always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it -- because it s -- ks . the lyrics either are incoherent , just strung together ( eg get behind mule ) , or veer off into the cringingly sentimental ( eg house where nobody lives , chocolate jesus ) . the music mostly drags , when it 's not downright grating . he 's lost it . you ca n't blame him for not knowing it , i guess . but it 's long past time to write him off -- since bone machine . ( the stage works black rider , alice , and blood money , show a consistent weakness -- a lack of focus lyically as well as musically , not to mention a lot of low fi recording . i had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why i kept skipping tracks on black rider -- because it mostly su-ks -- and treaded it . ) he peaked with the island trilogy . my personaly favorite is frank 's wild years . before the far-out sound , he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick . now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling . and his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life . is there any chance of a renascence ? ( not as yet based on a sampling of real gone . ) all the kids who have caught onto the waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on rain dogs and swordfishtrombones . back then even when the references and language were oblique , or obscure , they developed a story or an image or a sentiment . it built from line to line -- developed an idea , with continuity . now it 's mostly a string of stylized cr-p , using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end .
do ben clark 's teenage fans realize that he 's pushing thirty ? the dude is old . he 's not a young jackass , he 's an old jackass . and is n't it a bit creepy that an old dude like ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds ? check out the lashes myspace profile . creeeeepy !
we did not receive this item . we would rather not rate this item since it was never received ... we consider it a zero star not even <NUM> star
we went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick , much less anyting with jamie lee curtis . it came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it . whether the movies promised to be good or bad , we went and had fun with them either way . this one we had fun in how bad it was . this was one of those , `` picked on , pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank , only to come back with genius killer skills , somehow attained super strength and the speed of the road runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play . '' in short , there 's nothing to be believed in this stinker . like a `` friday the 13th '' flick , you merely wait for the kills , and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends , and pray for that to come as soon as possible . the movie pulls out the stops , giving us curtis for eye candy and david copperfield to amaze us , perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect . but in general , this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a `` halloween '' type thriller . there 's too much stupidity from the victims , oh , until one genius finally puts <NUM> and <NUM> together . there 's too much `` not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison . '' and given her presence , there 's just not enough jamie lee to make this crock worth sitting through . we had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre . it made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse , more predictable , and far too numerous to maintain our interest . this movie got that ball rolling . do n't waste your time . you 'll get more excitement out of watching jamie lee 's finger nails dry for a couple hours
this book was awful . the author is a bad writer in general . also , as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book , she is not recovered . this means that she can not distance herself from her disorders and therefore ca n't really write about them well . there is a tinge of smugness in her account , like , `` look how thin i am , i just ca n't eat . '' it 's boring and it 's about a really lame person ... she is incapable of living her life at all . she still lived with her parents for the majority of her life
i consider myself a huge pixar fan . this is easily the most insipid pixar movie ever . pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one . i have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie . pixar , if you are listening , please , please , dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff . i expect more from you
some of this book is good and normally i love suzanne summers but .... a few comments like `` no wonder men leave us for younger woman '' . like what is that about ? woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy . does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging ? when i ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off . woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first . i just felt the book was a push for the s principle book and to be hot for your guy . usually her stuff is good but i was n't crazy about this one . sorry nothing new in this book . maybe helpful to someone else . jud
this movie is very bad , and i mean horrible . vin diesel can not act ! what the heck was he thinking ? ! walt disney must be twisting in his grave ! ! i will never see this film ever again . the rest of the cast is disgusting , stupid , and terrible . they get dumber in every part of the movie , and a baby cries through a couple of parts of the film ... and it gets very annoying . if walt disney were alive , he 'd yell at vin diesel , and all the actors in this movie . and the final thing , this is not `` comedy '' at all .
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives , it portrays reality how they want to see it . its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it . entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
constantine maroulis may be easy on the eyes , but thei s cd is awful . a bit to hardcore for a debut albumn . maybe payback for not getting further in ai , i really think he can sing and does have talent , when he did david cassidy 's i think i love you , it was a good take on a old <NUM> 's song . then when he did queens bohmeian rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones , ( no freddy ) but not bad . sorry this is just a disappointment , better luck next cd . this may have been a let down to his fans , not to mention that ai has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd , for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it
the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of `` classic '' . i assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs .. a large portion of the cd i can not see it as a gothic `` club '' material esspecially throwing in some type-o .. i been through alot of clubs and i can not find a way to hit that song in the dance floor .. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places .. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would i was very dissapointed in the whole cd . listened to a few songs here and there , if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you .. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past .
this is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book . this book , in my opinion , is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders . a complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance . take time researching this book before you buy it because it 's the worst book i 've ever purchased .
i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album , and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse . ive seen sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound . this album is more pop . if it ai n't broke do n't fix it
if you want to consult the first folio , get a facsimile . freeman 's `` editions '' are not only pointless , they are profoundly misleading : only someone who was completely ignorant about jacobean book-production could possibly suppose that the vagaries of f1 represent a meticulous adherence to shakespeare 's intentions . in the matter of lineation , for example , charlton hinman long ago showed that compositors would divide their copy into lines to suit their own convenience -- i.e . to take up more or less space as the process of `` casting off '' required
i like sam elliott movies very much . this one was bad ! ! ! a lot of bad language . every couple of words . it should be rated r. i think instead of pg
it was the sixties , and anyone with long hair and a shambling , preoccupied air of sensitivity could get money to make a movie . that 's how michael sarne , director of this colossally misguided effort , was able to get the job . sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie . in fact , the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called joanna . that film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif genevieve waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter . sarne , who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget hollywood film , was in way over his head . if the film looks horribly amateurish , that 's because it is . if there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era , myra breckinridge provides that marker . it embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic . breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein : the debasement of culture . watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years . many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other , older ( and better ) films . some actually liked these clunky `` comments '' on what was taking place in the movie , others found them pointless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself , any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief . in my opinion , the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility , but a paucity of invention , the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed . that is to say , sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time . they were n't inspiration , they were desperation . his writing skills were virtually nonexistent , and screenwriter david giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so sarne was left to try and make a movie , and he could n't . it was beyond his slim capabilities . hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips . the ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because sarne sure as heck was n't able to . this was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and ` thought ' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew ( not to mention the studio brass , the producers , and the accountants ) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of zeus . um , oops . no zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window . bye-bye , baby , bye-bye . as for myself , i hated the film clips . they denigrated sarne 's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality , and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them . the film was doomed the day he was hired , and a very funny and original book by gore vidal became the jerky , manic , and supremely unfunny ( except when it was n't trying to be ) myra breckinridge , the meltdown .
i was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine , for a topic at the university . she came to the classroom with this book , as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching . first of all , i thought it 's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom . secondly , the things the authors wrote are so obvious , at least for some persons , that all i can say is that i really had a very good time reading it as a comic book , nothing else . i laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a <NUM> or <NUM> year-old pupil , because he touched her on the arm . it was a lecture , not a simple explanation ! clearly we have to be polite , encouraging and nice towards the students . but this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way , that i could only laugh . i never had problems with students in my classes , i always tried to encourage them to like the subjects ; i am sure they learned many things , as well as i learned from them , too . this book was just a waste of time . the worst thing is that the teacher i am talking about , the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is , does n't practice what the book preaches ! she is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to . how is it possible ? she did n't learn anything from it ? ? ? maybe it 's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then i would say read it , but even though i would be very cautious . but being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states , i could imagine it would n't really be that good .
we are traveling the us for almost a year and have purchased the east as well as the west edition before we started . besides the fact , that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far , our comments are as follows : <NUM> . the contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do simply not exist any more for years ! ! <NUM> . the directions are awful if not wrong <NUM> . we spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved not to mention the hazzle , driving around in circles <NUM> . lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are as wrong as they are in those <NUM> . campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers ( icons ) are not part of the book anymore <NUM> . the icons in the maps are close to impossible to read ( use a magnifier ) overall we can absolutely not recommend those books to anybody
i 'm sorry , but i expect more out of a book . beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric . after reading beautiful books such as cold mountain and brideshead revisited , to mention just two , i found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that i knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that would n't be worth the read . at page four i was fed up with the author 's style and slammed the book shut
bravo mgm ; you 've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible dvd . -it 's actually an orion picture , and i 'd hoped that they would 've cared more about its appearance , but no such luck . of my 100+ dvds , this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image . ( let 's hope they 're more careful with their upcoming woody allen orion collection . ) this is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just do n't make them anymore in hollywood , but it 's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on tv . hackman , heard , cassidy and jones lead a good cast , but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie . until then , avoid like the plague
i was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when i told him that that i was starting a bookstore . i learned maybe , oh , <NUM> or <NUM> things that were slightly important . i especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time , and how mired in the past this book is ( even with it 's new chapter on the internet ) . in any business , there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current . for the young bucks starting in the industry , do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages : amazon.com ( most useful ) , and abe.com . getting a part time job doing grunt work ( shelving , cleaning ) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will .
well , unless you are a hardcore collector like myself ( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago ) , stay clear of this album . if you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself , then forget this album & make your own noise . the best track on the album is the bonus track . that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music . i give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ; - ) . search judemac forever '' on msn
it ' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music . in some cases the music go to the hand with the story , but not in this cd , in which we say the music that it is not for the story . i did n't ejoyed with that c
i predicted in <NUM> that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan would n't stand the test of time . it was all the rage in <NUM> and i still ca n't honestly tell why . with its painful -- - and i mean painful -- - bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy , it seems to be little more than someone 's `` artsy '' home movie . i agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive , self-obsessed , women-children .... that was big in the 1990s but i think it 's changing . ( in fairness to the film , i can also appreciate that go fish was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry . ) what makes this film ultimately fail , in my opinion , ( aside from the acting ) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young , urban lesbian ghetto . almost all of the characters ' issues , views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny , specific demographic . there are a few crossover fans out there , but i ca n't imagine too many midwestern , middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate . as a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out : `` why would i want to go see some grainy , black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives do n't remotely resemble my own ? '' the normal answer to that question , of course , is : because it 's an interesting story with compelling characters . however , in the case of go fish , neither applies . there 's not much of a story and frankly , you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it . watching this film is like seeing someone 's <NUM> year-old home movies -- - bad cinema , bad entertainment .
first , my background : i am not a mathematician , but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials . i do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians . this book is obviously a work of great effort by the author . my difficulty probably came from the work 's ambitious premise : offering mathematical and biographical history of hilbert 's problems . there are simply too many ideas and persons ( some well known , others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself ) to cover in one book . the author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources . my impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers , and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages . the result : the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem , some necessary ideas introduced , who the major solvers were , then a short biography of each solver , when and where they were born , who their parents were , where they went to school , who they married and so on ; then another cycle begins . halfway into the book , i began to get bored . i can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes , but lay readers much beware . i recommend lay readers to check out a few pages carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it . i certainly did n't hate it but did not like it as much as i expected
the sound of the water rushing over rocks on this cd is very relaxing . the only problem is it also has the sound of birds chirping which is very annoying . i did not hear these birds chirping when i first played the sound sample on amazon.com . so if you are thinking about buying the cd for the sound of water alone , you may want to look at a different cd
i did n't read the book ; i purchased it based on the actors , that was a huge mistake . had i paid attention to the people who rated this with one star i could have spared myself the anguish of watching it . i have <NUM> movies with bruce willis in them and its goes without saying i now have <NUM> this went in the trash . i would n't think of even giving it away for fear someone found out i actually paid money for this garbage . i have a collection pushing <NUM> dvds and this is the first time i have had to write a negative review
it is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach . the movie does give you a conclusion for the anime . there is little to laugh at in this movie , the directors are to focused on making their point . they have decided to make the anime and movie more `` real '' than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be `` realistic '' have created inconsistancies that can not be explained . the music and animation are excellent . but i would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie
roland joffe directed two masterpieces : the killing fields & the mission . but those two films , directed in <NUM> & <NUM> , were made twenty or more years ago . i 'd recommend either of those two films to anybody but vatel i would recommend only to those viewers who can enjoy a film for its look , its set design and its attention to period detail even when the story and characters themselves are not all that captivating . vatel is a film that should have everything going for it . as mentioned the director has at least two masterpieces to his credit , tom stoppard had a hand in the screenplay ( more on that in a minute ) , uma thurman is beautiful , and gerard depardieu & julian sands & tim roth are each capable of delivering memorable performances when they feel inspired . the problem is no one feels inspired by this material . and that is in part due to a lackluster set of characters -- supposedly based on actual people -- and a story that never really manages to capture our imagination . gerard depardieu as master steward `` vatel '' is required by his boss , the gout-stricken prince conde aka general conde , to arrange elaborate feasts and entertainments for a visiting retinue of royals that include king louis xiv , his mistresses , his brother , and various advisors & handlers . if these feasts and entertainments succeed in capturing the kings fancy then vatel 's boss may receive the honor of commanding the french troops in a war with holland ( that may or may not happen ) . so virtually every frame of the film is dedicated to following vatel as he personally oversees virtually every dish and set decoration before it is presented to the royal retinue . as viewers we are amazed by vatel 's ingenuity with everything from outdoor theatrical sets that resemble large fold-out books to his ability to make delicate lanterns out of vegetable gourds ( martha stewart would be impressed ) but our interest is purely aesthetic because we never really care whether the prince gets his royal comission or not and we barely care about vatel . next to the selfish , scheming and utterly corrupt royals the selfless and earthy and incorruptible vatel seems , well , selfless and earthy and incorruptible . along with his many domestic and artistic talents vatel also has an uncanny way of understanding people 's true natures and needs better than they . the problem with vatel is that he is perhaps too selfless and so while he busies himself with entertaining others his own life is virtually a non-event . uma thurman plays a woman of precarious social standing . she is from a noble family but her position at court is not yet secure and like everyone else she must humor the king to assure his continued favor . when he suggests that they meet in private `` for a cup of chocolate '' she has no choice but to agree . she is under no illusion that she is anything but a temporary amusement for the king but to refuse the king 's advances would be social suicide . the royal world sickens her and we are supposed to see her as somehow too earthy and real for court life but one problem is that this character is barely there . uma just barely goes through the motions when she is onscreen ; instead of seeming like she is dissatisfied with court life she just looks like she is dissatisfied with having to be in this royal dud of a picture . this is too bad because she is supposed to be the muse that awakens or re-awakens vatel 's long dormant passions but there is absolutely zero spark between uma thurman and gerard depardieu . when the obese fifty-something depardieu kisses the thirty-something uma we just do n't get it . few screen romances have ever felt so unconvincing and so void of passion and so uncomfortable to watch . we do know that depardieu as vatel is capable of feeling affection because he is very fond of his pet parrots but alas none of this affection is apparent when uma thurman is in frame . we 're supposed to feel that its the rabid social competition of court life that reduces love to a mere game of conquest and that true love in such a world does n't have a chance . instead what we feel is that lack of chemistry between actors is what kills passion . since the depardieu-thurman romance does n't manage to throw off even one spark the primary story-line is d.o.a . . the elaborate theatrical productions and fireworks displays might hold your attention for a few minutes but this film is not interesting enough to hold your attention for two hours . julian sands does a pretty good job as king louis xiv and tim roth an ok job as one of the kings advisors but neither of these actors are given anything very interesting to do or say . though tom stoppard 's name appears in the credits when you look closer you realize that tom stoppard did n't write an original screenplay rather he merely adapted a french text . thus even though this film tries to ride on the coat tails of the stoppard penned shakespeare in love this production does not have any of stoppard 's signature cleverness or wit .
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series . years later i read s is for silence and was hooked . i started to read the series -- backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning . i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh <NUM> lbs on her <NUM> ' <NUM> '' frame ) . however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best . you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions -- -belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few . the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics . but even with these issues , i did finish the book . grafton at her low point is still a good read
jill sobule really hit it big with her first hit & quot ; i kissed a girl & quot ; , which is on her second self-titled album & quot ; jill sobule & quot ; . this first album is n't really all that good ; like she was still finding herself . for a better album , check out her & quot ; jill sobule & quot ; album or even better & quot ; happy town & quot ;

well , my wife and i tried this diet plan , and lost a little , but ... con : some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy . con : it makes no mention of what to do if you 're lactose intolerant . con : how do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch ? arrowroot ? pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores . file gumbo ? makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal . con : somewhat poorly written , more poorly compiled into a book , and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated ( back to school with you now ! ) in compiling a comprehensive index . facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book . pro : she 's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of atkins , sugar-busters , and carb addicts . pro : she 's easier on the eyes than atkins was
this is the best starting book for anyone who wants to delve into hypnosis . but it is often available as used book only and is the first in a 4-vol set . but soon ( sometime in early <NUM> ) , there will be a 8-vol ( yes , <NUM> books in a set ) set in a single cd that also comes with audio and bonus video and at $ <NUM> ! back about this book ... it tells you experiments and findings of tests conducted on hypnotized subjects and how they react to suggestions by the `` hypnotizer '' and also what happens when they are told to do things ( while in trance ) that they would not do in normal consciousness . the sections on trance and suggestions are excellent ; perhaps the best overview of trance and how suggestions work . much of the material is suitable for a hypnotherapist to use in a pre-talk to trance induction
i have been greatly been disappointed in this book . i am a total francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern france , be it travelogue , novel , cultural study , etc . i have been reading map of another town over the past few months and it 's been a struggle . mfk fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things , like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to africa , and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process . she 'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in aix-en-provence and its environs -- it 's a map of her own head , where she spends too much time . she finds herself rather fascinating , but i found her self-centered . i thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s , but again , the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings ( if you can find it , village in the vaucluse , a laurence wylie cultural study first written in <NUM> and updated in <NUM> and <NUM> , is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a french culture course -- <NUM> stars plus. ) . i probably will not even bother with a considerable town and will finish map of another town only because i feel like i should . if you are considering this book because life in southern france fascinates you , i would instead recommend any of the peter mayle books ( not jumping on the bandwagon here ; i 've read his books from the beginning and own all of them , and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing , even when he 's being a snob ) , yvone lenard , etc . in fact , peter mayle 's books so charmingly describe provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer , so you can visualize and plan your own trip . with his writing style , it feels like you 're along for the trip , whereas with mfk fisher , you wonder when you 're going to get there .
i was really excited when i saw this dvd and really deflated when i actually attempted to complete it ! the instructor gives relatively little if any instruction on how to successfully complete moves ; and she switches from combo to combo , move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up . i have also never sweated so much in my life , mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration ! i am in relatively good shape ; i walk up to <NUM> miles a day and wanted this to break the routine . in only broke my spirits ! unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer , stay away ! one of the worst workouts i have ever seen
this text will be a chore to read for most american students who are new to gis . although the author ( s ) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters , the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy , jargon-filled 'proper ' use of british english & amp ; spellings . if you decide to purchase this book , then i highly recommend the 'oxford unabridged english dictionary ' to go along with it . the majority of the students in my class & quot ; geographic information systems i & quot ; at southwest texas state university , which has one of the best geography programs in the nation , felt the same way i do , and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory gis class . i think that the professors at southwest texas state university are now using a different text for that class . also , people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- well , like it or not , in the united states , esri has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn arcview/info one way or another
it is obvious that this movie is full of lies . although i have not actually seen it , i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel ( god bless them ! ) . the way he attacks poor mr. heston is deplorable . ca n't michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he does n't have his faculties about him ? i am also unsure that mr. heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying . the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing , making it appear that my president ( heston ) is an uncaring , babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you michael ! and as for the way he got the gun from the bank , i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they did n't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank . bravo to those who figured that out . also , michael moore is fat . take that pinkie
this movies rates right up there with `` schindler 's list '' . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda . fortunately , ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making `` gettysburg , '' and the even better `` gods and generals . '' if you want to see a real , accurate depiction of the war for southern independence ( aka , the civil war ) , watch `` gods and generals '' or `` gone with the wind , '' and stay away from movie garbage like `` andersonville . '' also watch for the extended version dvd of `` gods and generals '' coming for the christmas season of <NUM> .
i host a karaoke show in nashville . i have never bought disney karaoke cd 's . however , i will offer you one tip . a lot of people are mislead by & quot ; karaoke cd & quot ; . always read on the disc and make sure it says cd+g on it . i bought some chartbuster karaoke cd 's that were on clearance for 2.99 each . i thought i had a deal . it was just that-a cd and not a cd+g ( compact disc + graphics ) . fortunatly , they took them back and refunded my money . karaoke cd 's are usually just background music
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and does n't let go . mercy stands out from all the rest . you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
i liked this book up until the ending . i expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable ( it 's what i thought was going to happen ) , but at least satisfying and believable considering the power grisham gave the cia throughout this entire book . instead , the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me
this guide is written in french and is utterly useless to anyone who does not speak french

with the burden of ideological narration , this documentary does not provide an in depth look at the history . it does not provide a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are manipulated and edited together with an biased flow , without a good balance of academia and historians involved . we can not get the `` facts '' from different points of view . `` goldberg 's film presents a slanted historical account , according to some viewers who wrote into pbs stations and a scholar who participated in the panel discussion . if you only take one side and report their deaths , it seems like genocide . but of course it was n't that , said justin mccarthy , a professor of history at the university of louisville . mccarthy , who acknowledges holding a minority view , believes goldberg 's film takes a selective snapshot of history and fails to address the deaths of many turks at the hands of armenian militants . `` it was an inhuman , bestial time , he said . there were wide-scale , mutual massacres across eastern and other areas of ( the ottoman empire ) a mutual- extermination kind of war . ''
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta . their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie . besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it . as usual , uma 's acting is simply dreadful . i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad . how she became a `` star '' in hollywood is beyond me . she is not attractive nor can she act . she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit . i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles , they call her . john travolta is not much better . his version of `` cool '' just does n't do it for me . his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak . and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so . the only reason i gave this movie <NUM> stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn . their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie . i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping . while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes , i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes ; they were so funny i had to see them again . cedric the entertainer was also pretty good .
i hated this book . this family has two girls , racie and jaynell . rachie is a girly-girl and jaynell is a tomboy . it seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa . her parents are just plain crazy . mama repedily whipped racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to `` tear up '' their hides each time they do something he does not like . once jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar , nearly strangleing her , and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize . then jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on racie . her parents are just crazy . then grandpa dies . dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it . i understand that sparking fear in a child 's eye is a good thing . children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy . racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs . jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful . these people were crazy . this book is crazy
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius , he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro , awesome ! hoffman , awesome ! streisand , awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless , and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie , these a-1 actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film , and i recommend it to every and anyone to see , but wear your depends , because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya <NUM> , you do n't know what in the friggin ' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser , that complains about going out to the movies ? stay home , i 'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
yikes ... way , way way to slick and over produced ... its all just like muzak really . stay clear unless you are really square ..
this little book is , in my opinion , a really poor attempt at humor and a huge disappointment to the wonderful bridget jones diaries . if you have read the bridget jones books , then this little book is unnecessary since it is just regurgitated material from her diaries . however , if you have not read the bridget jones diaries yet , i highly suggest you do that first since this little book might be a turn-off if you do n't know what you are dealing with ahead of time . this book contains silly pictures of how to shove things under your bed before company comes and how to call for domino 's delivery ... ( yes , there are pictures showing the reader how to dial the telephone , but it does n't stop there . we also get photographic details on how to open the box and put the pizza in our mouths ! ) if this kind of information could be useful to you then , by all means , get this book . however , if you are like most of us and already know how to dial a telephone , stick a slice of pizza in your mouth , shove things under your bed and step on a bathroom scale , then i suggest you save your ( money )
whilst i do like jessica and nick , ( i was a fan of jessica since `` i 'm gon na love you forever '' and i always liked 98degrees ) , this is embarrasing . on newlyweds , i think she 's actually funny . i love the show and i do n't see the negatives that people talk about . this however was different . i ca n't beleive they need the money , so jessica and nick - don '' t do this again . i could n't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face . it 's fine to do songs along with other famous singers , but do n't sing with a car , and do n't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times . yes there are some good moments in this , but overall , ? i was cringing considerably
the title of this movie is a tad deceptive- it and the soundtrack are the only thing disco related to this soap opera of a movie that carries a script worthy of a `` sex and the city '' episode . there are some , albeit very few , interesting plot twists . but basically this movie is mostly worthy of a late night movie made by and for cinemax . pity too . i 'm a huge chloe sevigny fan ( and not for `` brown bunny '' reasons ) , but her talent is minimally utilized , as is that of her co-stars . i realize this movie is largely about recent college grads and their pretentious entrance into the real world , with the disco night life as a back drop . but their trials and tribulations have little to do with the disco life itself . `` the club , '' the flick 's disco night life place to be , is merely what central perk was to the tv show friends- a gathering place to gossip about relatively juvenile adventures in love ( or reasonable facsimiles of ) , and their recent and up to now short durations in the working world . the minimal glances into `` the club '' itself is archetypal . were it not for an admittedly clever twist that explains a lot of the behavior of that disco 's employees earlier in the movie , the dialogue would be largely mundane , uninspired and testing of the viewers patience . the pay off is n't rewarding enough to rescue one from that experience . kate beckinsdale 's character is the stereotyical pain in the [ ... ] , nose in her friends ' business nuisance , and she plays that well . but an annoying character does not a good movie make . and for a movie of this title , the dance scenes are minimal in quantity and display . were it not for a friend letting me borrow his copy , i would n't have even dropped a single dollar to rent this flick . to be fair , the soundtrack is outstanding and solely keeps one following the movie 's events . but that 's hardly a reason to waste a couple hours watching this film 's paint dry . you could probably buy the soundtrack and have a more entertaining experience
zero stars , for a product not yet out . ( <NUM> for a great series though ) while a few of the initial reviews , or should i say previews listing episodes , are informative , none of these writings here really do me , or most consumers any good , since this item has not yet been released ! amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing , drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality , the actual episodes released , packaging , possible defects ( like the magnum series & maiden 's last live dvd , both featured defective sections ... ) when the product is released , i will have to wade through <NUM> ( as of oct <NUM> ) b.s . pre-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying ... these pre 's , are presented by : fans ? industry sales schmucks ? amazon employees ? who knows , pre-buyer beware ...
speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life i can honestly say this book did nothing for me . i do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies . however , i do n't think this book gets that message across ! it sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does , failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive . besides that , it 's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive . also , i beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again . close to <NUM> % of people in america are overweight , possibly more . this includes children . we are far bigger than we were <NUM> years ago and ingest far larger portions of food . heart attacks are killing more and more people and it 's victims are getting younger , sometimes even children and people under <NUM> years old . sure , some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority . i do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but i do n't think pushing overweight models would be any better . if you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself , you might like this book . if you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked , this will sound like a really whiny , excuse filled , negitive book . yes , i work out to be healthy . yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how i feel . no , i do n't want to look like a supermodel . i loved my body fat and i love it now , that 's why i lost the weight to begin with . i want to live as long as i can in this body and feel the best i can instead of feeling slow , tired and heavy like i used be . i feel much better , my chronic foot pain went away and i have lots more energy . i work out <NUM> days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too . this book does nothing to help people in the long run , it 's just someone 's angry rant about their warped perspective ! being obese is n't healthy and that 's why people think it looks ugly , it 's not because we are a brainwashed , shallow society ! and no , being fat is not a fate worse than death , it is death and kills millions of people every year !
this book is exactly that . i know mr. morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book ... my father , mel riley . all i can say is , you should read paul smith 's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the stargate and rv stories . there is also a documentary , if you can find it , made be discovery bbc called `` the real x-files '' featuring a true and honest view of rv and it 's history with the military and all those involved . giving this book much more than <NUM> star is really admitting lack of intelligence .
let me tell you , shayne ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks , if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today , face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him . look at justin timberlake , where is he today , they go and move on , and thats what shayne will do except alot faster . this song is so rubbish , the thing i hate so much is that he did n't even write this ! so its not his own material , and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song , its not like these lyrics mean anything to him , as he did not write . and on `` no promises '' thats even worse than this , yes he might of wrote it i do n't know , but does the song have depth , or is it just a plain old expected pop song . by the way it 's the second one . shayne ward has no protential , neather does anyone who comes of x factor , its all just one big [ ...
all `` style '' and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta & uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the `` entertainer '' please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .
if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews , you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good ( not great ) acting . jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent . well not all of the time , since her accent seems to come and go . the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has . skip it unless you really , really , really love jessica lange . by the way , if this movie is set in the early sixties , why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall ? this is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend ! puh-lease
as an eco fan , i could not wait to read his latest novel . sadly , i was deeply disappointed by this pompous , self-indulgent , virtually unreadable monster . the cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something italian librarian .
i just had the chance to watch this film , and i was pretty sickened by the approach the writers took to this material . apparently , someone felt that the classic `` mystery '' approach which the scooby-doo franchise had leaned on for the past several decades had grown stale , and so the writers and producers decided to throw away the formula which had made scooby-doo so popular , and re-cast this storyline into a cliche-ridden horror film more akin to `` night of the living dead '' . the writers go out of their way to mock the previous incarnations of the cartoon , pointing out time and again how all of the `` monsters '' which the scooby-gang had encountered in the past had been men in monster suits . on this outing , the monsters they meet have no tricks . they are real . real zombies , real ghosts , real voodoo priestesses . along with all this so-called 'realism ' are disturbing situations and terror , including graphic depictions of beheadings , torsos being ripped apart , and a scene where a group of peaceful farmers are herded into a crocodile-infested swamp by a bloodthirsty band of pirates , where they are eaten . it 's not shown , but the quick cut away leaves little to the imagination with all the off-screen screaming . in short , this is a serious mis-step in the scooby-doo mythos , with the scooby-gang at first cocky and assured that there are hidden wires or holographic projectors creating the monsters , only to grow more terrified and helpless as it 's revealed that the horrors are not created , but actual . the writer 's attempt to inject some educational value into the proceedings seems to be limited to indentifying the vast amounts of regional food that scooby and shaggy are constantly gorging themselves on . the insinuation that monsters like this are real is subversive and not appropriate for the age group that these cartoons are aimed at . not recommended , unless you 're an older viewer who 's curious about the whole `` what if '' factor involved . the animation and other factors are all good , for this kind of direct-to-video product , and there are some brief moments of winking humor that long-time fans will quickly pick up on
i am a die hard celine fan and i got this cd for my birthday ... i have one word to describe it boring . this is for little babies and their mothers . so i have it because i have it . beautiful boy is a good song though . if you are a die-hard celine fan you might want to get it used of save your money .... luckily i did n't spend a cent on it .
george benson can be one of the best guitar players , make some of the best recordings , and sound so good , if he wanted to . if you think george benson is any kind of jazz , you 'd be right . he even started out playing straight ahead jazz . but by no means , is this a jazz album . many of the songs on here are horrible r & b with vocals , by benson . that 's ok if that 's what you like , but i curtainly dont . we already got enough r & b vocalists . benson is a talented man ! why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage . the only good song on this cd is softly , as in a morning sunrise ; and that 's questionable . no , george benson did not pull it off with his latest effort . benson , you got ta play some jazz . any thing else , but this . lay off the r & b vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are
contrary to the concert of praise surrounding lang 's virtuosity , these memories have little to do with music . is fingerbreaking pace , music ? the scherzo of chopin third sonata says it all : it 's all about how fast lang can play , not at all about what chopin 's music means . the score -written by the decidely stubborn chopin- does n't acknowledge lang 's change of tempo : there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle . once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype , marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats . i 'll take the impetuous argerich over this anytime : at least she is genuine . her scherzo is organic , fluid . a recent cd by pianist svetlana ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as lang is in the sun , she follows chopin 's score in a meaningful and sensitive way . check the soundclip on her website [ ... ] , compare with others on amazon , listen !
i bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with lyme disease . i found it minimally useful . it is relaxing , but i was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one 's body . perhaps it is intended to heal the soul , which may ultimately heal the body , but i was disappointed
overall , this book was terrible . i will start with the few excellent points this book made : many celebrities have horrendous families ( <NUM> kids from <NUM> different men , for example ) , but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women ( ex : `` welfare mothers '' ) . the chapter on welfare mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading . they make the point that parents are too `` child-centered '' now . it is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need . kids do n't really need much of either . however , what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of `` child-centered . '' the marketing of products moms `` need '' is out of control . many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk . you need to be smart about marketing , good point . but ... then .... the authors make a comment like this : `` while it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that america still had no national day care or nursery school system , the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers . '' that 's right , it 's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic ! no matter what the problem , these authors will find someone/something to blame it on . now , to all the other things that i did not like about this book ( where to start ! ) : the authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers . give me a break . women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense . please do n't blame people for making you feel guilty as a mother . celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us . they ca n't even compare their lives to ours . and , if they try , you must know it is a bunch of baloney . if you do n't want to read about celebrity babies , do n't buy people . do n't watch et . it 's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much . although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare ( they vehemently defend daycares , even ones that are investigated for crimes against children ) , they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- andrea yates , susan smith , babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new `` momism . '' this is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children . no matter what your parenting problem , the authors have an excuse for you ! `` dumb men , stupid choices- or why we have no childcare : '' the authors open with a description of a wwii daycare center . the few that were actually like this were open <NUM> hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked , along with meal prep , and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center ( which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty ) . the authors are saying this is what it should be like today ...... so then the authors go on to bash everyone who does n't agree with their childcare position . then they bring out this stat : `` by <NUM> , <NUM> percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents . '' they are implying that <NUM> % of women out there need/want government daycare centers . first of all , that statistic is ridiculous . the <NUM> % stat includes part-time moms ( which are about ¬Ω of the <NUM> % ) . some of these moms work very few hours , other do `` split shifts '' with their spouse so their children do n't have to go to daycare . many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins . i really doubt these kids would rather be in big , govt . daycare . now , of the roughly <NUM> % of moms working full-time , the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small . if you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work , they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt . daycare . they also overwhelmingly , if given a choice , would rather stay home and raise their own children . so , the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system , of enormous cost , that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers . then this comment , `` many young mothers who need a salary-and , frankly , time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs , either for the sake of the kids , or because they simply ca n't afford the childcare near them . '' are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun ? it sure sounds like it ! the authors act like there are no honest women out there who enjoy motherhood . the authors are clearly blinded by their own feelings . i 'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy , fulfilled mothers are a `` myth . '' it 's not . in the chapter : `` dr. laura 's neighborhood '' ( and in the rest of this book ) we learn that if you are a : man , home-schooling mom ( except a few minority who the authors think are ok ) , attachment parenting mom , christian , conservative , someone who likes organically grown food , happy mother , a member of the `` greatest generation , '' someone who likes decorating , pro-life , breastfeeding mom , mother of multiple babies ( they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs ) or a sahm-you are not approved by these authors ! these authors are pompous and arrogant , thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others . these women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them . the women who wrote this book are the type that will sneer at you in traget because your child is crying or having a tantrum . they are the types who would turn the other way and let the door slam in your face when you are trying to get your stroller out an non-automatic door . and watch out if you are on their `` most hated '' list because you would get the extra-extra dirty look . this book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school , written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique .
i am a big fan of `` american me `` `` blood in blood out `` etc . but this one just totally sucked ! ! ! it has really cheesy sound effects and the story is well not as good as i thought . i think you should watch `` scarface `` `` goodfellas '' `` god father `` traffic `` carlitos way `` blow `` <NUM> grams `` training day `` just to same a few
why did they have to produce this album . from start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear . this was a severe disappointment . even more disappointing then eve . at least eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste ' for not so with on air . if you 're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise do n't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd 's out there . i , unfortunately , own the cd and have listened to it many times and i ca n't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album . that is if there are any .
i had this one in high school . i remember loving it . after purchasing it , i realized it was n't as good as i remembered it being . granted , it has brought back quite a few memories , but i do n't really know if they 're really worth remembering . it 's up to you , buy it if you want
never a beach boys fan i had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews . what a dissapointment . i just do n't get it . & quot ; god only knows & quot ; is indeed a masterpiece , but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me . i 've tried multiple listenings to make sure i 'm not missing anything , but the plain truth is that this album stinks . i was expecting some deep music as described by some beach boys fans , but the best use i can get out of this album is using it as a coaster . in a word , boring
this novel highly disappointed me and i 'm a big james patterson fan . the usual short chapters do n't bother me , but this novel was running over with characters ... okay ... so i do n't like too many characters that i have to remember . but i stayed with the book and when it came to the ending , i kept telling myself ... no way . but , it ended the way it ended . i purchased this one , but i think maybe i 'll get the next patterson release from the library . i think the two star rating pretty well sums it up
i read one page and that was enough for me . i 'm no prude .. i 've read books with graphic sex and violence but this was graphic for the sake of being graphic . this book is great if you 're a sicko
the work of a <NUM> year-old without talent . phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy , inappropriate similies . story line is absurd . if this were koontz 's first novel , no publisher would touch it
yo i hate when people like ja dont speak the truth . he talks about all this ( ... ) like he went through it but hes just lying . he 's a wanksta and im not sayin that cause i support <NUM> cause i hate <NUM> . but hes got a point when he talks about ja . if your a ja fan you are being lied to and wasting your money when your supporting a true wanksta . yo ja stop stealing pac 's words if he were alive he would never role wit you . if you want to be lied to and hear the most annoying voice and waste your money by this album or other ja albums
this is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass . oh , and i do n't sit in my room on saturdays playing card games , either . but having fun does n't mean `` get drunk 24/7 for four years '' . there 's something called having a life that this book totally misses but , well , it 's for college kids , and they 're mostly idiots
i feel like crying right now , literally . i suppose that i saw this coming , even though i 'd give anything to avoid it : the goo goo dolls have straight up sold out , and no other band could dissapoint me more than they could . the goo goo dolls were the sole band that brought me through my teens , and probably had the single most early influence on my taste in music . no other band had the intensity , musically and emotionally , that these guys captured on their earlier albums ( albums like jed , hold me up , superstar carwash , or a boy named goo for all of you who started with dizzy ) . the complete lack of words to describe the feeling a certain song gives you -- you know what i 'm talking about- these guys had it in everything they did . had it , past tense . their progression that critics tote as `` maturing , '' alas , was the dolls slow descent into what they 've become now . we ( longtime fans ) saw it and silently groaned to ourselves , not able to admit to ourselves that it was happening . it started with dizzy up the girl ( with what , for or five singles ? get serious ) . do n't get me wrong , i enjoy that album , but only because it still has some of the magic that made the goo goo dolls what they were . the songs still felt real . gutterflower was the real omen ; but at least the songs were still somewhat interesting , musically . and so it comes to this , another great band ruining itself . trust me , i tried desperately to like this cd . desperately . but it does n't feel real . the lyrics are cheesy . the musicianship is way below par ( as compard to their creative ability and talent ) . the songs are forgetable and all sound the same . the only song i found somewhat enjoyable was `` listen . '' ( the only taste of real ggd i could find on this cd ) . ( and only two songs with robby on vocals ? its a shame . his raspy voice is beautiful . ) its hurts me immensely to say these things about john and robby . they 've been my idols for more than half of my life . it feels like a part of me is dead . sounds cheesy , but the ggd have never dissapointed me . time to face up to the facts : they finally have . i guess all good things come to an end . so if you want to hear some good music , go to the used cd store and pick up superstar carwash , and hear what this really great band used to sound like .
i rank this book slightly higher than season of the machete , simply because i only got to page <NUM> of that book before giving up on it . i finished this book , but it was hardly an enjoyable read . the one positive is that the chapters are very short , so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace . the actual content , however , is very poor . this book is just surviving off the past cross novels . if someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior cross novels , they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving cross 's estranged son , his other two kids , this new love life , etc . i 've read all the books leading up to this book , and i barely cared or understood what was going on . compare this to kiss the girls or jack and jill , and it comes up way short . the story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed . nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat , and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist . this was by far the worst of the cross books .
<NUM> volume series ? he man could have easily compressed this into <NUM> pages , but he 's so long winded with everything . and reading this feels like i 'm standing at the front door with jehova 's witnesses . ender 's game was great . it deserves <NUM> stars . but i 'm almost convinced it was written by someone else
there is a problem with the dvd , it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary
i own a large collection of hypnosis books and this one has to be the most lame , poorly written and uninformative book on this subject i have come across . if you are a hippy-dippy new age moron this book is for you , but if you are looking for a real book on hypnosis , avoid this book or waste your money . nuff said
seriously , is there anyone who can tell me just what the hell this album is supposed to be called ? * sigh * , these idiots do n't even know how to spell properly . anyway , this album , by far , is probably the worst of all the lil ' john attrocities , which is saying a lot since lil ' john really is a horrible artist
started the book and put it down as i was not very interest in hearing the author 's personal journey as i was interested in learning this style of self defense . the illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine ! ! i however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book
i was expecting a college comedy with plenty of college girl t & a . but the t & a was minimal , only a couple of quick scenes . and the movie was only slightly entertaining . since the movie was n't very entertaining for me ( a male ) , and most of the stars of the movie are female ... and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots ( fools ) , and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority .... i 'm thinking this movie must be a `` chick flick '' ... a movie for girls . guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting , but they will be disappointed . some paris hilton fans may like the movie , but be sure to note that paris hilton does not get naked in this movie ( ... but a few other girls get topless ) . i would n't be surprised to see some girls disagreeing with my assumption that this movie is a `` chick flick '' ... maybe its just a little dull for everyone ... ( barely watchable )
i did n't like this album that much . only songs i liked are the mc , step into a world , a friend , ca n't stop wo n't stop . just to prove a point song was horrible and i do n't know why he tried to do a rock song . putting puff daddy on the step into a world remix was a terrible decision by krs . the songs were too short on this album also .
this book is inexplicably influential , probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title . barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis , instead delivering an exasperating <NUM> page-long list of every single thing on earth that he disagrees with . barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world , while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness . interestingly , barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance , using each other 's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior . that is a fascinating thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating . the first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists , of cultural trends that barber disdains , in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary . it 's all tied together with attempts at `` edgy '' pop culture references , made-up terminology ( like the annoying `` infotainment telesector '' ) , and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping . all is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term `` mcworld , '' which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless . in his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses , barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior , or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days , or both . in the second part of the book , barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots , in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states . his umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term `` jihad . '' note that this book was published back in <NUM> , so that word was not as prevalent in western discourse as it is now , but barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout muslims and ardent anti-islamists . when it comes to the specifics , many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in barber 's arguments , and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task . you can agree or disagree with various critiques of barber 's contentions based on your own personal politics . but everyone will probably conclude that in this book 's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis ( embodied in the book 's title ) , and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector . overall , this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world .

the story is quite clunky and contrived , and yet , i still ca n't help but feel some affection for it , as , despite my opinions of mr. roeder 's talents , he clearly feels deeply for his characters , and their none-to-realistic world . the good things are here -- while the characters are cardboard cut-outs , and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers , their plight is still quite a bit involving . my negatives , though , really spring from the way the plot unfolds -- far too quickly and far too coincidental . i know that the chamber of horrors at the `` mental hospital '' is not far removed from reality , but for a lot of the story , the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear . and i ca n't quite parse the way mr. roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting , and then throws on paranormal experiences . as escapist literature , i 've read worse , but for something that seems to be striving towards realism , i just do n't know
this batman movie is one of the worst batman movies . although the movie suffers from a super silly feel , i still think it might be better than the melodramatic batman begins . val kilmar is the worst batman ever . not bad special effects in this <NUM> 's movie . the batman franchise died with this movie . the only two good batman movies are batman and batman returns . although this movie stinks , it has good special features . music videos , making of docs , interviews , dleted scenes : it has all the works . i would pick it up only if you are a huge batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise i would just save my money
when i first started to get into doo wop , back in the early '70 's , the records of the channels were some of my favorites . i played `` the closer you are '' a zillion times on my stereo . it just had this a particularly striking sound that you could n't put into words . earl lewis ' voice , to me at that time . was unlike nothing i 'd ever heard , and nothing i 'd ever hear again . i was caught up by the beauty of the `` new york sound '' , and loved it . the same was true with many of the other channels records that i got to add to my collection . to me , they were always at the top of my favorites list , or close to it . nothing could dissuade from loving each and every one of their records . until , in <NUM> , reality set in . i saw them live at a `` rock and roll revival '' show , at the academy of music theater , in manhattan . they were billed , along with <NUM> other groups , in a outstanding show . once the channels showed up on stage , one problem became obvious : earl lewis could n't sing to save his life . and these , supposedly , were the best years of his voice . true , he attempted to get through `` the closer you are '' , `` the gleam in your eye '' , `` that 's my desire '' , and several of their other local hits with the group . but every time he did so , it became apparent that the guy had no pitch . he just could n't find the notes . the result was one of the worst listening experiences of my life . `` pain in my heart '' was a pain in my ears . you could say that earl simply had a bad night . i wish that was the case , but every time i saw them on stage , probably six times in all , through the next four years , featured along with a number of other groups in other shows , it was the same story . when the group backed away , and earl lewis had his solo parts to do , he was about as sour and as off-key as a singer could get . ( that 's still the case , even these days . ) and what was remarkable to me was how the auduence , at every show , never noticed . they applauded and cheered , as though everything was just the way it should 've been . how sad . there was more attention placed on the nostalgia of the song , than how well or poorly it was performed . these experiences made me go back to my collecton , and listen to my channels records with some better insight . i began to think that on a few of them , earl lewis simply got lucky on a few takes , and actually found the notes ! the backup group , while adequate ( and also somewhat off-key ) , is n't the greatest ensemble to hear , either . for proof , listen to their disastrous version of `` that 's my desire '' , and compare it to the flamingos ' recording . for better , exquisite singing , check out the harptones , the moonglows , the jive five , the dubs , or anything by the flamingos . in my opnion , as far as the records of the chanels are concerned , the best of the bunch are `` bye bye baby '' and `` my love for you will never die '' . they were a better than average ( on a few of their recordings ) ny group , but hardly worthy of the praise they 're given . and believe me : until i saw them live , i used to be awed by what i thought was incredible talent . not anymore . i hate to burst anybody 's bubble , but it helps to put it all in perspective
how the other half lives was written over a century ago as an expose ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of new york city . the author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . this is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of new york city in the late 1800s . he so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people 's plight . his pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . he , for the most part , blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions : `` how shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . '' ( p. <NUM> ) . he laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor . then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers . riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page <NUM> when he says , `` if this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . '' the author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : `` this book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major u. s . cities . '' how does this book relate to adult education ? by moving chronologically from the founding of america to the slums of nyc in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? certainly riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man . '' ( p. <NUM> ) . he does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords . `` clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. <NUM> ) . riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` it is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . '' ( p. <NUM> ) . the relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society . although this book was exhaustive in its detail , it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening . i found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that riis used for the different races . in a sense it reads like a ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era . read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm : jewtown , bandit 's roost , double alley , the bowery , the bloody sixth ward , the fourth , fifth and tenth wards , blindman 's alley , the bend , the battery , little italy , the french quarter , hell 's kitchen , the west side , bottle alley , frog hollow , poverty gap , murderer 's alley , gotham court , the old brewery , old africa , potter 's field , blackwell 's island asylum , rogues ' gallery , penitentiary row , chinatown . the list goes on . to someone reared in rural america , this chant sounds like a song about another country . riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of new york city : chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( chinese ( coolie -- laundry business ) , polish jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , russian jew , jew ( money is their god ) , bohemian ( poor , but thrifty ) , blacks ( like to gamble , but they are clean ) , greek , hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , dutchman , irish ( like to drink and have expensive funerals ) , german ( order loving ) , swiss , pasquales , russian , italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , swamp angel ( thieves ) , street arabs ( army of homeless boys ) , tramps and toughs ( the world owes them a living ) , and the celtics . i was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and riis ' comments about every race . i noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day . riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday . i hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days . does every generation think that is happening in their time ? not only should this book be used by people researching new york city ` s tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change . it is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for human dignity .
a long long time ago i can still remember how my sister used to play his songs and in the 80s changed his style songs like love touch were so vile and forever young was on the charts too long but this whole series makes me shiver with each new horror it delivers bad and cheesy music it always makes me so sick i ca n't remember if i spewed when i heard him sing `` it had to be you '' but his integrity tore in two the day the music died
i saw this a few nights ago on regular late night tv , so maybe it was edited to death and i missed all the interesting parts ? ? ? ? all i know is that it seemed highly unbelievable ... spoilers follow .... ( ... why does the rapist just walk in her front door ... would you leave your door unlocked if you had just been attacked and the rapist had your driver 's license ? ! ! ) anyways ... i could n't get past that part through the whole movie , so maybe that 's what made me hate it . i do have to give kudos to farah fawcett though , her acting was excellent and seemed very genuine ... maybe she has been through some similar trauma in real life ?
although vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher , it is not enough to research well ; one must also be a writer , and vestal 's embarrassing attempts to mimic bridger 's speech is a travesty . from inane , trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction , it is clear that vestal needed a much stronger editor . recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research
john carradine gives a great performance but the story is hard to swallow and there 's not enough of tor johnson . worth a look . great opening credits
very dissappointing , has nothing to do with the kickboxing saga , a production the could of done without , david sloan dies ......... lol.common really even i couldnt believe it , see the movie for a good laugh , nothing else
my impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author 's in this subject matter have ever presented . for eg. , & quot ; people crossing hands in front of their chest means that they are n't accepting what you are telling them. & quot ; that is the most typical statement i have ever heard , and this tape is full of them . there is nothing enlightening , nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape . i felt it was not good use of time or money . fo
considering the sensational cast ( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy and brock peters ) , the euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot , ace high is a major disappointment . the plot is uninvolving and incoherent , the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style , the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever . the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife . after the first ten minutes , i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it . a boring <NUM> minute piece of junk , ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series . save your fistful of dollars for a better film
okay , i 've discovered the worst director ever , bar none . i 've watched three of hollywood b-movie veteran director jean yarbrough recently ( the brute man , the over-the-hill gang , and now hillbillys in a haunted house ) and this is one bad-nasty awful director . othg was a criminal waste of a veteran cast of character actors heading rapidly towards the sunset . brute man was exploitation unleavened with insight or humanity . hillbillys in a haunted house is hick humor for those who find don knotts ' movies too difficult to follow . these films are monuments to blown opportunities , stagnant and unimaginative direction , comedy that makes us groan and horror that makes us laugh . avoid the scenes with basil rathbone if at all possible . it 's apparent he 'd suffered a stroke prior to this movie and his distinct enunciation is noticeably slurred , making it difficult for a fan to watch . about the only highlights here are when the country music stars ( ferlin husky and merle haggard , especially ) strap on the guitars and sing .
i liked very much the film black orpheus , but when i bought this record i hoped to listen the music , not the movie . most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs , as would be heard in the movie . then why not buying the movie ? when i listen a cd i care about music , that is contaminated in this record . and does n't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently . besides , the art of the cover is very poor , dishonors the movie , and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus , recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear , improperly : the `` oh no ! '' sound of `` frevo '' that is commented does not apear in the movie as said . as a summary , verve did wonderfull editions of jazz , but this edition falls far behind the standards of both verve and the film ; clearly , brazilian music does n't seems to be verve territory judging buy this edition
the authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history . they especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic , healing , or toxic qualities . only trouble is , i find it hard to trust the authors ' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas . for example , they claim that henry viii had syphilis , passed it on to his children , and therefore none of them lived past infancy . ummm ... except for the * three * who grew up to rule england ? and in a table of plants sacred to various greek goddesses , they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to hera , but do not connect it to persephone at all , which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth . then , they go on to talk about witches ' flying ointments and how deadly they were -- but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance . there may very well be treasures in this book . i 'd just be too afraid to trust the authors ' accuracy
i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd . we were barely able to make it through one listening . this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist ( using the term very loosely ) not already been famous for something besides music . the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling . it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating . i want my money back
i absolutely could not believe this cartoon . can you imagine a superhero using swear words ? well , that 's what you have with this one . still ca n't believe it . what on earth are they trying to do with spiderman ? this obviously is a series for adults because , quite frankly , superheroes are supposed to be out for justice , truth and the american way , not to spend time in the gutter learning all the trash they can to spread it wherever . i do n't recommend this product at all . ours is going into the trash
do not be fooled by the lure of `` six full length model tests . '' the tests are in paper form . barron 's is a very paper-heavy book . you will get more practice through kaplan 's test prep as they have many computer-based exams
i really could n't wait to get this cd . i wanted so badly to like it . but - it is just too bluegrassy for me . every single song . it would be great one or two songs , but every song gets old . plus , the recording quality does n't seem that great . you can barely hear the words , and most kids want to sing along . jenny jenkins is a fun song , and shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful , but for the kids and no ! are way better cd 's
`` cursed '' is the most pathetic werewolf movie i 've seen since `` an american werewolf in paris '' . the acting is terrible , directing is poor ( shame on you mr. craven ) and the storyline is largely uncompelling . the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience . this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is `` cool '' , but if you 're looking for a scary movie , do n't look for `` cursed '' . well , at least it 's not as bad as `` an american werewolf in paris '' , but that sure as hell is n't saying much .
i believe the quality of this transfer ( along with the one for raise the red lantern ) is so horrific that it completely ruines the beautiful experience of watching these gong li/ zhang yimou movies and should not even be offered for sale . truly ba
this cd is not good . luckily , i only paid <NUM> bucks for the used copy . i mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs ? i do n't . the couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets <NUM> stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves . bruce really took a page from gene 's book here and went after the money . should be an ep and nothing more
this movie is very gross . this movie is horrible . the movie is a disgrace to the movie industry . i am so glad that i had got this cheap . i will be getting rid of it . it would be an insult to my dvd collection for me to keep this video . this movie is a waste of everything used to make this movie . it was also a big waste of my time . `` howard the duck '' was better than this . this movie was just flat out horrible. ! ! ! ! i used to collect gpk stickers i thought they were cool . to see this movie i am just apalled i did n't know there was a movie out there so horrible .
i ca n't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd . this is a great movie , do n't get me wrong . it 's kurasawa , after all . my one star is for the people at mei ah who put out this dvd . whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak english well enough to graduate from a level one esl class . the subtitles are truly terrible , sometimes bizarre , and i thought at times i was dreaming i was watching a monty python skit . alas , i was not ; this was for real . such a shame
this is the story of cassie , who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la . cassie suffers from amnesia and we do n't know what brought her there , until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife . this is by far the most disappointing of picoult 's books , and i 've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers . cassie is amnesic , yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened . the story goes back and forth between the present , the past , the memories , and leaves readers lost in the middle . i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending . chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion . what is frustrating is that it takes picoult <NUM> pages to make her character realise the obvious . i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing , let alone her husband alex , a massive egocentric . the story was very confused , mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa , with anthropology , indian legends , domestic violence , alcoholism , amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused . if you want a superb story of domestic violence , read black & blue by anna quindlen . if you want a good picoult book , read the pact or my sister 's keeper , but definitely not picture perfect
because the guy who initiated the project of writing the book is here at rice , the rest of us are unlucky enough to have to use this book . if your class uses this book , prepare to go to class . all the time . that 's because if you fall behind , the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you . examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section . a lot of the time , i 'd find myself stumped on a problem , looking back , and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from . yes there are lots of problems and that 's good , in a way . but what 's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them ? furthermore , it is a poorly written book . generally , reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack . literally speaking . you spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out , it was not even worth all that time . so go to class . all the time . if the prof isnt that great , get yourself another workbook . i havent seen schaum 's but i 'm pretty sure they 'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does
the premise - that one could change specific events in ones ' past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller . i do n't condemn the film 's corollary either : that each change produces new , unforseeable tragedies . it 's the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot , its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities . it is therefore fitting that the director 's preferred ending is included here . it is the perfect catharsis for teens who `` ... wish i was never born !
after watching this film i decided to be scientific and use the process of elimination to determine how someone might have been able to appreciate it since i had n't . aesthetics is , after all , a subjective experience , so a little objective rigor brought to bear on enjoyable experiences others might have had watching this movie should theoretically enable me to expand my own repertoire of aesthetic responses . the first way one could not have found enjoyment watching this film is by being seduced by the exotic locales . yes , there was a pan that lasted for about a minute of a pretty czech village , but otherwise the newtonian law of cinematics has once again been confirmed , and here 's the proof : in the bollywood movie , humtum , a scene that was meant to occur in paris was filmed on the museumplein in amsterdam ; so the equal and opposite gaffe was bound to be committed somewhere . in hostel , scenes meant to occur in amsterdam have been filmed ( jarringly ) in prague . and just like they did with the americans in borat , i can imagine ( in the cynical frame of mind this movie put me in ) the filmmakers telling european colleagues and extras , `` do n't worry , it does n't matter - we 'll never show this in your country . '' well , it eventually mattered to the fratboy who wanted to bring slavery back , and it should have mattered to the filmmakers . qed . after also eliminating direction , script , and acting as potential means for appreciating this movie i started to worry . yes , much thought had obviously gone into making this thing ; but the dusk-to-dawn pleasure/pain structure and obscure references did n't mesh well with the low-budget sinister spin on european vacation . worse , the unfortunate juxtaposition of beautiful naked flesh and extreme torture in this film exerts a pernicious influence on the psyche of the viewer - surely that could n't have been intended . and then , like being shot by a diamond bullet right through my forehead , it became clear that i 'd completely missed the point . this is a message film , and i 'd been stupid not to pick up on the movie 's lofty ambitions . the next challenge was to decipher the message , and i tell you this is the part that took the most time . at first i suspected a sort of buried agenda to keep americans from traveling outside their country . the lesson seemed so clear that sublimely beautiful european temptresses want our dollars , but they will <NUM> ) mock us at every opportunity for not being cool in an effeminate , european way , <NUM> ) shield their true intentions by brazenly conspiring against us to our face in their unfamiliar native tongues , <NUM> ) have an almost psychic rapport with thuggish male fellow-countrymen who intend to punish us for having both the motive ( wanting to have sex with beautiful girls ) and opportunity ( lots of aforesaid dollars and girls with loose morals ) to steal their women , <NUM> ) ultimately sell us over to be tortured because they 'll do anything for money ( those loose morals again ) , and <NUM> ) succeed in their nefarious plan because the rule of law ends at the us border . but this interpretation sounded paranoid when i played it back , and i suspected the ultra-violence of the movie had once again influenced my state of mind . what if this do-not-leave-the-us message was really the unintentional result of some other process at work in the filmmakers ' master plan ? so i started listening to the commentary track for more insight , but it was really irritating and i could n't listen to the whole thing . they 've apparently re-coined the expression , ` bully ' , which must be a sort of teddy roosevelt macho thing . their country 's recent actions around the world have made many americans feel self-conscious and unloved abroad . it 's unrealistic to think all the issues caused by this will be resolved so soon after the trauma . americans have a very pronounced sense of national identity , and we should expect some confused , troubled people doing things that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves . also ; paying women for sex has a long history , and i would n't think to question its place in society . however , like all those things we 're taught from childhood are wrong , paying for sex sets off a complex chain reaction of deep , conflicting emotions . it 's not always pretty to see these emotions being worked through , and unintentionally choosing film as the medium to do this was probably a mistake . having exhausted all other reasonable avenues , i 've come to the scientific conclusion that the only way to appreciate this movie is to share the sensibilities , sensitivities , and neuroses of the filmmakers ; and i find these to be distasteful . this film helps to mark a key boundary of aesthetic territory , and like the man said : `` you never know what 's enough until you know what 's too much . ''
i was disappointed by this book . i am a solo litigation attorney , and i read the book to get ideas on marketing . it gave me some ideas . perhaps the most valuable idea was to focus more on customer service ; dahut has an interesting discussion about exactly what that means and how we can do it better . by and large , however , this is a book by and for big firm attorneys . it is about big firm angst and how it can be combated by hiring experts such as dahut to do extensive consulting work for your firm . dahut does not acknowledge , and does not care , that most attorneys are solos or work in small firms , and that we have very different issues than agonizing over whether we have lost our soul by conforming to much to dead firm culture
i do not find this cd funny in the least bit . the song `` because i got high '' has got to be the dumbest thing ever written , with one of the most boring beats and repetitive lyrics that i have ever heard . also , there are other dumb songs like `` she wo n't let me '' . he tries so hard to be funny to the teenage crowd , and in some ways he succeeds , but to most people , i think that he will just be another annoying comedy rapper that us music listeners dont need to hear
i know that this cd set is great , that is why i ordered it . i however got an e-mail after i had already ordered the item that i found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the `` quality of the item was n't good . '' what sort of bad advertising is that ? it is n't my fault that they priced it wrong , and if there was a mistake i should have received it anyway . it is n't fair , and i want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website .
i certainly agree that portis is a talented writer , but i just did n't find him all that funny . perhaps i 'm missing something , but i thought that the characters were strange enough , not amusing , just strange . i was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited . i forced myself to finish the book and i was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book , which comes at the very end of the novel
first of all this is the worst animation i 've seen in my life ! ! ! there like what 14-16 and they look like they have fake lips ! their hair is the worst ! ! ! overall .... hated it ! ! !
i think it is tragic that such an excellent intstrumental performance should be marred by some very unpleasant vocalizing . i ca n't understand why so many fans take it for granted . i would rate keith jarrett very high as a pianist ; in the same league as herbie hancock and chick corea ; if only he could keep his mouth shut while he plays his pianistic miracle
i love this show ! that said , i do not care for this version of it . the inclusion of the word `` concept '' in the title means it is just that . this was , thankfully , not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song , `` one night in bangkok '' . with most broadway musicals , the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show . if you listen to the recordings of phantom , mama mia , beauty and the beast , you can discern the basic storyline of the show . listening to this particular recording of chess , though , will leave you wondering `` what was that ? '' the broadway arrival of chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers . this recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that do n't really relate to each other . for musical fanatics ( like myself ) , i say `` yes , you should have this recording in your collection '' , if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on broadway . if you are only buying the album because of `` one night in bangkok '' , purchase the broadway recording instead ; you 'll be much happier with the performance by phillip casnoff rather than murray head
this was a great disappointment . waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made ! i love waylon jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing . i 'm sure if the recording had of been better quality i would have loved this
like the title states , the tape was of poor quality and skipped alot , making viewing difficult , and it is to much of a pain and just as costly to ship back.i do not recommend buying from this media distributer
this is not a review of this compilation , but please note , csny fans , that while their version of `` woodstock '' may be the more familiar one , the song was written by joni mitchell . listen to her own ( comletely different ) performance of it on her `` ladies of the canyon '' ( <NUM> ) album
really , the whole movie sucks . let 's start from the top , the plot . now , as you probably know , the plot has nothing to do with the game , at all . in fact , the only thing remotely close they have is the name , and the bfg . the plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day , you know the drill . nothing horribly bad , except for it does n't follow the game at all . however , this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on earth , and now mars . really . first , we have the kid , who is horrible at everything , he talks while he 's supposed to be stealthy , he gets high on mission , etc . yes , it 's his mission , but i thought this was an elite military team , not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training . and portman , not only is a moron , but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he 's saying . now , as for genres . for a horror movie , it 's not scary at all , not even a little suspense ( though i kinda wanted the characters to die , so i guess that lost the suspense to me ) . for an action movie , well , simply put , there 's little to know action , until the very end . and yes , there 's a first person shooter sequence towards the end , but don ; t be fooled , that is a gimmick and nothing more . without spoiling anything , i 'm just gon na say that the ending is incredibly generic . all in all , this movie is a waste of time and money .
nietzsche , who started all this , may or may not have been the deepest thinker since socrates , but he was a stylistic virtuoso . deleuze and guattari , on the other hand , were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is : obscurity = profundity . but while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure , by no means all obscure things are profound . this book , which runs to <NUM> pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought , is in line for the prestigious prize , the golden merde de taureau . it contains , along with much else , the authors ' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus , which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math . others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all , just as the passages about science are not about science , and they may be right . what , if anything , it is about is anyone 's guess , and many have speculated , some to their own satisfaction . one thing we can be sure of , because the authors tell us : they are creating concepts . this important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought . the book was a bestseller in france - possibly the most unread bestseller since a ' a brief history of time ' , but for different reasons
let me preface this by saying i am a big fan of traditional irish music , and a huge fan of dervish , trian , liz carroll , bothy band , kevin burke , andy irvine , etc . this is the first solas cd i have bought , and will probably be the last . although generally very competently played , the music just does n't speak to me . i agree with the some of the other reviews to that effect that this solas recording is too highly orchestrated , and not very traditional ( though i do n't mind that , per se ) . in my opinion & quot ; last of the great whales & quot ; has some of the lamest and simple-minded lyrics i 've ever heard . though she has a very pleasing voice , ms. scanlon 's rendition of it just fails to move me whatsoever ( lacking in musicality , i believe one reviewer said ) . in my book her renditions just do n't compare to mary black , susan mckeown , or karan casey , though they are pleasant enough . the fiddle playing on & quot ; a little child & quot ; reminds me more of a classical violinist playing irish music .... very good tone , but too much vibrato , and too orchestrated with multiple violin tracks sounding like the london philharmonic ( e.g . when my love & amp ; i parted ) . on the positive side , there is some excellent guitar , flute , and button accordian playing on here ( e.g . cahil 's jig ) . it 's as if the band is trying too hard to distance themselves from the many other traditional irish groups , with the result that the arrangements are overly complex , and the material just is n't that interesting
i picked this album up , expecting the same level of quality as past eagles albums ( such as the thrilling desperado ) , however , it seems the only quality songs on this album are the hits , which can be just as easily obtained by purchasing the hits volume ii , a much better album . the rest of the album is lame and uninspired , and is ultimately not worth your money
walter mosley 's `` easy rawlins '' series is well plotted , the characters are well thought out , and the stories are very original . i am a fan of his new `` fearless jones '' series , which does a lot to explain racism in 1950s los angeles . nothing i 've read about walter mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite . this book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that i 've read in years . i 've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets . the story is totally trash , you know the ending before you get past the beginning , the characters are ridiculous , and the sex scenes are even worse ( hard to ruin sex , but he does it ) . if this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published . it would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them
i want to know why just a few days ago , tender years was on this album and why it 's not there now . without tender years , this album is n't worth .2/ believe me , my company wo n't even sponsor the deeid and the cruisers albums anymore
* warning : spoiler * i can not believe people , excuse me , some women are giving this movie four and five stars . interesting premise , and it could have been a good , believeable movie -- but it was sooo syrupy . if this is what it 's like to be in love , please somebody shoot me ( note : i 've been in real love for <NUM> years now . ) i got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a <NUM> and a half until the very end . why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a `` good movie '' ? i felt like i was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over . would n't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out ? that , at least , would have made the movie more intriquing , believeable and redeeming . if ever a movie was made to force tears , this is it . this movie stinks and i do n't mind telling you so -- and it 's not just because i 'm a man either . imo , there 's not much difference between this movie and a stupid , blatant steven segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it 's the elixir of heaven . same coin , different sides . the movie should be given a `` one '' -- no a `` negative one '' just for the stupid ending , but other redeeming factors make it a `` two . '' still not worth seeing -- i.e. , unless you 're into infuriating yourself . * * note : even my wife and daughter -- both chick-flick connousiours -- hate this movie.i have n't checked yet , but i think my dogs do too . * * another note : these two good actors needed a better movie . see ryan in the superb `` courage under fire '' , or the jim morrison movie , or `` when harry met sally '' -- which i do n't categorize as a `` chick flick '' but as a good romantic comedy , i.e. , not contrived
any one who is a fan of luther vandross will be sorry if you purchase this cd . it 's not a tribute ....... it an abomination
the princess blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie , <NUM> 's lady snowblood . it 's not like they try to hide that fact - it 's a homage , not a rip-off . the japanese name of both films , shurayuki-hime , is identical , and the two main characters even have the same name , yuki . in japanese , `` shura '' is a buddhist term very like `` hell '' or `` netherworld , '' a place of violence and carnage . `` yuki '' mean `` snow '' and is a common girl 's name . `` hime '' means `` princess '' or `` lady . '' `` shurayuki-hime '' is also a play on `` shirayuki-hime , '' the japanese name for snow white . all this according to the movie notes on the lady snowblood dvd . in lady snowblood , in meiji japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs . after the murders , the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days . surviving that ordeal , she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible . she offs the first one but is then captured and jailed . dying in prison in childbirth , she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she 's old enough . for what it is , this is an extraordinarily well done film . even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we 'd expect from a seventies japanese samurai flick , there are also moments in lady snowblood that are eerily beautiful . in the princess blade , in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi , yuki 's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins . betrayed by one of her own , she 's also tortured for three days , but in this case does n't survive the experience . the daughter , unaware how her mother died - she 's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself . not until she 's almost <NUM> does she discover the gang leader is also her mother 's murderer . after trying and failing to kill him , she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there . if i may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment : i believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film , of any genre , as long as it 's well done . look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved ghost in the shell . the princess blade is low-budget , hyper-violent , japanese chop-socky . it 's well enough done that if you 're already a fan of such movies , you 'll probably enjoy it . however , unlike lady snowblood , the princess blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal , i.e . it just wo n't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film . if you 're a genre fan , i 'd say of the princess blade , go for it . if not , and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character , i suggest passing on the princess blade and watching lady snowblood instead ( now available in an absolutely superb dvd transfer , by the way ) . you 'll enjoy the experience immensely more
i enjoyed separation sunday tremendously , an original ( although not for everyone ) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match . as a thitrysomething , i found the lyrics on sep. sun . to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time , with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood , or reaching your own `` resurrection '' . this new album ( boys and girls ) is much more drab , with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that i would be emarrased to listen to if i were older than <NUM> . these are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the mtv generation , with cheesy lines and hooks . i had thought this band was the real deal , and had argued as such , but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers .
i received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping . i notified amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem . i received a credit and amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out . thanks billy lede
for <NUM> years there was no seperation fence or 'apartheid wall ' built by israel to stop the human assaults of suicide bombers . but this is the cover of this book and points to what is really going on here . the argument is simple , had zionism not existed there would be no arab-israeli conflict . had israel created a palestinian state , that he jordanians refused to from 1948-1967 , there would have been peace . the entire onus for any conflict in the middle east rests with israel . this is an interesting argument . israel is unique in being one of the few states created by an ideology , rather than an ideology rising out of a nation ( rather zionism rose out of the jewish nation , but not in its present borders ) . however it is not the only example . the risorgimento in italy is responsible for odern italy and in a number of other pleace latent ideologies have done the same , creating nations out of loose federations . after all modern moldova has little historical merit and neither does kosovo . for that matter most of the borders of the arab states also arise out of modern ideology , especially the borders of modern turkey . only apparently in israel is this a problem . the reason is remarkably simple , only in israel did the creation of the new state result in <NUM> yeas of warfare . other 'old ' conflicts like that over kashmir are likely a result of the same . but we do not readily argue that the existence of india is responsible for the kashmir conflict . it would be hard to imagine the title of an book about another nation being 'the case against .. ' for instance 'the case against germany ' . therein lis the illogic of this book . a case can not be made against the existence of a state . there can be no 'case against japan ' . even if all the arguments are correct , the solution , the disappearence of israel as a state , is not only genocidal in its intentions but illogical in its premise . seth j. frantzan
although i agree with several of mr. stamper 's recommendations ( legalizing prostitution , decriminalizing drugs ) , many of his assertions are straight out of the `` i-hate-america '' handbook . all white , male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist , homophobic , women-hating thugs . what we need is a kinder , gentler way of policing . mr. stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began . he `` confesses '' that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin ' da . it was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in , and soon he was a supervisor ( all the better to control the average joe ) . the unfortunate thing about this book is n't the stories he relates , or even his recommendations ( some good , some not so good ) , but the haughty way in which he relates it . conservatives , republicans - bad ! liberals , democrats - good ! ( except for unions - bad ! ) if this book were written with respect not only for the majority of rank and file cops , but for the other half of americans that mr. stamper obviously disdains , it may have been worth the money . as it is , if you are to the right of hillary , take a pass on this one
the corrs are good at what they do .. trad-orientated pop , but on this album , i feel that they have lost their way a little . always difficult to follow a 'talk on corners ' , but this album is just average , at best . there are some nice tracks here like 'all the love in the world ' , 'radio ' and 'breathless ' but apart from these , nothing else really rises to the challenge . lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others
people actually gave this movie <NUM> stars ! are they for real ? if you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you . it is fun to watch , but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking . it is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are . their are so many scar face ripoffs it 's offencive , and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said `` okay , we do n't have much film left , we got ta ' rap this up real quick . dmx , find religion ... and cut . '' rent the movie , try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying , ignore the horrible acting of naz , then return it . and when you review it please do n't give it five stars , those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop , not just some `` phat movie you and some down ass playas ' watched while moms was outta ' da ' house .
uneven , choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable meryl streep . unfortunately , not even the fabulous ms. streep can save this -- recommended for devoted fans only , bent on completing their streep collection
one great ballad , evermore without you , doth not a musical make . that song is stunning , slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding . the rest of the show is simply dreadful . some is downright irritating . '' a secret , a secret ..... '' , that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails . horrible . i have a secret , stay away from this ridiculous mess . the plot is ludicrous , and the performances dull . they all sing it like they know how awful it is . and michael crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career . hopefully someone like barbara cook or john barrowman will record evermore without you , so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash . sir andrew , c'mon , surely you can come up with something better than this
there really was good bits to this book . unfortunately , her accusation against bible translators as being male and therefore biased against passages that dealt with women seemed terribly harsh if not arrogant . the basic line of reason goes as follows : `` all bible translators are bigots and have gotten this passage wrong . 'authority ' in the this biblical passage really does n't mean 'authority'in the greek . '' what does it mean ? hubcap
secret agent was quite a disappointment , considering the makeup of the cast : gerard depardieu , robin williams , bob hoskins , christian bale , and patricia arquette among others . the movie brings to the screen the story of an englishman , living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of london . things , however , are not as they seem in 19th century london , with spies , double agents , anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day ... in short , the acting is surprisingly average ( ! ) , the setting is pretty good , while the dialogues and the plot are below average . the movie has that sherlock holmes feel about it , but without the `` magic , '' meaning that in the end you are left ... numb , and wondering : `` was that it ? '' as for the rating , it could have been pg-13 . though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off . a shame really ...
i have great respect for charles jencks as an architect , and as a critic of art relating to such . therefore the book should be retitled , what is postmodern architecture ? or what is everything about post-modernism except the art ? the main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created the art , rather then the art . seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject since <NUM> . i was hoping for something which would address the art , but i was sorely disappointed . the constant focus on the world around the buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull ( it got to the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the book interesting ) . the focus of postmoderism was once architecture , however , now the focus has shifted , it seems everyone except the academics know this . not only was his sections on art and literature stupid , but incorrect , and blunderingly light . i expected more from jencks , being the great mind of the century he was . if you want to know anything helpful and relevant pretaining to post modernism today , do not read this book . but hey if you want to know about your father 's post modernism , read this book
i was looking to get the dvd of dazed and confused but got the cd . when it was advertised on the amazon website it led me to believe that it was a dvd as you see it above . ( <NUM> film ) i had to return it and my expense . very disappointing transaction with amazon . threfore , i am not impressed
since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs , here are my blurbs : `` really hard to get into ... tough to follow who 's who ... '' `` opens strong , but fizzles out early ... '' `` i literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ... '' `` you 'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ...
i have read many , but never written a review before . i felt compelled this time . i recently purchased this cd and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever . there are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential , is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim . thinking perhaps that i was being a musical snob , i asked the opinion of a friend . she and i laughed so hard at how awful it was , so , i went for a third opinion . the result was the same . in fact it got worse with each listening . we 've decided that it will make a nice `` booby prize '' for my next party . avoid this like the plague . it is musically inconsistent , non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation . if you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this
i know gunn is a good poet , i 've read many poems he has written that i like . but this collection is weaker than gunn 's usual work . the book does get stronger as it goes on , making section three the strongest of the three sections
the only good thing about this movie is the plot . from there it goes downhill . the script needs to be rewritten to add some sophistication to it . the acting is marginal except for the actor that plays justin . if the script were rewritten then i think the acting would be better , maybe
i have jennifer 's crunch salsa dancing dvd , and it was my first dance exercise dvd . i loved it so much i 've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor . i find the moves too difficult and frustrating . by the time you are close to having one step down , she 's moving onto the next one , and it does n't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that i enjoy in her crunch video . in that one she started out slow , repepated it several times , then did it real time , and then added another combination the same way . the end result was putting the two combinations together , so basically repeating four moves over and over , doing about six dance routines all together , which was good enough for me . when i do it now , i just go right to real time and ignore the slow start , so i have n't been bored at all . she looks great in this video , but i agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all . basically i ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles . but if i was a good dancer , this would probably be a lot of fun .
simply disastrous work by pohl . after throroughly enjoying the original gateway , i was looking forward to this sequel . my hopes were utterly shattered . in summary , here is why this book was totally unreadable . <NUM> . the main characters , stan and estrella , are totally unbelievable . their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level . they are never given any motivation for their actions . <NUM> . pohl fills the pages with useless details , including information about plantlife , and cooking , as well as vomitting and bowel movements . i gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet . maybe he was trying to be funny . it did n't work . <NUM> . total lack of plot development . the book is basically a loosely connected series of random events , stuffed with filler . mid-way through the book pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum . i have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel . it comes off as really poorly done space-opera . <NUM> . characters are completely flat . stan and estrella are both sickeningly dumb . every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout . aliens act just like humans except they talk funny . it is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality . <NUM> . book has an insane number of sex scenes , and they are all badly written . i mean literally , you cannt go more than <NUM> pages without a sex scene . so juvenile . i would go on , but i believe my point is made . this book has not a single redeeming feature . if you enjoyed gateway , do not ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel .
koopsta knicca is one of my favorite rappers but this album just didnt do it . he 's sounds alot softer now and his first album the devils playground was 3x as good
i found <NUM> factual errors in honan 's book -- when i mentioned this to someone i was told that a reader in virginia had found <NUM> . there are much better biographies of jane austen out there -- for starters , no one has yet surpassed elizabeth jenkins ' , first published in the 1930s , and a fine recent one , a good introduction to ja 's life , is maggie lane 's latest , jane austen 's world . do n't be put off by the fact that it is slick and , as they say , richly illustrated -- it 's readable , sound and remarkably complete despite its size
yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-rumours era of the band . to truly be called the very best of fleetwood mac , you would have to include at least , black magic woman , oh well , sentimental lady and hypnotized . there are many more quintessential songs from the pre-buckingham/nicks era that should be included , but those four were in heavy fm rotation in the early <NUM> 's . they exposed the band to a huge audience , which made their commercial breakthrough in <NUM> possible . to exclude them and then title this release a `` best of '' is criminal
although the script was written in the mid-1980s , `` bob roberts '' does n't feel dated . instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of american politics . the title character , bob , is a conservative folk singer who runs for the u.s. senate , but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe . what struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens . while i thought that the message of the movie was right on target , i did n't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film . it kept me at a distance from the characters and , as a result , i did n't care as much about them as i might have done
who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm ? chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too , although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm . why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies ? they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters . this movie was somewhat good , but it did n't feel all that great . so far , this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra , the incredible hulk , xmen <NUM> , daredevil , and the punisher . i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies , but after seeing what hollywood does to them , i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding . special effects were good in this movie , and so was the story . michael chiklis as the thing was great , and his the thing character makeup was done very well , and he played the character well too , as did ioan gruffud with mr . fantastic . jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie
i was a sophomore in hs and went to this cartoon with my cousins , what a mistake ! i walked out and sat in the car till it was over . it was awful . i think it is sick that even grown ups think this is so amusing to watch cartoon characters have sex . i would n't even rate it a `` <NUM> '' star . more like zero stars
my wife an i bought the book and tried the diet . we could not last the <NUM> weeks on phase <NUM> . neither of us can stand the taste of fish , so our limited choices were limited even more . the first week went okay , but by the second week , we noticed that we had become quite irritable . we did not want to see another salad , cheese stick , chicken , or lean ground beef . it was not so much that we craved breads , pastas , and candy . we missed fruit . even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase <NUM> , we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines ( the `` dreaded '' low-fat , high-fiber , portion control diet ) . in addition , we made exercise a part of our daily routine . our moods improved quickly , weight is coming off . we are getting stronger and more fit . it 's been about a month since we quit south beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it . one thing south beach did teach us was the importance of snacking . it really helps with portion control and hunger issues . only , we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt , fruit , or veggies
boy , and i thought `` cats '' was bad . this is the single most boring , stupid , pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears . there is no story line , no range in music , no feeling , no lyrics to back up the awful music . i mean , the list could go on forever . i warn you , it 's the biggest waste of $ 25.00 that you might , no , will ever spend . please , do yourself a favor and trust me . don '' t buy the cd ! ! ! and if you do , when you put it on , you 'll know exactly what i 'm talking about.you 've been warned . now please , spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life
i read dragon 's milk first and enjoyed that alot . this book proved to be a big disappointment . the story at first was so boring and lyf found herself in horrible situations . like there was no way to get out . i could n't even finish this book ! it was that boring ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i want to get the first book in this series and see whether it 's bette
if you would like some factual information underlying the glitz and glamour portayed in this video , please contact an organization on comercial sexual exploitation . we can tell you about the whipping with coat hangers combined with salt water baths , or curling iron burns all over the body followed by hot curling irons ( ... ) . sound glamorous ? all because you didnt finish up your whole box of condoms . if you believe these con-artists ( gamers ) , you are very naive . dont be ignorant , get the facts . but be prepared to deal with changing your views about the women involved in this lifestyle when you do . the only good thing artistically these films do is to evoke dynamic discussion on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation . and no , legalizing it wont make it go away
junque music . sorry i bought it . there are two songs off of the raising arizona tracks that i do like , however ... i 'm really not happy with this one at all . maybe i can go up to a pawn shop and trade it for something listenable . sorry carter
as a hornblower fan for many decades , i am very disappointed in this movie . ioan gruffud portrays a hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public hs to show he is `` cool '' or a `` big man '' . whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a `` question authority '' sticker , it is not the hornblower i know . overall , it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least gregory peck 's hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a commodore hornblower is made ... the kind of person portrayed by gruffud is , above all , childish ( as we all know , `` cool '' is the same as `` cute '' ) . perhaps the other ones with this ioan gruffud are better , but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others
my <NUM> year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this cd for christmas . it is advertised as the cheetah girls <NUM> - however these vocals are not sung by the original cheetah girls who are in the movie . the songs just do n't sound the same . it 's very dissappointing that disney does n't tell you this on the cd
although i consider `` too much time on my hands '' a guilty pleasure , styx is to rock music as pee wee herman is to pro wrestling . many years ago , i had a guy working for me who had been a roadie for styx in his younger days . he told the story of the night the entire roadie crew walked off the job -- they just could n't stand to listen to the `` music '' anymore . what else is there to say
considering he was one half of the excellent wham ! great things were expected from mr michael when he went solo . unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster . fans of classics such as wham rap , bad boys and club tropicana drinks are free will be bitterly disappointed . it seems obvious to me that andrew ridgeley had been carrying mr michael for years
i consider buckethead a unique artist with an original vision . the manifestation of that vision on his 13th anniversary dvd , while intriguing and amusing , is for only his most devoted , hard-core fans . i 've liked some of his stuff on youtube , and saw the dvd by chance passing through a cd/dvd store in a mall and took a chance . bad decision . i can go along with the `` cheapo depot '' look and vibe , but when it comes down to delivering content , this is a bloated , nearly unwatchable video . the content is presented in two disks , but it should have been one . the live concert material on disk <NUM> looks as if shot on consumer grade video cameras , featuring bucket playing along to pre-recorded tracks , doing the robot , and a display of his num-chucks skills . the music , speed-rock with doses of country chicken pickin and classical flavors , sounds largely the same from song to song . frankly , i was bored . the is an experiment gone wrong . his over-the-top dr. phibes meets yngvie meets the dark side of disney is realized as an unfocused mess on this package . the result it had on me is that i am unlikely to buy another dvd or song from him without checking into reviews first , so buyer beware . memo to buckethead : find someone to focus your vision and move on to the next phase of your career
like most people , i loved the original friday - a true classic . i had heard that this one was n't as good , so i rented a copy just to check it out for myself . this movie is straight-up garbage . mike epps ca n't carry chris tucker 's jock . what a waste of what could have been a very good movie series . stick with the original ; do n't waste your time or money on this one
even though it 's used by a lot of reviewers , i have to use it too . the opening scene has john travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how hollywood creates * * * * lately . he mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end , then later in the film he talks about harry houdini and misdirection . oddly , this film was produced by joel silver , who i can list as a creator , or at least a deliverer , of said hollywood * * * * . there 's only <NUM> reasons really to watch this film , none of which have anything to do with the story , which shows you just how the film is . stan is a talented hacker who 's been down on his luck since being released from jail . dead end job , unkempt trailer and denied rights to see his daughter . well , an opportunity comes when a woman , ginger , offers him money to meet with a man . that man , gabriel , is incredibly wealthy and will pay him <NUM> million dollars to create a computer virus that 'll net him near <NUM> billion dollars . of course , it does n't help that the feds are after both of them those <NUM> reasons ? well , the first is an incredibly awesome looking shot where we get a <NUM> slow motion pan ( it is not a full <NUM> ) after an explosion goes off and we see it 's aftermath . while the full version of the x-men last stand shot found in the special features looks better , this is just as great . the other is at the end where a helicopter flies a bus all over the city and smacking into buildings while the 3rd is of course a nude sunbathing halle berry which apparently she was paid a handsome sum of money for each breast shown . however , that 's kind of where the good parts end . the biggest problem is that it 's an action movie based on the lowest common denominator . it 's super-stylized and sleek and has some pretty big sequences but that 's it . some action films like die hard inexplicably hold up on repeated viewings . here , after the first watch , you 've probably experienced all you 're going to see . they add in the daughter subplot which is n't as developed as it should be but it did resonate with me . the film does have its fan but it 's hard for me to like something so .... plastic . should you buy it ? i doubt it , unless you want a show-off disc for your home theatre , something that other films do infinitely better
i have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner 's music class , and i will call it art . people will write many reviews about the music , and they will say it is wonderful , and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages . they will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks . music is not suppossed to hurt the ears . to call this good music is an insult to good musicians . i will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer , for clearly they were higher than a kite , no , make that a weather ballon , when they composed the album . creative ; maybe . listenable , enjoyable , humable , playable when company is over ; no
this record blowz . the tunes last forever -- one verse after another , same crap melody over and over , no drama , no nothing except the old ennui , which i guess is what appeals to some folks . and lenny could n't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes . he 's improved somewhat over the years , but you all really need too look up from your `` fleurs de mal '' once in awhile . poetry is poetry , music is music , and while leonard 's poetry may speak to you , his music sucks
my wife introduced my to tift merritt 's music when we were dating ... so i 've got a soft spot for tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album , tambourine . i 'm disapointed . there 's not mush to this album . it 's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album . bramble rose is much , much more interesting
this was joe walsh in his prime , when he was really rockin' if your a james gang fan , and you like live music , you really should own this `` cd '' ! ( joe at some of his best ! ! ! )
awesome album . i bought it for `` believe '' but there is not a bad song on the cd . nice suprise of the song `` building bridges '' . i was thinking to myself that sounds like sheryl crow , then looked in the liner notes and it was . good harmony with her and vince gil .
this was my first bertrice small book and i have to say i was not impressed . i did not care for the character at all . she was spoiled , and self rightous to everyone , including her family . i also thought the book was extremely boring . there was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action . it took me forever to get through this book and i am a very fast reader . this book made me not want to read any of her other books because i am afraid that they will be just as bad . i hope this was a one time oops for ms. small because this book was not good at all
we got jason in space and we get pinhead in space . this is pure nonsense . words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels : when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people , it 's time to stop making these movies !
please do not compare this with clock work orange . it 's shame . this movie is shame on director . cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good . this movie is like b grade stuff . plot is good , but not the direction or screen play
i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion . while it was unique , it was too hard to get into . i also really hated the story , it was also too confusing to follow , to strange to enjoy , and to boring to care . i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read . the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club . the reivews , by the way , in the club were 50/50 . some loved it , the rest of us hated it . there was no in-between . i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors , i 'm not sure who else would like it
the title of this cd threw me off ; the description and the first review did n't help either . the primary reason for buying this cd was the song `` you are my sister '' , but this version is a duet with someone that ca n't sing . i ca n't tell which cd has a version of the song as seen on letterman . disappointing
in the early <NUM> 's rolling stone magazine did a piece on roy buchanan , the late , and great , guitarist . roy once turned down an offer to play with the stones . ry cooder was nearby , overheard the interview , and began a rant about the stones and mick jagger in particular . ry was quoted saying , as i recall , that , though keith did n't attend the `` jamming with edward '' session , the tape was rolling . ( if memory serves , ry said that keith left the session , supposedly , according to ry , in order not to appear to be riff hunting . ) ry said the stones `` stole '' his sound and riffs . he said `` honky tonk woman '' was an example of this `` ripoff . '' in my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely ry 's style . ry also was disdainful of mick 's so called `` devil '' persona . he thought it absurd that a twerp ( my word but i think i 'm accurately depicting ry 's attitude towards mick ) like mick could be considered `` satanic . '' later , when ry 's disgust became evident to mick and he prepared to fly back to the states , ry said mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money . i think ry wanted less bs from mick and company .
this book stinks on ice . no offense of corse . this is not one of nb 's best books . i read ten pages and then i knew the ending . a boy goes on top of a volcano to find a monster . it turns out the monster is , well i wo n't give the ending away . stick to your harry potters and artimis fowl . i really advise you not to by this book . please do n't . i am not sure if you will but if you do buy it , it will be in the garbage can in two days or les
i realize historical accuracy was not the intent of the filmmakers here , but as a history teacher , i feel the need to beg you to tell your children that this is not the way jamestown really went down . an unreal number of students enter high school believing that this film is a historical documentary , and the first step to teaching jamestown is to convince the students otherwise . perhaps good can come from this film , in that it can teach young people to be critical of secondary sources
i read this book , aafter i had seen the movie several times and i must say , elizabeth levy left out alot of the romance and other things . but she did put a different view on things . i would give it <NUM> 1/2 stars , but i ca n't
steve perry came thru good , but the instrumentation was lousy , and this is remastered ! pfoohey ! my vynyl is better . i want my money back . do n't think i 'll buy legacy products again
* * * * this review is not for the superbit version * * * * * the <NUM> star rating is not for the movie , but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen ; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail , it says on the movie case its widescreen , yet its full screen , not much you can do . can someone at amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on ? it would help out
... particularly one who falsely refers to himself as a prince and who produces trash like this . when doves cry is an unashamed rip off of mc hammer 's excellent pray and the title track is far too long for my liking . save your money .
i have been a big fan of mr. woods since `` white cargo . '' his books are not great literature , but fun reads with interesting characters and the outcomes are never obvious . this book fail in that i was not able to relate to the characters , too much sex with nothing to do with the story ( i am not against sex but it should be relevant , not sensationalistic ) . well , you cant hit one out of the park every time . if you like woods still of writing and storytelling you need to check out the cult favorite `` tourist in the yucatan '' cool thriller
not good at all ! ! ! ! while watching the movie i thought it sounded like a great soundtrack ... but i think they must have put all the bad songs on i
do not waste your money on any cd 's or dvd 's john fogerty has made.premonition is by far the most excellent of all his dvd's.there will never be another one to take it 's place.have it love it.nothing i ever bought in dvd 's '' by john fogerty will compare to premonition.i give it a <NUM> plus
i enjoy reading , but i am a very visual person and was disappointed in this book because while it offers suggestions that make sense , it takes longer to get through the book since it is practically all words and very few pictures for inspiration
( ... ) this cd is sub-par . most of the beats are cool , but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics
this collection consists mostly of the last stories in the past through tomorrow . ptt may well be one of heinein 's masterworks , a collection of short stories that retells history from the late <NUM> 's but puts the world on a different course . by lopping off the last few short stories , this collection looses the continuity that made the ptt a great read . .
i like a little bit of it , doesent mean its good , i wont throw it away or anything , ill just let it sift ... wait ... and look at the album cover most of the time . slayer is getting better though
this item is billed as `` the best of `` shatner and nimoy .. now i really do have to wonder about the use of the word '' best '' here ... neither shatner nor spock can sing , so this album exists as a goof ... but there really is n't anything funny about the material contained on this disc ... indeed , since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously , the sides on this album were never intended as joke material .. the fact that they have become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides , by either of these two actors , were ever recorded ... now i like a good joke when i hear one , as well as the next guy , and i appreciate comic tunes , but the dull , tedious , often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains ... getting back to the use of the word '' best '' as a descrition of what is contained on this album ... if this stuff is the '' best '' that either man is capable of i can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like ... '' best '' ... as in the '' best '' manure the cow has to offer ? .. as in it 's `` best '' to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes ? or maybe `` best '' as in it would be `` best '' to avoid wasting your hard-earned money on this flapdoodle .... that is a use of the word `` best '' that is appropriate ....
a relentlessly trendoid pastiche intended for the north american kewl market . it cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists , but the association implies that there is a `` new thing '' here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia , which is n't the case . rather being something new , it is an example of unassimilated influences . some north american influences have been `` eaten , '' perhaps especially by artists connected with bahia , but that 's not really on the table here . virginia rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply ca n't move her butt stylistically - thus , her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony . brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge
i was n't impressed by this film . first of all , i could never `` buy '' that saskia reeves and clive owen were a brother and sister . nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related . nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship . they might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems , because that 's how the relationship came across . personally , outside of the button-pushing topic of incest , i found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry . clive owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent lawrence harvey , and saskia reeves was simply annoying ( like her character , a weak , hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man . ) the only actors who showed any real feeling were alan rickman as the husband , and karl johnson as clive owen 's aids-stricken boss . karl johnson has the best scene in the film : he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair , obviously suffering from aids , and this very fact intimidates the guy he 's gone to meet . the man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the karl johnson character , and in the end karl johnson seizes the guy 's sandwich and bites it , then offers the other guy a bite , pushing the sandwich into his face , basically ... it 's a scene that crackles with his anger & pain at being trapped by this illness , which is going to kill him , while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally . but aside from that wake-up call , the film dragged , and by the time clive owen 's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he 's been used by his `` sister '' to inflate her sense of self-importance , i was long gone , with my head nodding . much ado about nothing , frankly . one star for the soundtrack ; one star for the performances of alan rickman ( what little he has to work with , he shines ) and karl johnson . die-hard clive owen fans such as myself ; eeeh , pass on this .
this is supposed to be entertainment ? well , wait ... yeah , it is ... comedy ! what a joke to think anyone with half a budweiser soaked brain thinks this guy has an ounce of talent ... people that like this stuff probably are the same people who like tim mcgraw , toby keith and the like ... if you ask them & quot ; who has more talent , the eagles or kenny chesney ? & quot ; their likely answer would be the latter ... what are they putting in that there budweiser lately ? must be some kinda mind numbing stuff to make people think this waste of space- poor excuse for a human being and even sorrier excuse for a musician could even stand in the same room with a legend like the eagles or fleetwood mac ... it 's really sad to see the music industry fall to this low a level ... speaking of fleetwood mac , has anyone heard the awful rendition of & quot ; landslide & quot ; by the dixie chicks ? sounds like someone scratching the chalkboard to me ... check out the original , and judge yourself ... if you know what talent is when you hear it ..
i luv fall out boy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awl songs get <NUM> outta <NUM> ! ! ! ! ! ! deservs all <NUM> starss ! ! !
the <NUM> second spot is dead . the <NUM> second spot is dead ! the <NUM> second spot is dead ! alright , i get it already . at least i did after the first <NUM> pages or so . unfortunately this book does not end at <NUM> pages . never have so many words been used to say so little . the first third of this book ( plus one chapter online ) ( parenthesis meant as a tribute to jaffe ) tells you why the <NUM> second spot is dead . to illustrate the demise of the <NUM> second spot , jaffe uses a dead horse and beats it repeatedly . perhaps jaffe is quite funny and clever at a party , but his schtick gets a little old when trudging through <NUM> pages of his quips ( plus one chapter online ) . jaffe fashions himself as a modern day don rickles , passing out insults to everything and everybody who uses a <NUM> second spot . unfortunately , this increases the page count of the book by about <NUM> pages . the final two-thirds of the book is a survey of everything you can use instead of the <NUM> second spot . jaffe says you have <NUM> options and he has designed <NUM> little logos for each of them ( which you can see on his website ) ( again parenthesis meant as a salute to jaffe ) . this is not any ground breaking information . if you have been paying attention and made occasional contact with society , you will have realized that you can use the internet as a marketing tool . mostly , jaffe 's observations are re-hashes of stuff you can find in a trade journal or two . and because this is an adweek book , i suspect most of this stuff was available in an adweek article . the important thing about this survey portion of the book is that it gives you very little insight on how to use these tools more effectively . it 's just jaffe telling you that you are ignorant if you are not using his <NUM> alternatives to the <NUM> second spot . save yourself $ <NUM> and get a subscription to adweek instead
so many of these bands sound the same i think they should all just have the same name . how about the sell outs , or perhaps the posers or maybe the pretenders ( oops that one is taken by a good band already ) . that way , no one would have to pretend they have just discovered the one new band that does n't really sound like the rest and is n't in it just for the quick money and quick fame . c'mon folks . get real . these guys are just another nu metal band that wo n't be around in a year or two and i along with legions of others ca n't wait till this genre of music is gone and dead like disco . temporary amusement for party background music while you talk with your pre high school friends and tell each other how cool this `` new '' band is , maybe . quality rock music with soul , talent and heart , hardly
big disappointment . i expected this book to be hysterical . her sense of humor is certainly different ! very shallow material . marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
i did not expect a primer on indian music . i expectd , instead examples of songs in different styles . this cd does do that to a limited extent , but ravi shankar spends too much time instructing the audience . the music that is presented seems rough and un rehearse
i have been reading this book for a graduate level art education course . in this book kochman makes many broad generalizations that , while he may consider them true , are belied by the way he phrases them . he makes many absolute statements about the behaviors of both black people and white people and the way in which he writes leaves no room for deviation . i would recommend this book if you are curious about why racism is still a problem in this country . the problem of racism will only begin to be alleviated when people stop making broad statements that stereotype races or cultures as behaving in a particular way . kochman does not seem to realize this
we all have different taste and i am trying to consider this . but to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life . nickelodeon and even the disney channel featuring him . my little girl and i listened to two songs that they played on the disney channel over and over.malti is the song she really started to listen to . honestly . the only reason why that song is so great is barbara 's voice and singing ability . dave ca n't sing and should n't even try to sing in spanish . the tune is catchy and we find us humming along . so i ordered this cd . what a joke . most of the time you ca n't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs . he has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it . but it is not entertaining for little ones.my daughter keeps asking : what is this ? till malti comes on and then she and i are relieved and hum along with joy and glee . thank you barbara for saving this song . i even bought another cd thinking perhaps i just got a bad one and the next are better . i am disappointed with that one as well . so you take a song like somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it . wopee . i like it but it is n't worth it to me and i admit i have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly .. he is overrated and sold . there is a song with cheryl crow on it . okay . so i am thinking this will be fun perhaps . only to find that i want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song . i guess i am not a alternative and do n't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music . i want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children . this type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time . my children have no clue what this is about and ca n't figure it out . and we listen to everything from disney to classic , to broadway . you name it . so we are not just sesame street cd lovers . but this music is a joke . no talent . one tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing . barbar saves this cd but what a waste of money for one song . don '' t buy it . and all these people who fall for it .. grrrr . it is like a art gallerie . everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot . and they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is . and in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it . give me a break . shame on disney and nickelodeon to fall into this as well . and taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity . wow , guess you can tell i am not into it . ; <NUM> ( explore , again .. everyone has different taste . but i just do n't get it , nor like it . i find it horrible .
as if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough . a f * * * 'in grease video ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ja officially became a diva with this album . this album is horrible . the pledge had some life due to nas appearance , thats why it 's hard for me to request a zero star rating . bottomline if ja 's body was made up of his albums , this part would gangrene , maggots would avoid this and you should too
i do n't know what to say about this book . it is the single worst book i have ever read in my young life . i feel like i 've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it . i would say at some point in the book , maybe about halfway , every line of dialogue , every characterization , every plot point , is absolutely terrible . this book is truly an offense to literacy , and i can not understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash . i can only imagine that robin cook either allowed a child to write this book , or was chronically drunk while writing it . either that or he has lost his faculties altogether . i have read children 's essays that have been better written . while it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book , the highlights are : -knowing the mystery <NUM> pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like , `` i going to get to the bottom of this mystery '' and when the character 's discover something , giving each other high-fives . -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions , own guns , and play basketball . -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny . -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros , nyc coroners , fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body . ( also paying for their friends to come too ) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working , and asking questions , and getting answers to them real easy . -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes . ( i.e . making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them ) -the book spirals into total madness in the last <NUM> pages to a beyond implausible ending . i got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it . if anyone thinks this book is better than two stars , they need their head examined .
my <NUM> year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with . i think it is best for those with a dance background . the music is good , though
harry connick , jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie , but nonetheless , this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture . if you are purchasing this cd because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends , as i do , then i do not recommend this cd ; instead i would buy the originals
first of all , let me say that i think billy klippert should have been the canadian idol . buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way . now , objectively speaking , i do believe ryan malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range , but at times ryan is stretching it in this album . i believe most of the songs sound the same , and truly there is just not enough variety on this album , at times i feel like im listening to elevator music . i think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better . now i do think his release single & quot ; something more & quot ; is catchy , nice hooks and sentimental lyrics , but unfortunately its the only gem on this album . buy the single and forget the album . i believe canadian idol fans should give billy 's new album a try , you wont be disappointed ! ! ! ! !
note that in my previous review , in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer , i was only referring to the & quot ; that touch of mink & quot ; dvd . the father goose dvd is not that bad
when i was <NUM> and first discovering guitar , i loved this album . listening to it now , it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.vai is technically very impressive , but the man ca n't write a decent song to save his life . vai 's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians , lay down a generic rhythm track , and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album . technique on your instrument is never a bad thing , however , technique should be just a means to an end , not the end itself . and that 's what no shred guitarist seems to understand . the fact that shred guitarists like vai are n't more popular is due to one thing : they 're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs . there 's a good reason why non-guitarists hate this stuff . basically , once you get past the `` gee , that 's neat '' factor , this album , and nearly all of vai 's music , feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.to be blunt , this is what john tesh or yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards . not only that , his guitar tone is absolutely awful . very thin , high pitched , and brittle sounding . the best thing on here is the blatant van halen rip-off `` the audience is listening '' : the rest is just masturbation . vai 's best work has always been as a sideman , especially the stuff he did with david lee roth , because then he 's forced to play actual songs , rather than <NUM> minute long , tedious guitar solos . on his own , he 's just unbearable . i considered giving this one star , but i gave it <NUM> stars due to the fact that vai can play , it 's just what he 's playing that 's the problem .
this book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but ... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either a technical guide ( see wasserman and faust ) or a sociological simplification
after romero 's & quot ; dead -- movies & quot ; as well as & quot ; dead alive & quot ; and & quot ; bad taste & quot ; this movie is rotten.no real plot , and no characters with any depth.the director calls it art.this is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it 's really good.we are told that there are <NUM> deaths , but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.comic books do better than this.i guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.the most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman 's mouth.this mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.italians seem to do better with crappy gore than germans
i bought this cd for my son - we are searching for good r & amp ; b / rap with a positive message - we were very disappointed in this cd - the recording quality was lacking , the beats very repetitive and uninspiring , you could hardly hear the words - overall - we are listing this cd for sale and we just bought it yesterday ! my husband , son and i all agreed within ten minutes that this cd was not a winner
i have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery . i thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light ' plots . there are serious themes here - murder , death , kidnapping , and others . too bad the authors did n't focus more on the light plotlines that reader 's look for in these books - maggie 's romance ( this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer ) and the jamie / max story ( which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline ) . i also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her .
sorry , this cd just is n't all that and i went and bought it based on the fact that i love book of shadows and read the reviews . bls earlier stuff is awesome , and i 'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so i thought i 'd like this . i do n't , it does n't work . zakk 's singing on this just pushes me away , or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be bob seger - which imo is not a good thing . get book of shadows , which is excellent , or if you want other mellow metal from zakk - hangover music vol <NUM> blows this one away too .
when you mix soft core porn and culturly confused cubans , you get this piece of crap literature . i think their must have been at least <NUM> different sex or sex related scenes and oh so many other odd things . one example is when one of the characters ( a girl ) masturbates to her mother 's old boyfriend 's picture , imagining him going down on her ... uck ! the plot is so badly intwined and mixed together you want to question ever reading again ! for the sake of literature do n't read this !
i 'm scared to death of aliens , and i love nothing more than a good campfire tale , so i was so excited when i found this book . i expected it to be a collection of great , creepy , true-sounding stories , kind of like urban legends , that you could tell to a group of friends to keep them up at night . boy , was i wrong . it 's just a collection of short stories about aliens . most of them are more sci-fi like than scary . i was expecting stories of the traditional `` alien encounter '' type , but that 's not what 's in here . they 're not horribly written , just not really what the book promises . the shape of the book is great , though . it 's got a sturdy cover , and it 's made sort of like a field guide . if it did contain creepy tales to tell around the campfire , it would be perfect to stuff in your backpack . too bad .
plot : slash gets mad at axle and goes on a murderous killing spree . then he does some pretty intense guitar solos . solos:5 star acting:1 star recommened : anything with burt renold
i was so disappointed by this book i could not get through more than a couple of chapters . the author may know about mountaineering , but he seems to know very little about kenya . moreover , i found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring
much has been made here about the remixes on this collection . the truth is that the audio problems go far beyond the remixed titles . the whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out , muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at sony/columbia did n't catch it before release . this compilation is about <NUM> years overdue for a serious remaster . some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the sundazed releases , however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues . they are still by far the lesser of two evils . at least the songs punch the way the raiders need to punch . as is , the `` legend '' cd sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust . it 's far to painful to listen to
i have to agree with greg ippolito 's review . the album is simply incomplete without dirk diggler 's `` you got the touch . '' the most significant musical moment in the film . hard to believe it 's not on volume <NUM> either . a shame
i can not believe that i paid so much for such a horrible movie . i thought i was buying the cream of the crop and i ended up with this . after <NUM> minutes i could n't stand it anymore . i 've never seen a movie so stilled . it seemed as though the scenery was all plastic . i rated it <NUM> star , if i could , i would not have given it a rating at all . the movie starring daniel- day lewis was a much better version . actually there is n't any comparision between the two
first off , kanye west is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes . he looks plain , sounds plain , and if it was n't for the controversy that surrounds him , everyone would be like `` who cares ? '' but while he sings about jesus and lives like he is a prophet , there is no substance to him and his music . lame beats , hypocritical lyrics , this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today . his interviews show him as arrogant , racist , and unlovable , but it is selling his music and that 's what he cares about . so while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm , he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy ( and their own hypocrisy ) . so let 's be real for a second , because i am about to give you the best cd you will hear in years - it 's a mixture of rap and rock , with ( real ! ) beats , acoustic guitar , splashes of piano , and a voice that can sound like chris martin of coldplay one second and then rap like ll cool j the next ... buy today mat kearney 's `` nothing left to lose . '' the best cd of <NUM> and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself
unfortunately this sequel to the amazing cult classic does n't stack up to the original at all . despite the disappointing movie i was very pleased with the dvd itself . it comes in a well packaged case and there are plenty of extras on the dvd to keep you busy . the product itself was very good , i wish i could say the same for the movie
the music in this cd is beautiful , the lyrics are lovely as well . the fact that i do n't like michael crawfords ' voice might have something to do with this ... gerard butler was the first phantom i heard .... so i hold my standards to him . michael crawfords ' voice is nice , i 'll admit , but give me gerry any day . perhaps michael did have a voice suited for the role , and perhaps gerard butler did n't , but i 'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones , and baritone voices to tenor voices . sarah has a lovely voice , but in my opinion , it is a bit too mature for the part of a <NUM> year old girl . but do n't let this stop you-buy this cd ... you may love it , you may hate it . just compare michael 's voice to gerard 's voice ... the difference is rather laughable
well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book written on <NUM> , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so
sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song i did n't like -- until now . i bought this new release expecting to love it all , with one or two epics like euphoria , sister nightfall , or lithium and a lover . what did i get instead ? -- <NUM> minutes of pop radio . gone is the violin , and rare is morten 's voice . we get a bunch of monika ( who has a solid voice , but every song sounded the same ) . please , morten , tell us this is an early april fool 's joke and that the real release is coming out april <NUM> .
if you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and <NUM> 's production quality , than this cd is for you . other than that , you have to ask yourself why it was $ <NUM> at walmart as stated by a previous review . ( hint : not because it was a hidden gem ) i could n't give this less than a star because of the song selection . that is all this cd has going for it . so read the songs , enjoy it for what it is worth , move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this . ( all in that order ) sorry drew , now go back to the drawing board
my father , my friend mandy and i watched this movie last night . we were all very disappointed . we thought the movie was n't realistic . we watched the news and saw all the firefighters and police officers running into the buildings trying to help the people . in this `` movie '' we saw them leisurely walking around , even stopping to have nice conversations with each other about what they thought was happening . we were really disappointed with the search scene . it made the men and women of our country look like quitters because it was getting dark . we were under the impression that they search through the night . at least that 's what we saw on the news . guess we were wrong . all together i would have to say i 'm glad i borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting my money buying or renting it
while surfing the channels one night , i happen to stumble upon mind of mencia . i attempted to get into the show , and actually watched a few episodes , but barely got more then a slight chuckle . i usually love comedy central , but this effort by ned `` carlos mencia '' holness simply is n't funny . i 'm not going to go into detail about how he 's really honduran/german and not mexican , or that he 's been accused by several other comedians of stealing material , i 'll simply comment on what i saw . and what i saw simply lacked comedic value . he 's often compared to dave chappelle , but dave chappelle 's racial remarks are made in a very smart , interesting , and often unique manner , and chappelle show did n't need to be racist to be funny ( like the rick james skit ) mind of mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into : white people do _________ , while mexicans do _________ . its just not funny
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of martha . martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck . even the film credits include the nickname ` dumptruck ' besides the character 's surname ( evidently feeling the need to labour the point ) . portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given , she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student . later , when the cult status of the ` suicides ' ( that is , murdered students ) becomes apparent , martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic . but her attempt is shown as a failure . at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled , in an electric wheelchair . ryder 's character , having finished her voyage of self-realisation , rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn . martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun . the image of martha in her wheelchair , an object of pity for ryder and for the audience , signifies to us fears of being different , of not being beautiful , of not being loved and respected . martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming . she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker . and though some of us in the audience may be fat , or disabled , or both , we may yet still fear martha , and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own , even is in physical and social reality , we are more like martha . for this reason , ` heathers ' fails as an exploration of the ` hell ' of high school ( a description often used by buffy/angel/ firefly 's joss whedon ) . those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ` beauty ' as the protagonists ( probably the majority of us ) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow , leaving a bitter after-taste . the way ` fat ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable , transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers . sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' ( to quote paul campos ) - and even at best it is lazy film-making .
it reminds me of uthanizm . i did not like it . theres no hard songs . i 'm a die hard lynch fan . if i your not down with uthanizm do n't buy it . its a dissapointment . i think
the beginning held my attention well enough , but about halfway through the book i gave up and skipped to the end . excellent characters and interesting research , but fiammetta and bucino drown in a web of plot lines . more like a few episodes of a tv show than a movie .
this book is not a book for minors and no where on this book is a warning as it deals with sex magic , bdsm and drugs and even states , `` there is nothing wrong with using mind altering drugs . '' the author sold this book to a young minor without verification of age and without parental permission
i got ta say i used to love this album back in the late <NUM> 's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really is n't as good as i remembered . . .they are quite loose , the songs do n't stand the test of time , the playing not nearly as great as i remember it to be . . . surprisingly rough on groove . . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa
the illustrations in this book , an artful combination of digital realistic media and traditional pen and ink are brought together in splashes of color and images that delight the imagination . however , fantastic illustrations alone can not make up for a story line that lacks creativity and warmth . an almost robotic tone takes the reader through a day in the life of our mischievous protagonist whose actions , such as `` showing joey whipple my underpants '' and setting shoes on fire using the sun and a magnifying glass go a step beyond acceptable childish pranks . the story ends abruptly without closure and without endearing the characters which leaves the reader wondering `` what is the point ? ''
before you even consider buying this book , take a few seconds to try this instructive little exercise : type `` feed onions cats '' ( without the quotation marks ) into your browser 's search field , and see what comes up . onions are toxic to cats . cats are obligate carnivores , and many common plant compounds that humans ingest daily are actually poisonous to them . i wish that there were some way to get this book out of amazon.com 's database . many thanks to cat rescuer ( see below ) for being the first to spot this unbelievable incompetence and warn unsuspecting cat owners away from this `` cookbook '' . this review is largely a repetition of what cat rescuer has already said ; i just added this one on to knock a star of the book 's rating . please feel free to do the same
i terribly disappointed by this movie . it bears some resemblance to the bone collector and silence of the lamb , but has none of the suspense , mystery , good acting and good story that these other movies have . this lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end . the cops were basically two idiots who could n't solve the crime on their own . add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie .
i never , and i repeat : never walk out on a movie , but when this garbage came out in the theater i was out the door in <NUM> minutes or less , i was glad my tickets were for free . however , my time was not . it was so stupid and totally off-balance that i have made it personal mission to validate how bad this movie is.if gangster movies is your thing please watch `` the untouchables '' or something equally cool . still have it on my list as the top <NUM> `` so bad that it is bad '' movies of all time . some movies get the coveted `` so bad that is good '' title ... this is not one of them . garbage .
since i am a patent attorney specializing in computer-related inventions by trade , as well as an avid photographer , i consider myself extremely well-versed in computer technology and digital photography . i have been using digital cameras and photoshop for years . suffice it to say that i am not in any way , shape or form a `` beginner . '' i bought this book in order to learn advanced tips , secrets and techniques that would allow me to improve and streamline my workflow while processing my images using photoshop cs . however , this book is poorly written in the extreme . it seems that almost every other sentence refers to a step , process , function or photoshop menu item that the author fails to adequately explain , thereby leaving the reader with more questions than answers . every few weeks or so i keep trying to plow through another section or chapter in the hope that the descriptions and examples will get better . but it never does . i have yet to finish a single section of the book and think to myself , `` okay , now i understand this particular concept . '' most often i am left clicking around photoshop menus and searching for options in dialogue boxes trying in vain and with much frustration to find and use some function that the author says should be used but failed to explain or show . most often , the author does not bother to give any examples of what he means when he says you should use some function or process buried behind <NUM> or <NUM> levels photoshop menus . this has turned out to be a complete waste of time and money
would n't you think with the title of the collection being `` when the sun goes down '' that it would actually include the video to the song `` when the sun goes down '' ? apparently not ! the only reason i ordered this dvd was for the video/song titled the same as the collection and it 's not even there .
all `` style '' and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta & uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the `` entertainer '' please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .
great casting , but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film . it 's so aggravating . i want to chew my own leg off half way into it . i know part of it is everyone is a `` talker '' of a various sort . they 're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell . i just do n't think it works . otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived . the best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves . it gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name . mamet 's an extraordinary genius-writer , but this did not belong on the screen .
there is a preview in box set # <NUM> , in which he makes a commercial like that of brokeback mountain in which he says the final <NUM> episodes on dvd in set <NUM> .. shame on you mr. judge .. only <NUM> episodes out of about 200+ are getting the dvd digital cut ? in the words of your own created characters .. you suck ! ! rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite fart-knocker mike judge limiting his release of titles .. mike judge the ultimate tool .. huh huh , he said tool
they could n't let children sing about the `` pelvic thrust '' and had to change lyrics , so what 's the point of doing the time warp again ! ; d and that awful cover of ghostbusters makes me hurl ! :
this is a fascinating concept , and a marketable one as well , in light of america 's current infatuation with the edifice complex . considering the author 's scholarly credentials , sex and real estate should have been a absorbing book . & quot ; should have & quot ; is the pivotal phrase here . no question that garber 's body of knowledge is vast -- she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis . maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader . while i have no doubt but that this fact is true , the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble . anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed
if you 're into classical music , you know how different the same symphony performed by two different conductors and orchestras can sound . same here . if you really love this score like i do , i think you 'll be disappointed in the difference in sound compared to the original . i 'd give this a higher rating if it was the only version available . but since the original is available on cd , there 's no reason to buy this imposter . there 's only <NUM> minutes more from lion in winter , and the mini-mary score is nothing special
my alarm clock is set at 3:40 . superhero underwear is cool . cd drives blink . i got a concussion from the fire alarm . puppies will conquer the world . wonder woman would beat up superman . u r the coolest person in the world . thank you for looking at this useless revie
i 'd be hard pressed to find one funny skit -- no , one funny moment at all -- in this dvd set . mencia 's drivel pretty much reminds me of a lot of david letterman 's `` top ten '' lists ; anyone above the age of thirteen could have thought any of this up . it 's actually mind numbing how bad some of these jokes are . i 'm not bashing -- i 'm warning . comedy central is advertising this as sort of a replacement for the ( much ) superior chapelle 's show . viewer , do not be fooled . carlos mencia is the most boring man on television . but i 'll give him this ; if he came out with this material in the early 1990s , it may have passed . but , like `` mama jokes '' , this humor has long dried up . 0/1
my inability to see what 's so great about this album does not stem from my lack of experience with `` experimental '' or `` electronic '' music . nor does it reflect my feeling about bands that change their sound on every album . the problem with this album is that it lacks what ulver are ordinarily pretty good at . when they explored the folky territory of kveldssanger , the raw black metal of nattens madrigal , and even the ambitious and remarkably diverse william blake album , they slipped more effortlessly into the style . a few `` soundscape '' albums , and a couple more blippy ep 's later , they come up with this mess . and i say mess , because that 's really what it sounds like to me . it 's as though they wanted to hang onto some of the elements of `` quick fix for melancholy '' but incorporate the experimental weirdness of label mate when ( yes , that 's the name of the band : when ) , almost to a worshipful extent at times . unfortunately the result is n't nearly as brilliant , in my opinion , to the aforementioned solo project . rather it sounds like a bit of a monstrosity that 's been shined up a bit by garm 's silky crooning ( the silkiness of which gets on my nerves after a short while ) . of course , this is my opinion . i do n't ordinarily find it necessary to write bad reviews like this , but when i see something like this that is n't really all that unique or amazing get a lot of praise , it rubs me the wrong way .
this cd is so boring . sarah mclachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion , her intensity , her hurt , etc ... these are very tired renditions of all-too-familiar christmas songs . sure , i can stomach a kenny rogers christmas , for some reason it just seems to make sense . but sarah mclachlan putting out a christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks . excuse my frankness , but this album is very disappointing
do not buy this book unless you are being retested on the old pmp or capm exam . this book is based on the 2nd edition ( <NUM> ) of the pmbok and is therefore obsolete . the current exams use the 3rd edition ( <NUM> ) of the pmbok . much has changed so this book will mislead you and you will answer exams questions incorrectly . the processes , process groups , some definition have changed . as a result , many of his test questions will be wrong also . i am a pmp and i teach pmp and capm test prep sessions
horrible , boring film from one of my top <NUM> favorite directors . the only thing worth seeing is the amazing & quot ; tiara & quot ; of candles that goya ( supposedly ? ) uses to paint at night . boring !
the many reviews i have read of `` the merchant of venice '' make me thirst nearly unbearably to purchase this dvd . however , i can not , for it offers no english subtitles , which i need to get the most out of a movie . especially shakespeare , whose language is difficult enough to begin with . i have `` much ado about nothing '' which i adore & which does have subtitles . will look for others
this cd is n't too bad but at the same time i wish i had n't bought it . i think the singer said to himself `` let 's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally '' . ( and in a realllly bad way ) oddly enough , the absolute best song these guys ever put out is n't featured on either of their cd 's . ( sweet summer ) besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song , it 's nothing like the first cd . nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of do n't stop on this cd . just kinda bland soft rock . i recommend downloading sweet summer as it is their best song by far and perhaps possibly buying the first cd , but do n't waste your time on this one
jewel is on crack . what the hell is this ? ! ? `` women who suck their cigarettes as though they were giving their hatred head '' what .... ?
i purchased this dvd assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas . the focus is on the abs , where the back comes into play . but there are no exercises designed just to targot the back . in fact , michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form . a good cardio workout , alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn . a good abs and waist workout as well . there are alot of twisting moves . the exercises are very similar to tae-bo , and i would recommend a tae-bo video over this one . michael only performs half of the exercises himself . he also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention . i would n't go through this workout though , and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience . he also uses handweights , a jump-rope , and a body bar during the workout . but its easy to manage without them .
sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but i was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book . maybe i should have expected such based on the title , but i found it unsettling nonetheless
this book lacks technical details . this book talks too much about planning and management . i would rather have a book with more step by step instructions on how to accomplish different tasks . this book talks more what exchange can do and less on how to do it
i have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it was n't the same movie i have . this movie in no way represents the life of la cosa nostra . there are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic . it 's present day and the guys are & quot ; running numbers & quot ; . hello , ever hear of the lottery . they start up a & quot ; bookie buisness & quot ; . besides calling it a bookie buisness , which is just plain retarded , how are <NUM> nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster . then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him . i guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over . then again that might have been a good thing . the acting was terrible except for the late ray serra and joe d'onofrio . even joe viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed tons of work . rent the hbo film gotti if you want to see what it 's really like . just to include wannabees and william demao in the same breath as goodfellas and the great living legend robert deniro is an insult . now demao is making & quot ; searching for bobby deniro & quot ; , he could only wish . the only reason i gave it a star is because i had to , they dont let you give it none
this was my first jance novel and probably my last . i am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book , men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable . many false assertions regarding the catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in new mexico as if it was a known fact . the most offensive reference being that god clearly must be a woman . do not buy from this author if morally conservative
nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst , and how dare him to diss krs-one , he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number <NUM> , he just added to why he sucks . lets face it , all his songs are basically dumb and and really don , t have much texture involved . and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable . if you buy this album , you throw away good money . unless you like bubblegum rap . this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool , but lets face it , its played out
i found out that there is n't any difference with adkins for life from the first book . disappointing , i tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results . however , i never support anything unless i have been convinced it truly does what it says and i found that with `` the average joes diet . '' a friend told me about it and i was always considered the fat girl . no longer ! and it 's stayed off .
ok so when i first started reading the book i thought all right this is ok. and the book went along and i still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book . then i finished the book and i realized something . nothing had happened really . there was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other . its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it , yeah because that is such a smart thing to do . this book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it . i do n't really understand why so many people love this book . this book is average at best and not much else .
i was looking for a book that had legends about orphans to which i might relate . this book only has <NUM> or <NUM> stories and i had already heard them in some form . i also thought there might be some therapeutic or life management benefit in listening to this book . however , the author merely lists the `` gifts '' ( personality tendencies ) and describes the emotions of abandoned children , but does little by way of giving ideas for healing oneself or dealing with the ongoing relationships between our relatives and others . the content and gentle delivery might be helpful to those still grieving or those still trying to put their feelings into words ; but , it does little for listeners at the next level seeking solutions or strategies
i was given this book by a friend with great taste in books , so i eagerly started it . after the first few chapters , i could not wait for it to end . the ultimate horror of this book is reserved for those compelled to finish any book they start . as has been mentioned in other reviews . we get it . the woods are `` scary '' and their presence is pervasive . the characters themselves , despite the author 's intent , are also wooden , and if the reader experiences any fear , it is the fear of being infected by the banality and possible mental retardation of heather price and her insufferable family . the best way to describe the story for me is this : it 's a fairy tale . its simplistic writing style and unsophisticated fear-factor could have very easily been told in <NUM> or <NUM> pages , and inserted invisibly into a volume of grimm 's . as such , it would have been a much better tale with at least the healthy moral about the hazards in spending too much time with your crazy aunt . as a novel , it is pure water torture . if the trees ever do revolt , useless wastes of paper such as this piece will most certainly be causative . i asked my friend about it after i finished . he admitted it was a joke ... a book he bought on a flight out to visit me , and in his words `` i was praying my plane would crash after the first <NUM> chapters . '' indeed
i enjoyed the movie claire of the moon , but when i read the book i found it to be a bit sophomoric . i am not a fan of `` cookie cutter '' type novels and she walks in beauty would definately fall into that catagory in my opinion . even if i had mounds of free time i would not spend much of it on this book , it 's an extreme let down .
we struggled through this - luckily we did n't pay to see it . ( my stepdaughter owns it , and lent it to me . ) a waste of time
these movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies . from a horror movie fan 's perspective , i remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original , `` it 's alive '' . the only thing about babies ( mutated or not ) that scares me is having to change their diapers ... it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too ! what a worthless ... waste
if you 're a fan of either `` holiday inn '' or `` white christmas '' you really , really should avoid this one . its recording quality not only offers substandard `` tin can '' sound , but you wo n't find rosemary clooney on a single track from white christmas . this is not a soundtrack . it 's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen . disappointing to say the least , as me and mine are avid fans of these christmas-themed films . the two stars i 've placed here are generous , but i could n't move down to one ... `` hate '' does n't fit . i am , however , not keeping this cd . too depressing and not at all what i hoped to hear . if you 're a true fan of the films , these recordings wo n't be what you hope to hear , either . good luck in finding the real thing !
the curse disc is perfect , i will say that but the gift can be used for the following things , other than listening purposes ... <NUM> . frisby <NUM> . mirror <NUM> . toilet paper <NUM> . shooting target <NUM> . tras
i agree with `` huntsmen '' . $ <NUM> for a bunch of dusty old doctor who eps ? no way . for that kind of money , i would want the entire series on dvd . you can get <NUM> years of tng for about that ? same for x-files
first things first : this compilation should n't even be called jermaine dupri presents ... because jd is only involved with two songs on here ( he stars in `` got ta getcha '' , and he produces one other song ) . anyway , i 'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together young , fly & flashy vol . <NUM> ; whether he was just thinking about `` the way we were '' , or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent . actually , maybe i should n't have said the latter , because it looks like jd dug up some of the most untalented people ever . but things are n't very inspiring with the known artists , like when j-kwon and daz try to save `` <NUM> toes '' . and i wonder how long ago that song was made because in it , j-kwon says he 's <NUM> , but that 's how old he was when `` tipsy '' came out . i do n't know why jd decided to dig up has-beens kp & envyi for the dismal `` put cha hands up '' ( that title even sounds like it came from <NUM> ) , and as for `` i think they like me '' , if it 's really dem franchize boyz ' song , how come they 're the only ones in there that ca n't rap ? most of the rappers on here are unknowns , but in the end they really are n't worth knowing because even jd is a better rapper than they are . miss b 's `` grown man '' suffers from a corny chorus , and t. waters ' `` throw 'd off '' is just plain wack . and cato 's lazy `` so what '' made me say just that . but the album 's nadir is the title track , performed by young capone , midnight , champagne shawty and c-dirt . not only is there lackluster production , but the guys ' rapping is so bad that they make chingy look like rakim . the only saving grace to this whole compilation is bun-b 's verse on the otherwise terrible `` kodak moment '' . unlike that title , though , this album is n't anything to remember . if jermaine ever makes a young , fly & flashy vol . <NUM> , i 'll be the first person not to get it . anthony ruper
i like grant green . i always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day . he deserves a true biography , rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why mr. green failed and died young . his career failed and he died young becauee of drugs -- -no one 's fault but his own .
well iv read through a few reviews now , some good , some totaly wierd and none understanding , some dont know what they ' v even on about but i read the review by g funkinn which i think is 3rd down . im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend . i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it 's easly one of my best if not my best , but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album ( someone love 's this album as much as me ) g funkinn you ' v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got .. .. .. i 'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album `` tear drops and closed caskets '' the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen , after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you ' v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it 's such a graphic song ) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable . you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie : im a g from cpt and other things that ryhme with g or e , but not in this song the song start 's by intruducing the <NUM> mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious . it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money , litle trigga 's heart broken by the fact he 's got no money and he want precious to be with him . so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money . they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto . in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher , after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out . 3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice , the song ends with the lyrics. `` small time dealing to selling keys , i cant believe the sh * * there telling me , they opened fire <NUM> bodys dropped so call the cops , precious little moe and trig , tear drops and closed caskets '' . the way the stories is told is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it . in the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment . the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying , too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking . after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words , if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac . what more can i say . if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets i actualy rate this <NUM> stars im not sure why it 's only put a <NUM> star rating ? ? ?
were is my boy prince man this really ticked me off he is only on one song first disc just another sucker then you dont hear him anymore maybe they were alking about us if your a prince fan dont buy this unless you collect his songs like i do cause just another sucker is all you get for a person that collects i dont have that one
conservatives will probably dislike it . liberals will find it a good , fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole . i 'm a liberal , so it was fun for me . but have you noticed how the word & quot ; community & quot ; is becoming the new flashword among liberals ? & quot ; we are all in this together , & quot ; says mario , so we had better take care of ourselves . like hillary clinton 's & quot ; it takes a village. & quot ; the use of & quot ; community & quot ; is like the use of & quot ; opportunity & quot ; by the conservatives . both are code words for points of view that , taken to their extremes , can be far more detrimental than helpful . americans ultimately prefer the middle . just remember that , folks , and no one will get hurt
i was forced to read this book in english class and it is terrible ! if you want a book that will put you to sleep at night , this is the one . i dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining !
nothing happens . nothing ! you watch for ... what <NUM> to <NUM> hours to discover the rediculus `` blue '' is just here to wipe out the earthlings because of overpopulation . big deal ! anyone who gives this thing a more than two do n't know what story telling is all about . soon as i can i 'm getting rid of this crap . you do n't want to be bored silly by a pointless story that goes nowhere do n't get this thing .
the book gemba-kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'kaizen ' already . it gives not much new information . the only new idea in the book is the attention given to the 'gemba ' , the place where the processes are performed . imai is right to stress the importance of the gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples to illustrate the gemba 's importance . however , only one nice idea is somewhat poor to fill a whole book . the major message of the book can be told just as well in an articel of no more then <NUM> pages
seeing a few of the unrealistically rave reviews of this flawed novel reminds me to remind everyone how tainted the amazon reader review process is . when anyone can review a book there 's the chance that the authors publicist , best friend , next-door-neighbor , and even mother can write a glowing review . i 'm always suspicious of `` best novel ever '' reviews ..
- its hard to be emphathetic towards a protagonist who 's depressed and decides to have an affair when she already has a great husband , two healthy children and no financial worries . two stars because the addition of the `` history of happiness '' ( research for a book she is writing ) was interesting .
remember the style of music that came out in the late <NUM> 's called punk ? the pioneers of this type of music were bands such a clash , the sex pistols , the ramones and the talking heads . the style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of the dead kennedies and ministry . even social distortion had their own little sound to offer . this is how it went through the <NUM> 's . yet , after the who nirvana-mania that saved music from whitesnake and warrent , punk , as well as many other sounds , seemed lost until ... green day comes around with `` dookie . '' this continued the punk sound into what we know today . so in the words of oasis : `` where did it all go wrong . '' it 's not that this sounds on it 's own is bad . when blink <NUM> first came out , they had a lot of fun to offer . but gawd , where do we draw the line ? after that , we had ( in no particular order ) sum <NUM> , new found glory , my chemical romance , showoff , and jeez , i could go on forever . they all sound so much alike . still they were once tolerable . but with simple plan , ( sigh ) , enough is enough . i ca n't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and bowling for soup . and i do n't easily confuse bands . really , though , these guy call themselves punk . but last time i checked , punk was about rebellion , anarchy , disatisfaction with where humanity is going , all that stuff . ex sex pistols `` anarchy in the uk '' or ramones `` i 'm against it . '' now listen to some of the titles off this : `` i 'm just a kid , '' `` god must hate me , '' `` i 'd do anything . '' difference ? you 'd have to be blind not to see one . these guys have jumped on the `` poser '' bandwagon that every other `` punk '' band on a major label has jumped on , and thus , mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy metal is
like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments , the singer 's voice , the melodies
i love trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions . it is effectively a vehicle for everyone 's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s , julia roberts , to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by nick nolte . nolte plays peter brackett , a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected chicago chronicle . ever the ladies man , brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts , his loyal readers , and even his grumpy editor . he manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time , every time ( even if it does mean plagiarising himself ! ) . having just released a novel , brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit , and life is looking good for this charming , yet slightly sleazy bachelor . this is of course until journalistic competition , in the form of the lovely sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) , comes along with her quick wit , sharpened pencil , keen nose for a story , and obligatory short skirt . in the end , this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably <NUM> minutes too late in arriving . the actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads , which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clichÈd one-liners . there are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story , some wide enough to fit julia roberts ' smile through sideways , and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios . if it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s , it failed miserably .
the color and cgi 's are excellent in this film . the location shots are great , and the attempt to capture the late <NUM> 's successful . however , the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude , language and appearance . while this might be the <NUM> 's , and women should be able to handle strong lead characters , this woman , who was the financial backer of the expedition , was disgusting . there have been several major cinematic attempts at this story , but this version leaves a lot to be desired
this is seriously the worst movie ever . the last time i saw it was in the theater , and i still ca n't get over how bad it was . in fact , it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy .... we did n't speak for six months after we saw it together ! i too wish i could give it no stars .... and obviously people are n't looking for this movie since the last review was in <NUM> ! i ca n't believe you can even buy it on dvd
the riftwar was a good saga . pug was good . tomas was good . arutha was good . everything was good . then feist came out with this series ... anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the atlantis attacks comic books by marvel , the eternals by jack kirby , and the fantastic # 337-340 and then you 'll easily see where feist stole this storyline from . a dreaming mad god that influences a world around him , that 's buried under a mountain , whose thoughts become reality ? /a dreaming black celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe ? c'mon , i ca n't believe i 'm the only who has seen this . everyone takes ideals from someone , hence tolkien syndrome , but to couple it with this sorry book ( ie a stupid book where a stupid pug that throws fireballs but ca n't dodge them and ca n't time travel like in other books and ca n't deal with a minor demon captain ) insults the people that made the dreaming celestial ( king kirby ) and the eternals . if he was gon na steal ideas , he should have made the entire book worthwhile . in this book , besides the old guard , erik is the only guy we really care about . characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we 're left with characters like miranda , whom we do n't reall any thing for at all . all in all , a very poor effort in the serpentwar saga . feist gets an a for stealing storylines and an f for originality . i 'll stick to newer guys like simon r green , aaron mccarty , and ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi .
if your main objective , is the study of human relationships , social rapports between humans , and conquering and seducing other people , this movie is for you . not an embarrassing movie , at all , for any of the actors . just , a nutty story , and enfatuation of the author of the script with people , relationships , seduction , etc . this is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant . not true . just that , perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others
following on from the fantastic 'the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release 'getting somewhere ' is a massive , massive disappointment . quite simply the material on 'getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless . on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'the duel ' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish , pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long , hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around . if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job . moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
anyone who buys this cd thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed . there 's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here . what you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying , seemingly based on random chords . the sort of stuff you do n't want to play for more than ten minutes . buyer beware
make a mix of michael 's first two solo albums ( michael schenker group and msg ) , add ufo 's & quot ; doctor doctor & quot ; and that 's the set list for this live album recorded in japan . so , the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not , because , if you already own hhis first two albums , this album is utterly superfluous . at least the line up is the same of msg : barden , michael , glen , raymond and powell , and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism
when i think of the sex pistols , i think the monkeys did it better as a boy band . let 's face it , dears , that is all the sex pistols were : a marketing ploy . they are f -- -- -g nsync for another generation
i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack ... they are horrible pieces of s $ # ! ? * & % # ! # $ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put `` low rider '' on the soundtrack , how cheap is that
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book . the book was anything but funny . i read about half , up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore . i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me . the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a <NUM> yr. old was just sick . i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it . i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick , mentally ill characters . i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
we were very disappointed with this bob the builder dvd . my children love bob the builder and own every video . we were excited to hear that a new one was coming out soon ( especially on dvd ) . however , it is not new ! every episode on this dvd is on the other videos ( or has been on the nick jr. show at least <NUM> months ago ) . i would have never thought they would release a new dvd/video without any new episodes . if this is your first bob the builder dvd/video , then i would recommend it . if you own many others , then do n't bother getting this one because you have already seen it
i was searching for a large type book of the current prayer book which the ad indicated that this was . what i received as a standard edition of the <NUM> version
i got this book because i enjoy good literature and the reviews were decent . i know some people say this writer is gifted , but i do n't see it . i thought it was a pretentious , depressing piece of crap . the characters were full of self-loathing and the `` bright ending '' did n't redeem anything , not the main character or the book
this book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach , which has been abandoned by many dog trainers . setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around
this book is awful . what a disappointment after such great success with theodore roosevelt . i forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that morris interjects willy-nilly throughout . what a chore , what a bore , what a waste . this went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as i did on it .
kid `` rock '' is to rock-and-roll what twinkies are to gourmet cooking . he 's a poseur and a pretender , who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- bob seeger , rolling stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent . why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available ?
this <NUM> page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it . i have not tried the recipes . i made an impulsive purchase of this book because i have been interested in building a brick oven for some time . i mistakenly thought that i would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from the bread builders by daniel wing and alan scott . i did not . there is , in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven .
negative ... the 1st season of the batman was ok , but the second season ruled ... third season is mediocre so far . i want the second season . the only worthwhile episode on this disc is `` the big chill '' . the other <NUM> are lack luster . the big chill had a lot of stale `` freeze '' jokes , but was well presented . a <NUM> out of <NUM> stars
i bought this book after see the movie as a child still great loved every minute of it
so what kind of movie is this from the director of `` i know what you did last summer ? '' it 's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function . deep down , venom is just another teen slasher movie . they rode into this film with the same clichÈd scares , a young group of teens , a psycho killer , and a traditional ending . so is it worth seeing ? that i ca n't completely answer for you . if you like more of the same old , then it 's probably going to be a blast . the filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane , overused plot . i found some parts to be slightly unpredictable , and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film . the voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply `` an unstoppable evil force . '' but individually , do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece ? quite frankly , in my opinion at least .... no . let 's take a look at some of them ; acting- well done , well directed too i might add . the acting is realistic to a degree , and brings us into the film . the actors responded ( for the most part ) realistically to the story line and i think that this was set-up nicely . the major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead , not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo . lighting- dim , dark and mysterious ; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film . combined with the swamp-like location , i think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful . special effects- they set this up pretty well . a few scenes made me cringe and i felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it ... or bled them out for it . the gore was n't excessive , but just right for a slasher film , and props to the director for making that call . my only qualm with this is that they used the standard halloween `` stage blood '' which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color . a few of the actors squirm around in it , only to look like they 're rolling around in pizza sauce . there are a few other tacky special effects , including the last major one in the film . the killer- mr. jangles .... ? enough said ... sounds like a dog . i 'll give the killer credit for being a good actor , but the portrayal needed a lot of work . the make-up kicked it up a notch , but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts did n't do it justice . the man looked like an athlete and moved like one ... not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of <NUM> evil spirits . although i do n't specifically know what that looks like .... i 'm sure they do n't run like football players . so what overall ? it 's ok. not something i 'd be dying to see , and i 'm glad that i did n't run to the theatre to catch the first showing . it has some good moments and some bad , but does n't really stand out from any normal hollywood production . my recommendation ? it 's ok . i 'd rather go rent containment instead ; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind . it 's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again ...
i 've seen all of elvis ' movies , most several times . this is one of the worst . only stay away joe and harem scarem are worse . i usually watch every elvis movie every time it comes on tv , but not these three
how can a group fall as far as they did ? `` who can you trust '' and `` big calm '' were both classics ( dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another ) . now with `` fof '' it just went down hill ... and never came back
although the song titles are great , the music sounds very flat . these songs are all likely original recordings . if you want to hear the original sound and imagine your stereo systems as one of those old horn-type record players , you 'll love this cd . otherwise , find something else
this dolf de roos book is no different from his other books , owning one is the same as owning all . writes about same topics and ideas . good author , trying to sell more books by using different titles . if you do n't own any of his books , worth the $ <NUM> or so for the book . however , if you do ... do n't waste your money/positive cash flow happy investin
another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought , over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time . did i mention over the top ? let 's face it , queen was a group of crypto-fascists , working hard to put a human face on thatcherism . ghastly stuff . k .
album covers kept on the right path for the players but the music just kept taken a beaten.billy beck is cool on certain songs & there are some moments here & there but compared to there hey day this is like a watered down version of the band.some of the music is alright but there is n't any stand-out material
this movie was kinda boring . not enough of cross ' standup . also when there was footage of his stand up , it wasnt that funny
unfortunately , i was forced to read this book by my photography professor . every word , every page , was sheer hell to struggle through . trying to follow barthe 's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible . this book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as `` english '' . he admits to not being a photographer , and goes on to claim photography itself does n't exist . how then , did he write a whole monstrous book on photography ? and moreover , why am i being subjected to it ? my heart is warmed somewhat when i read of mr. barthe 's history . he spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis , and ended it splattered across the front of a van . good . the bastard deserved it for what he 's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world .
being the fan of the rolling stones i picked up this cd thinking it was something similar . well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail miserably . they have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets them make cds should be forced to listen to it . if you buy this you are either a masochist or an idiot
about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music . the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick , incestuous , and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in . if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood , do n't watch this
although this book may be so brilliantly written by john reed , i found it to be too laden with historical details , and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her ( him ) self with the makings of the russian revolution for the first time . the book provides with a glossary of russian terms , events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so i found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there . however , due to my lack of knowledge of russian history i was unable to piece together any of the information . so , in frustration i gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a & quot ; history buff & quot ; . from this experience i learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing , it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book . the rest of the book should be written according to that outline . a glossary of main events would also be helpful . on the other hand i do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner . anyway , if you would like to expand your knowledge about the russian revolution , i highly recommend this book . however , if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts
they just sound like coldplay all over again . do we really need another coldplay band ? they seem talented enough to defy this genre , so i 'm wondering why they have n't
you can tell this movie was released in <NUM> because you can still see new york 's twin towers standing , and because of the groveling incantations of `` islam is a religion of peace , '' repeated often enough ( along with casting a good guy arab cop , tony shalhoub ) to offset any pc-incorrect image of portraying islamofascist terrorism . a measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of <NUM> and all the ghastly islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie , where denzel washington as fbi agent tries , via megaphone , to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation . he succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus . jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - beslan ( <NUM> children killed ) ? london ? madrid ? mumbai ? only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by denzel does the bus blow up . after a series of bombings in new york 's supermarkets , movie theaters , restaurants , etc. , pressure builds to call in the u.s. army under martial law . bruce willis , the army commander who is to take on this task , warns time and again that this is n't the proper role of the army , but then , as one of the president 's advisors explains in the movie , as if this is just one of those political things , the `` president wants to appear presidential . '' remember , this is <NUM> , and though critics of the movie , such as the new yorker , refer to willis 's character as a `` fascist u.s. army general '' , the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been , ahem , none other than bill clinton . the movie slides by that little detail , however , to make it look like willis , all on his own , is rounding up all able-bodied men of the muslim persuasion ( less draconian , by the way , than the rounding up of all japanese-americans on the west coast by fdr , where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie , but let 's not talk about that , either ; we 're still in <NUM> , after all ) . of course , the cia comes in for its usual whipping by hollywood , where cia agent annette bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see , she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok . oh , yeah , sure , women-hating al-qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty annette to train them ! but the best nonsense comes at the end : denzel washington and a handful of fbi agents rush into army combat hq and somehow surround bruce willis and pull their guns , saying he is under arrest for `` violating the constitution '' ( hey , why are n't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law , bill clinton ? ) . the general 's clueless security detail also draws its guns , and there 's a mexican standoff . denzel , using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from islamofascist murder on the bus , appears to be succeeding in talking the army soldiers out of using their guns to protect willis . so willis accepts the situation , allows himself to be arrested , and as the credits roll we see all these army vehicles leaving brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the `` fascist '' general . ta-dah ! so the movie , with a heap of literary license , proves at least one point at the end : back in the 1990s , it did n't take much for bill clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists . meanwhile , some day , sooner or later , the idea of pre-emptive internment of jihad-age muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on , if not here , then perhaps in france , the netherlands , russia , israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first . because it is not just the newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . when they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in new york sans the world trade center , willis will play the part of the hero , and whoever gets stuck with the fbi agent role will be the fool . i give the movie two stars instead of one , because i would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel , and two , because any movie with annette bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book
guys ... it 's not that good . i have the album on my computer , and i gave it a few listens , but ... it has no substance . it 's not interesting or anything new . it 's catchy . and irritating , after more than a song or two . that 's all ( `` bandages '' is enjoyable once in a while , i will concede ) . if you 're looking for catchy and poppy ( and there 's nothing wrong with that ) , then buy it . if you want something new and original - do n't . and if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like the faint , the bravery , or le tigre .
this guy is totally nuts . i was n't aware america was full of <NUM> year old slaves . who else could the reparations possibly be for ? what an idiot ... keep dreamin randall out of america : a black man confronts africa by keith richburg is much superior and faire
warning spoilers ... in the worst installment of a bad series , fitzchivalry wont die . perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely . fitz , who died , and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible . i supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while ( i guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain ) , and of course the seizures . seizures trouble fitz for a while , as long as they are convenient to the plot , and then , of course , they totally vanish . while i found it really interesting that fitz used to be dead , and the ramifications of that , we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever , except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab . i mean , he was reanimated after a period of time , but that 's no big deal i guess . robin hobb is such a good story teller , but she is horrible at plot . except in the liveship traders series , but she must have written that one entirely differently , because you ca n't tell that this is the same author . what she is good at is writing loveable characters , and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters `` learn '' about them . in other words she can `` feed the fire '' of the story well to keep interest . but that does n't mean she does it consistently , and this book is a great example of how even hobb can utterly fail . robin relys solely on you loving the characters ( which i feel she herself does ) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing . this book starts out slow , then begins the ending phase of the master plot , and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush . not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility . this whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother , yet supposedly kills without compunction . you know , an assassin . this series asks people a simple question . how would you describe an assassin ? prior to reading this series you might say ruthless , cold , cruel , at best disaffected and callous . crafty certainly . after reading this book , you would say , kind , affectionate , and loves dogs ? add to that loyal to himself first , good natured , well liked , and an advisor to royalty ? so is robin hobb rethinking the role of an assassin ? no , you ca n't do that . an assassin is an assassin . you ca n't change that fact . no , she 's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin , but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all , since that is a nasty business . as kind and good natured as fitz is , he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves . he never is actually put to any test . so , robin creates a hero , calls him an assassin , and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable except functioning as a cold-hearted killer . he 's a spy , a soldier , a telepathy partner , a wolf-buddy , and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero . when everything comes together , everyone just says fitz , be the hero . for no good reason at all ( because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to ? ) . [ ... ] perhaps robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension , and of course , they were being persued , and so i guess that added drama . but of course , the main threat , the `` forged ones '' were not really a threat anymore , but of course , you still have to resolve that issue , and was neatly done in the end . but i felt the whole story , the drama of the `` forged ones '' really was n't so dramatic , and i just do n't get what caused them to behave just like they did . on a fantasy scale , it was new , but not very interesting . robin does much better with dragons in the liveship traders , and these dragons are just stupid . and verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all . over all a slow build up for an overall letdown . if i began robin hobb with this series , i would have never read her again . i am forcing myself to finish the tawny man series now , because i want to like her stuff . but i do n't know if i will ever find enough time to finish that sleeper series . overall , try ship of magic , unless you are already invested in this , and have to have closure
sorry but this did n't cut it for me . it sounded more like a amateur rehersal tape than what i expect from the beach boys
my main gripe with this book is that there is not <NUM> picture . it makes it really hard to figure out what you are even making
ambush bay is not art . it is not entertainment . it is not even interesting . ambush bay is without a doubt one of the worst wwii movies ever produced . the best part of this movie is robert mitchum 's red cap , worn while he is in the philippine jungle hiding from japanese soldiers . red cap .... why not wear universal orange ? i 've seen the movie twice . once with the sound on . it was awful . i watched it again , with the sound off . it was better this second time . it had the feel , without sound , of an ok comedy . with the sound it was pathetic . do n't both buying it . spend your money on something more useful or entertaining .
what is this complete and utter insanity ? ! ? ! this & quot ; set <NUM> & quot ; was supposed to include woody allen 's very best & quot ; little & quot ; film & quot ; broadway danny rose & quot ; ! ! ! & quot ; shadows and fog & quot ; and no & quot ; broadway danny rose & quot ; ? ? & quot ; shadows and fog & quot ; is an excruciating waste of time . & quot ; september & quot ; ? & quot ; another woman & quot ; ? & quot ; alice & quot ; ? and no & quot ; broadway danny rose & quot ; ? the only picture worth bothering with in this & quot ; set <NUM> & quot ; is & quot ; crimes and misdemeanors & quot ; which is not only one of allen 's most brilliant movies , but just generally brilliant . what is the deal ? what is the problem ? where is & quot ; broadway danny rose & quot ; ?
i ordered this dvd on the premise of viewing a great , seriously done , artistic , erotic film based on the reviews it had already . what i watched had to be the stupidest movie i have ever seen ! not only was the story line not complete ( you basically have to assume a lot because it does n't talk about the origin of the beast at all [ what the hell was that , a werewolf ? ] , but it also delves into comedy sometimes , unintentionally [ like the idiotic screeming and running around of the girl near the end ] ) . and the guy dressed in the beast costume , well , i guess they were n't that into special effects back then except for the `` gallons '' of ejaculate they used in the rape scene . totally stupid ! if this was great euro-sex of the <NUM> 's , i 'll stay away from anything else produced by this guy . the best sex in here was at the beginning with the horses and then the servant getting it from the daughter ( who they should have used in more of the scenes ) , but then it 's all down hill from there . thank god i only spent $ 9.99 on this crap ! i do n't even want to give this one star , but i guess i have to to get this submitted so i have to put it down :
the dvd played semi relevant sub titles ( in english ) randomly throughout . we were unable to remove them . absolutly sub-standard .
if you are n't really into jokes about the difference between black/white , sex , drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you . i had seen other stuff by pryor i always liked but this time i never once really laughed out loud . it was dissapointing , good thing he has so many other good stuf
why should we take anything this author says seriously . he 's last and only other book was a national enquirer style tell or -- or rather tell nothing -- about a friend who trusted his confidence -- jfk jr. bradley cant even use his real name -- richard blow . he 's a phony and he decided to try to add some panache to his alleged role as a writer by doing a `` serious book about an institution . '' i read the book ... it 's all speculation based on zero research . it 's essentially a cut and paste job . forget it . dont waste your time .
pros : they sing well . cons : none of the carols are complete . they draw you in with a little teaser , tack on a big finale , then dash on to the next just as you start responding . worse , the tracks bleed into one another , so randomizing playback sounds just awful . i 'd love to have a recording of unabridged christmas carols with this caliber of musicality , but ca n't recommend this cd
this is one of the few remixes that left me hanging . there was no imagination . what 's the point ?
my real rating is 1.5 stars . the book wo n't put you to sleep , but it 's not going to teach you anything you wo n't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years . readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport : though the closest i 've ever gotten to golf in my <NUM> years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood , i learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent . feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context : what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity . hence , for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time , the book will be useless . bad points : besides that mentioned , the prose is ( as mentioned in my title ) in large measure cliches and reads , as other reviewers have pointed out , like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure . for newspaper articles , such is no great handicap , but for a book is makes for tediousness . next is a quibble , perhaps , but in the trade paperback edition i picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book . the book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper . if you 're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none ( as i was when i selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion ) , `` a good walk spoiled '' will suffice . if you 're looking for a good book , look elsewhere
boring and irritating . not one character is likable , and not one character is 3d
this play caused a great controversial stir when it was first performed in <NUM> . this is supposed to be a classic example of an existentialist and absurdist play . it was pinter 's first stage play and the one that made his reputation . although it was very daring and shocking in <NUM> , the play has aged and lost its freshness and original power , in my opinion . there are many other portrayals of dysfunctional families that have retained their freshness and power -- such families have been a mainstay of drama from the time of the ancient greeks . shakespeare and even fairy tales have built themselves around exploring the dark and abusive aspects of the family dynamic . so pinter 's on to nothing new or radical here . the script as such is blatantly misogynist . the one female role , ruth , has no lines that sound human -- she comes across as a stilted android . ruth is so obviously not a real woman but a male projection of lust , fear , possession , hate , and paranoia . i recently saw this play performed in manchester , uk , and have to wonder why people still think this play , with all its misogynist posturing , is relevant to a contemporary audience . if it were just a black absurd comedy , it might have worked better for me , but pinter seems to be aiming at something deeper and more menacing yet ca n't seem to make up his mind if we 're supposed to be feeling sympathy with his characters or taking them ( and the underlying meaning of the play ) seriously or not
the book was in fairly good condition . but , i paid to have it shipped in two days , it did n't come for <NUM> weeks !
this is pure dung , i ca n't believe that luca turilli was involved with this cd
i really tried to enjoy this book but just could n't manage to like it by the last page . this story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self , all through the magical lazelle family . i found it to be simple minded and rambling . i 'm not even sure the author was <NUM> % where she was going in this book . the main character , gypsum , receives her powers later in life than her family . she was previously cast as the `` normal '' one , alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic . her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times . not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society . most of the story runs like this : `` i almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds . i need a cup of coffee '' the author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over . everything is so strained and just plain wierd that i could n't get into it . there is no personality in any of the characters . if it were n't for the adult situations and language i would have pegged this as a young adult novel . i think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored . i gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties . blah .
j.k. rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book . the characters personalities were wavering in book <NUM> , in this they completely vanished or mutated . i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way . in books one through four the trio of harry , ron , and hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . book <NUM> had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more whining than day saving . book <NUM> made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done . this book harry seemed to care more about romance . a very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from previous books . a female character from the background , whom harry barely even notices all through the past five books , is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion . several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence . the clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another . the image of harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with malfoy . as to the general plot of the book . poorly done . continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . most of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information , and the culmination of what harry was not-quite-solving did n't amount to anything . my final opinion : do n't bother to read past book <NUM> if you 're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization . a very disappointing book
this show deserved to get cancelled , and there 's a very simple reason . this is supposedly dry , subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry , subtle comedy . it 's a show that was presented to the fox audience , an audeince that normally likes the most inane , low-brow kind of humor , that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it . meanwhile , to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor , the so-called comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable . every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke , it 's clear how forced and contrived it is , how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor , something they clearly do n't understand . it 's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch , because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat . it 's just an awkward mess . but those are n't the people this show is targeted at . it 's targeted at that fox audience who has never even seen dry humor before , and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them . they think this show is brilliant because it 's a little smarter than mad tv , or at least thinks it is . and since those are the people who are seeing the show , you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is . if the show were on hbo or some other network , exposed to a different kind of audience , you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works . so why did this show get cancelled , when so many people think it 's so amazing ? if it 's so great , people would have actually watched it , right ? so where were the ratings ? the fact is , the people who love this show are a very vocal minority . the audience for dry humor did n't watch this show because it 's not funny . but the audience who was fooled by this show , as vocal as they are , was just too small : they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it . this is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for tv , as its apologists claim . no , it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes
i should know by now that anything oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy . but this tome pegs the kumbayaometer . i do n't know what was worse , morrie 's trite , godless , and lapsed-jewish advice to `` be nice to those we love '' or mitch albom 's profiteering off a friend 's gruesome als death . what is it with america that we flock to this shallow i 'm okay-you 're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity ? is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age ? as a sidebar , what is it with oprah and her ilk ? that a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic . safe to say , anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting albom should be avoided and anything the big o pushes should be rejected out of hand . by the way , i read this drivel in a barnes and noble while i waited for a phone call one afternoon . if you must read it , get it at a library and keep the money from getting to mitch
this pile of crap , like all poser efforts , was created to make money . after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge , tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in . after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period , gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie , but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had . all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament . the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative . but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right , saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records , how true

this book gives lots of chemical demonstration ideas . however , some are entirely too dangerous to do . you must use a lot of common sense when considering doing any of these demonstrations . some are not safe at all . mercury and ccl4 are epa regulated . it 's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students ... this only demonstrates bad lab techniques . make sure you do the first experiment in the book outside or in a fume hood . it releases a strong odor and an acid vapor . definitely not something you want your students breathing
i am a fan of ottmar 's work so i did not hesitate when i found a copy of this album for sale . though not a terrible record it is not what your average ottmar fan has come to expect . the orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst . ottmar 's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements . none of it is horrible , and a few cuts are even interesting , but my guess is that the typical ottmat leibert fan wo n't be listening to this cd more than once or twice . there are far better choices for anyone who likes ottmar 's work . stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else ( as i will be doing )
wow , i sampled the songs on this new cd and i really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness sting used to bring to the music . like deniro and pacino . where are they now ? doing comedy and bland movies . not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch . stings voice is still among the best in the world , just the music behind him is what makes his cds bland and uninteresting . i mean , techno and rap . it 's like a mundane chant , much like the sting of the past used to sing out about . it looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it 's also consuming those that used to be the best . it 's really a shame to see an artist like sting decline in his work . brand new day was the start . although it was n't all bad , but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style . oh , well , albums like `` ten summoner 's tale '' , `` nothing like the sun '' , `` soul cages '' , and `` dream of the blue turtles '' were the best of his solo career . now , he 's just earning a paycheck . farewell sting . it was nice knowing you
legally blonde <NUM> - red , white & blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit <NUM> , legally blonde . i love the original so much but the this one is slow , boring , has a stupid premise , and reese looks like she hated filming this movie . all the magic is gone , people still treat elle like she is an idiot . sally field 's character is heartless and cold as well , luke wilson makes a brief apparance as elle 's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end . this sequel focuses on animal rights in washington d.c. elle worries about the safety of her dog , the adorable bruiser but i just could n't get in to the story or new characters . poor reese , she is a wonderful actress , but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on . forget this film , buy the original instead .
although i am not a veterinarian , i have worked in an animal hospital for two years . first of all , according to our medical practice , this book gives some bad nurishment advice ! milk ( and milk products such as cream and half & half ) are not a good food for many cats . their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows ' milk . having said what was foremost on my mind , i am also very disappointed in the `` behavior '' advice from this author . i found very little information on kittens ..... and almost nothing useful ( which is why i purchased this book in the first place ! ) . in fact , i absolutely disagree with ms. wilbourn 's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home . from the new kitten arriving via `` escort '' to you ( as the responsible owner ) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon , as your adult cat `` takes care of himself and his kitten '' . what dangerous nonsense this is ! stop and think ..... what a <NUM> lb . adult could do to a <NUM> lb . kitten , if so inclined ? perhaps the cats in manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized ( as opposed to ms. wilbourn 's coined word `` catsonality '' ) then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar ? for the record , i currently have a terrific <NUM> year old , as well as a very feisty <NUM> month old . i should have seen warning signs when this <NUM> page ( large print book ) began with a <NUM> page forward . no doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate ms. wilbourn 's considerable knowledge . sorry , it does n't . bottom line ? save your money and try another author .... preferably someone with the letters d.v.m after his or her name
what 's worse than a bad cd ? `` the burdens of being upright . '' i do n't even know where to start . i bought it because i really liked the first song `` mother mother '' ( which is the only reason why tracy bonham even gets <NUM> stars from me ) ... and i was completely disappointed with the rest of the album . the songs are n't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money . unless its used and only costs like , two bucks . actually , when i went to to trade it in at the record store , they only offered me <NUM> cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them . and i took the quarter ! if you like grunge music , there 's a chance that you might like this , but you most likely still wo n't
these writings seem quaint and offensive by today 's standards . these are wholly disappointing stories from a mediocre writer , like a second-rate steinbeck . cooper seems completely in love with his meal ticket , but i doubt this collection will draw any new admirers
ok so i was reading the reveiw for this album and i heard a lot of people talkin trash , and a lot of people talkin candy canes and butterflys . so im here to set the record straight . first of all , to all the folks who think this band is so great ... yes in the early years they had a good sound , and their songs ant bad , but they really sold out . you can walk into any mall right now and find sum <NUM> year old wearing a casualties shirt , or hat , or wallet , or patch , or toilet seat . they did the warped tour for gods sack . they obviously are worried more about money and fame then music . this has turned into teenybopper music , the same little @ # ! ^ 's that listen to blink <NUM> and sum <NUM> have this album . they go into a hot topic and buy it on cd with their mommys credit card , along with a <NUM> dollar pair of pants that look like sumone made in a clown college . this is not a great punk band , its punk for yuppies . and to all the people that think its the worst band ever ... i am so sick of hearing idiots that think they know everything about punk trashing the casualties saying they are fashion punks ... wether you wunna believe it or not punk has always had to do with clothes ... look at the new york dolls , alice cooper , richard hell , or the sex pistols . they all had a look , a image , and they started this whole thing . `` they said hey richard are you going to go out tonight , i said i am unsertent , i ant feeling to right . but i wriped up my shirt , watched the mirror and flirt , yeah im going to go out , out into sight. '' . and im sick of hearing about how they dont know how to play ... no punk bands know how to play , one of the reasons that punk is so great is that anyone can pick up a guitar or a drum set and start a group . so in closing , your all idiots that know nothing about punk music , old or new . your opinions reflect your ignorance about the punk scene and non of you should ever call your selves punks .
let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review -- first , i relaly do n't care for remixes as a rule , unless they 're dramatic and severely restructure a song , i generally find they add little . second , i really do n't care for `` the hand that feeds '' . having said that , the piece is presented in three mixes , the album version , the straight mix , and the dub mix . the album version has a catchy , circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that 's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section . just does n't work . the remixes fare no better -- the straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious , the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus . if you 're a fan , get it . if not , skip this one , there 's good reasons it was n't released in the u.s
it sucks , she sucks . ooooooooooooooooo big suprise . she might as well just cry , cause that is what every sane person that listens to this crap will d
this deal was the biggest rip off ! what did indeed happen to the extra videos promised on the back ? victory , just keep reaping that bad press ..
this is a really thin book , and for the price , the production value is terrible . the graphic design , and poor layout , takes a lot away from the information of the book . page after page , you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s . the information was light , and just skimmed over details . there was way too much emphasis on analog . there are other search softwares out there . the case studies were nice , but no real insight was given . overall - it 's an overpriced fluff book . could be summaried in <NUM> pages
let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic . regardless of the fact that it did n't stick with a few key plotlines in the book , everyone still did a great job adapting the original jurassic park . then came this piece of trash ... whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book , this one just takes the brilliant writing of michael chrichton and throws it directly out the window . first off , john hammond is supposed to be dead . he dies at the end of the first novel . secondly ian malcome is supposedly dead , or at least mia at the end of the first book , and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd . there is no bratty daughter , and the entire premise has much more to it . most importantly ... the entire ending in san diego with the t-rex ... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies ... did not exist in the book ! i went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot , a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist , and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off . what i ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page . not only that ... but because of the lack of plot , the dino scenes are complete over-kill . when you see so much of it , you lose that awe and wonder of the first film . when you see that brachiosaur in the first <NUM> mins of the original film , the wonderment is difficult to rival . there are no such moments in this film . if you 're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you 're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline , flick off the dvd player and pick up the book . oh and one more thing ... do n't go near the 3rd movie . they did n't even have a book to be untrue to . i ca n't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one
any album that lists the `` iowa fight song '' followed by ( iowa state ) ca n't be any good . it 's the university of iowa fight song , not iowa state university . and from the preview i heard , they did n't do it justice anyway
if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them . this movie was not scary . it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters . you know what the best part was ? when it was over . few movies compel me to write reviews , good or bad . this one obviously did
i am glad to see i am not the only one who thought this book was bad . i listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along . i ca n't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting . i was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good
c'mon - at least get a cd with examples that actually compile ! if he were a programmer working for me , he 'd get fired . save your money , and you can buy mine as used for 1/2 price .
very disappointed with this dvd . like i said above , if you want to view a rockumentary watch vh1 alot cheaper . description very misleading
frist of all this is an okay album do n't get me wrong , but i bought it because johnny ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really is n't . plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom , with two tin cans on a string : one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it . catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again i 'd probably just d/l essential tracks like i ca n't be and i do n't wan na be learned/i do n't wan na be tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced ramones album like end of the century or pleasant dreams
contentwise , i wo n't toss darts or roses . this is genre stuff . you either like it or you do n't . my beef is with the technical quality . it is execrable . ( <NUM> ) it is not in widescreen ( cinemascope ) , which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular . there is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a dvd issued in the year <NUM> . ( <NUM> ) the so-called `` digital remastering '' must be kitchen-table grade , because the shapes are fuzzy , colors oversaturated , visuals mushy . this dvd should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted . i get better quality from my vhs of this movie than the dvd i purchased . lousy lousy lousy , as i said .
i tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blank now i 've givin up this is the first time this has happen
i can see very little reason for the dalai lama to write a book on science . he is out of his league in writing this book . he does not at all understand his subject matter . his points on the convergence of modern physics and buddhist philosophy are irrelevant . first , any similarities between modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and buddhist philosophy are purely coincidental , and are not reflective of any deep truth . we arrive at scientific knowledge through a process of hypothesization and experimentation , the hypotheses being rigidly defined and definitely falsifiable . buddhist philosophy does not contain this same element of falsifiability , its grounding in the empirical world being loose and open to interpretation . one can not describe an objective procedure to rigorously falsify a buddhist claim . further , these claims are not rigidly defined , and widely open to interpretation , unlike the claims of modern physics , which result in a single answer to a calculation ( although in practice one will end up making subjective approximations , but there is a procedure for estimating the error incurred in these approximations ) . second , it is not at all surprising that one can draw some superficial parallels between physics and buddhism , because the body of buddhist thought is large enough and equivocal enough that one could point to similarities no matter what physics ' worldview is . i do not understand the dalai lama 's request that research in the subject of consciousness include internal examination . the definition of the nature of this internal examination is unclear , and procedure for carrying it out are not described . his suggestions are useless to scientists without being made more clear . his claims on what science is and is not capable of achieving or understanding are based on insufficient knowledge . even respected , established scientists who make claims on what science can not achieve have historically been proven incorrect many times over . i commend the dalai lama 's interest in science . further , i am amazed at his open-mindedness in writing , `` if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in buddhism to be false , then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims . '' he proved true to his word in renouncing certain buddhist beliefs about the physical workings of the universe . however , his understanding of the method and teachings of science proved superficial when he argued that because science has not conclusively proven it completely understands the beginning of the universe or the origin of life , this leaves room for supernatural influence to have caused the universe to exist , or for new souls to inherit old ones through reincarnation . science treats questions of the supernatural ( defined as those things beyond nature , in other words those things that can not be observed ) as fundamentally unanswerable and uninteresting , but the dalai lama does not seem to understand this attitude . the dalai lama has discussed science with many leading researchers and philosophers of science , such as david bohm and arthur zajonc . i have no doubt that these he is well-informed , and that these men have done their best to impart their knowledge . but the gap between western and eastern thought in this case may be too wide to be easily bridged , and the responsibility lies in another man to do it . it may be that no one alive has a truly deep understanding of both buddhist philosophy and the philosophy of science . finally , i also applaud the dalai lama 's calls for collaboration , and his attempts to spread some introductory knowledge of buddhist thought . but the task of creating productive dialogues between scientists and buddhists is an overwhelming one , involving not only language barriers , but barriers involving fundamental modes of thought . this book is not equal to the challenge , but i think the dalai lama 's initial efforts are at least a step in the right direction
sorry to say that i 'm very dissapointed to own this book . for those who are new to vba , it is not a good start from here . i also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program . i would recomend a book written by john walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical
it is because of this book and the other books james fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack , that people have lost so much interest in the jfk assassination . honest authors like harold weisberg and david wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up . the z-film was altered , many know this , the warren commission published it in volume <NUM> ( 18h1-84 ) with frames missing . in case you do n't know this , that counts as alteration . z-film tampering was not to the extent that fetzer claims such as painting jackie 's face on the film itself . the film was not stolen , or doctored up in anyway . no one would be dumb enough to take that risk
really an album that should be played in the background , if at all - it 's slow and wandering music wo n't keep your attention for long and rightly so . and other reviewers are correct about the lyrics , if you 're still paying attention you 'll be less than impressed . i 'm amazed at how many reviews can be written here with absolutely no reference to built to spill - a band this album really really wants to be . it 's true that this album , with its guitar work and focus on an atmosphere over progression , sounds very very much like parts of the built to spill albums . but would i compare this album to bts ? or death cab ? no chance . it 's just got nothing to offer other than background - nothing is being created here . no novelty . the horns people talk about in other reviews are out of place and forced - like your best friend 's idea you ca n't talk him out of . two stars seems a little harsh , but it 's a gift . i ca n't honestly recommend people buy this album when you can get built to spill or death cab for cutie albums which give you this and so so much more . * * * * update * * * * trust me , the built to spill comparison is valid . everyone should go listen to them both and i promise you 'll get it
i have a fairly extensive collection of comedy albums , and i gatta say this is probably one of the lamest i 've ever heard . if you enjoy hearing a one-line joke dragged out to 5-6 minutes ( like the worst episodes of snl ) , then maybe this is tolerable . maybe once . the people giving this high ratings are either norm 's friends or people too young to have experienced true wit . trust me , if you listen to this once you will probably never play it agai
ok ! so it had a swiss cheese plot . that 's not so unusual for a soft core move is it ? i 've seen my share of soft porn movies and usually , not always but usually , what was lacking in a storyline was made up by the fact , that numerous gorgeous gals were romping around in the altogether , doing stimulating things to make you forget , there was even supposed to be a plot . yes , bacchanalles had a lot of nudity and a lot of make believe sex but except for the star , joelle coeur , who was genuinely a looker , most of the rest , looked like the girls , that get better looking at closing time . i know everybody ca n't always be fussy about the women they make love to , but certainly , they can be fussy about the ones they watch women make love . right ? so what do we have ? we have a plot , which , believe it of not , could have been the inspiration for `` eyes wide shut '' . oops ! i 've already said too much ! bacchanalles sexuelles , meaning ` sexual festival ` , features a generally unattractive cast of amateurish , stiff ( not that way ) actors and actresses , performing mostly sans clothing , in a fairly low budget , thirty year old erotic , french movie , with subtitles , where you sometimes have to choose between reading the subtitles , or watching the action . still interested ? read on . valerie , the one bright spot in the movie , played by joelle coeur , who along with her friend sophia , ( brigette de borghese ) is apartment sitting for her cousin , when sophia , unbeknownst to valerie is kidnapped by a sex cult . valerie is awakened in the morning by fred , whom sophia apparently invited over without valerie 's knowledge . fred forces valerie to have sex , which she ultimately enjoys . in the meantime the culprits realize they have kidnapped the wrong girl , for they really needed valerie and not sophia for their evil purposes , so the head seductress , ( my expression ) sends one of the cultists , pretending to be a maid , back to the apartment to garner information on valerie , where she promptly ends up in a bathtub with valerie and fred before taking their ma ` nage a trois to the small ( double ) bed in the bedroom , where the action continues for what seems like hours . eventually the real maid shows up and fred and valerie , the super sleuths ( that ` s sleuths as in detectives , not sluts as in .... ) that they are , start to unravel the mystery of sophia . but not until we have a half dozen more sex scenes including the grand finale , an orgy of cultists . wow ! conclusion i suppose this movie in a sense was an orgy . an excess of mediocrity . it also had a sense of absurdity . this may have been purposeful , which , it was would somewhat mitigate against the amateurish feeling of the film , however , that said , for all it ` s weaknesses , it was n't that bad . like i said the story was full of holes and except for two ladies , the femmes were closer to homely than attractive , or they were hard and used looking . that said , their bodies were decent and the were enough ( probably a dozen ) sex scenes , that i would n't stop anyone from watching this bomb . another point should make is that being filmed over thirty years ago and in europe , the girls were unshaved , including in some cases , under the arms . also the color quality was a little flat .
... this had the sacd logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed , implied that this was in 5:1 . shame on you . it is in stereo . i have always enjoyed this album that came out when i was in high school and have a stereo copy already . when i saw it in the sacd section of best buy , i thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound ! it was a severe disappointment to see that it says stereo in small letters on the back after i had opened it already . if i had n't opened it , i would have returned it . why bother putting out a sacd if it is only in stereo ? ?
i was very excited to read this book ! i ran home , got comforable and started reading . i found myself skipping through the pages . i found it was very myth based , and too much about religion and jesus and mary . i bought it because i love tori and have been fascinated by her . i wish this book was more about her life , her childhood . i have read less then half this book , and i will either force myself to finish , or return the book . i really am sadly dissapointed . tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again . i have bought her cd 's <NUM> and <NUM> times each because i listened too much and the cd was worn . i really do n't suggest anyone to buy this , you will be let down , just as i was .
either drinking , cursing , and laughing in the pub , or replaying the messy home life style . what is this ? you call this 'one of the year 's top <NUM> movies ! ' , 'two thumbs up ! ' , 'one of the year 's funniest ! ' ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? this is one of the most terrible movies with bore-to-death storylines i 've ever seen . acting maybe acceptable but , with such a lousy script and a bunch of ugly young female actors , i have to pass . wasted my money was fine , but wasted <NUM> minutes watching this silly movie ? well , absolutely not ! rejected the dvd out of the player after about <NUM> minutes . thanks for nothing
where my gifter managed to get an original and brand new copy of this one i have no idea , the bottomline is that it is now part of my collection and i am here to say what i think of it . it could have been improved . it 's major flaw other than the relatively crude animation is the characters , rather unlikeable heroes and hilarious villains that you strongly wish would win in the end since they are more likeable than those known as heroes . the story does n't change much from scene to scene , <NUM> dalmatian puppies have been kidnapped and must find their way home by going from place to place avoiding cruella devil and her henchmen . recommended ? not really , it has it 's moments of warmth , but otherwise , it is n't one of disney 's greatest films
this is at best a rip-off of the tremendous talent we have come to know as shinia twain , country singer . this music may have done well and good in it 's time , but shinia is a bonafide country queen now and for anyone to use her name and status to capitalize on anything but the country music star we have all come to know and love is a rip-off . yes , this album is a rip-off as is . were it presented as shinia ( eileen ) , circa <NUM> , `` disco queen '' it would have been a fairer description of this music then what it was . can i get my money back ? 3of4 el centro , ca
there are several questions i have after listening to this cd . why are the tempos so crazy ? the opening number plods along like a funeral march , while at the ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank . part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track . why does everything sound so thin ? these orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings . on this cd , it 's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life , sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound . sometimes , obviously live instruments sound like midi . usually it 's the sound engineer 's job to make the opposite happen ! why are the vocals so `` hot '' ? in the obc , there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra . now it 's the vocals that tear at the balance . who cast this show ? i 'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude , but -- oh screw it . you deserve to know . this cassie is some serious vocal ugly . i did n't once wonder along with zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line , like i did with ms. donna mckechnie 's fabulous triple threat . why not update some of the orchestrations ? i have a deep and abiding respect for jonathan tunick ( who is among my top three favorite broadway creative types ) , but it 's <NUM> . wah wah pedals are out . overall , although this cd is good for completists , it 's not going to knock the obc recording out of it 's slot as the definitive a chorus line recording . if you do n't have a chorus line cd and are trying to decide which one to buy , track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast . it 's vintage , but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast
i had worn out my copy of the firm 's 5-day abs so i thought i would try something new . bad decision . there are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really do n't feel one exercise before you move on to the next . in addition , you really need to buy the `` firm sculpting stick '' to make many of the exercises work , which i found insulting and rather marketing-minded . i am sending this back
the whole album was really bad . the group did not harmonize well on the ensemble songs . tamyra screamed her way through silent night , a very mediocre version of silver bells , performed by kimberley locke and clay aiken . a boring i 'll be home for christmas , by idol wannabee , but charming , justin guarini had me falling asleep . and winter wonderland probably came close to being the worst on the album , but this christmas , sung by ruben studdard beat it . ruben 's charm has disapeared since the show . the vocal performance itself was horrible , but as was the song . what ever happened to traditional christmas ? i 'll have to wait for clay aiken 's christmas album to be released this october . but the highlights are have yourself a merry little christmas - a duet by tamyra gray and ruben studdard , the christmas song sung by kim locke , and , the best , the first noel , sung by clay aiken . think i 'm being biased towards clay ? by the album and see for yourself . and of course kelly was great . she tends to & quot ; scream & quot ; sometimes , but she did a good job on & quot ; oh holy night and my grown up christmas list - there are better versions then her out there , but kelly is really a great singer
`` the hospital '' as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience . it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one . i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's `` network '' and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness . i 'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole . if george c.scott 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding , drinking , or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant ? diana rigg is completely wasted in this film . her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by scott 's character . the film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of arthur hiller . the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
the kaiser chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the uk . give me a break ! these guys are about as stimulating as a coma . mundane has apparently become mainstream . i am probably older than your average reviewer , having purchased jimi hendrix albums when he was still alive , and gone to replacement shows in minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews . i thoroughly enjoy uk rock . i wore out copies of quadrophenia in high school and love bloc party , franz ferdinand , and the music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of who fans who continue to relish british pop and rock . maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but i produce more interesting music on my mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear . i have never written a review before , but my disapointment in this cd has driven me to this rant ! i love this uk revival of sorts and solute you all . long live rock ! kaiser chiefs ... learn to play those instruments you suck ! for those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of the jam or the clash look elsewhere . maybe the rakes or maximo park will fill the need
boyd 's revised edition of virgil 's aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the ap latin : virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all classicists . with all the lines on the ap syllabus and no more , boyd 's aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test . each page has a paragraph of latin text , with numerous footnotes underneath , offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints . a glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words . while clyde pharr 's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary , the pharr text contains all of books 1-9 only , meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the aeneid . thus , boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered : it contains only what is on the syllabus . it is a great way to study virgil 's classic epic
this is a compilation of many different styles ; look yo-yo can play bluegrass ! not really & quot ; classic & quot ; yo-yo
if you want the same old , bang bang rob the bank , movie then go ahead and by this low brow movie . take it from me it sucks
sigh ... like most of andrew lloyd webber 's sheet music , selections from phantom of the opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts . even worse , the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all , rather it simply follows the vocal line . this might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist , but for a real musical theater fan , it 's very disappointing . so far , i 've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment ( an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score ) . the singer 's musical theatre anthology : soprano , vol . <NUM> , compiled by richard walters features `` think of me '' and `` wishing you were somehow here again '' in their original form . for performers and accompanists alike , there 's something to get excited about . so far , we 're still waiting on more from the phantom of the opera , but they 're creating a 4th edition of the anthologies soon , so watch out
this was a mess . this movie gave me the feeling that i was was watching a really bad made for tv film . i was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was . everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles . viggo mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan . all in all , this film was predictable , formulaic and a bore . please save your money for something worthwhile
i have always liked r. kelly 's music . when he produced `` trapped in the closet '' , i thought it was a joke . this is one of the stupidest , corniest , and blandest song i heard .
the moviegoer is a book about a <NUM> year , disaffected businessman . he 's successful and liked , from a rich new orleans family , but bored with life . he does n't know what he wants , and does n't know what to do about it . this description , however , sounds like binx bolling , the main character , is actually doing something to figure out what 's wrong . unfortunately , the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him . while interesting from a theoretical , philosophical , existential point of view , it makes for boring reading . in addition , the book , released in <NUM> feels badly dated , about a time and place that no longer exists , so while i have experienced my own bouts of existential angst , binx 's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight . this is in stark contrast to kafka , for example , whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century prague can bring me to tears . while the novel is set in new orleans , there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets . similarly , binx remains a faceless everyman , and the women he dates so interchangeable that binx himself can barely keep them distinct . the title , too , is misleading . `` the moviegoer '' made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies . while binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors , i have to assume the title refers to binx 's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie . like the existential play `` waiting for godot '' this story is mostly about the lack of a story , and though things happen , there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward . if you 're looking for an existential novel , i 'd strongly recommend kafka 's the castle or the trial instead . and if you 're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of new orleans with a truly memorable set of characters , a confederacy of dunces ( john kennedy toole ) ( which walker percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author ) is among the best novels of our times . but the moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff .
`` killing me softly '' has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation , but the big `` twist '' at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable ( unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life ) . the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking ; fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned , he 's an inexpressive bloke , while heather graham is all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera . besides , she 's not even that attractive ; even her co-star in this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out of the water in that department . the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker ' candy in your mouth , sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour . it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did , i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly in spite of all that , chen kaige 's direction is good , and he creates some suspenseful moments . so i give the film a generous `` * * out of <NUM> '' rating . but if you 're a heather graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes ; and for joseph fiennes fans you 'll receive half naked perks .
this performer deserves all the latitude necessary , as she may yet develop into a relevant , insightful , and original interpreter of the music she offers . i truly hope she does not choose to compete with eliot fisk in the indy-500 or the 24-hours of le mans . based on the samples , i wo n't be buying this cd as i can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster , and just as clear . instead , i recommend the frank bungarten recording ( also available on amazon ) . but ana vidovic does show a lot of promise , and deserves encouragement
i saw this movie quite a few years ago ( probably about <NUM> or <NUM> years ago ) . i must say the first time i saw it i was n't really impressed . then i read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie . so when it was released on dvd i went out and purchased it . i remember little about it from the first time other than it had sissy spacek in it in one of her first roles , if not her very first big screen role . i must say that i did n't find this movie any better now than i did then . i appreciate marvins career and his acting as well as gene hackman . these two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good . the story could have been much better and the core of it is good . marvin is a respected chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by eddie egan ( the real popeye doyle from the french connection drug bust in new york ) to collect $ 500,000 that an associate name mary ann has forgotten to pay . mary ann ( gene hackman ... and do n't ask me why he is mary ann cause they never explain it ) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house . he has sent back several other bag men to the chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them . mary ann also is now with marvins old flame clarabell ( jeez what is with these stupid names ? ) . mary ann also deals in white slavery , enter sissy spacek . he sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows . this is an interesting novelty kind of movie . if you are a fan of marvin or hackman check it out . even if you are a fan of sissy spacek . but alas this movie is just not that good . the old school mob vs the new middle america mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie .
glam rock died for a reason . all these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced . - thus says the pellingto
the cheetah girls are so full of themselves . i recommend the cheetahs girls to 5- year olds
the turgid , confused prose is a dead give away . so is the overblown praise for this poorly written book . the <NUM> star review from & quot ; the united states of america & quot ; has to be one of the authors . if so , then the call for & quot ; objective & quot ; reviews from a postmodernist is ironic , as well as amusing . also ironic is the book 's theme of exploitation -- -by relying on a dated , superficial review of scholarly research , as well as sleazy pop culture , the book itself appears to be a work of western exploitation . except this time , it 's the arrogant academics exploiting prostitutes , rather than their male customers . this harsh , intensely narcisistic diatribe may be good vita fodder , but it is not worthwhile reading
i like eyewitness guides a lot , particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information , but this really does n't make the cut . how is it possible to cram scotland into <NUM> pages ? well , it is not . besides having very poor coverage on glasgow and particularly edinburgh , it also has - well , more poor coverage . maps for the bigger islands in northern scotland are sorely lacking . more effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money . i know dk can make some really great guides , so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this
i tried not to give it any stars , which is what it deserves . i have a difficult time understanding why mr. eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he 's involved in . there are composers like harry gregson-williams , elliot goldenthal , james newton howard , david julyan , mark isham , etc ... that can create something meaningful and <NUM> times more advanced than what `` dirty harry '' can create . would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality ? i hated mystic river 's soundtrack as well . i think he got lucky with million dollar baby . not much music that might have ruined the acting , and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights , unlike the rocky movies . i am very aware that he does n't posess the education , training , and experience that all of the major hollywood composers do . but he should stick to acting and directing . he has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime . i think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie . and his `` music '' is nothing noteworthy at all , in my opinion . while his attempt to write another score is surprising , it leaves so much to be desired in a film like flags of our fathers . it 's a tremendous film , with an interesting story , great characters , great acting , and authentic battle scenes , much like saving private ryan ( john williams ) . they have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to , and make a great movie-going experience . and then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again . and then on top of that , it 's rudementally orchestrated between guitar , piano , and trumpet with those long droning strings . granted , not much to work with for lennie niehaus who orchestrated it . i got so sick of it on just one viewing only . and the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal , as stupidly simple as that melody is , i think it 's completely intrusive in that scene . it ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically , or maybe no music at all . i believe everyone has a job when making a movie , and when one person is doing too much , the quality suffers . and that 's if clint eastwood was an educated composer , which he is n't . no one can deny that , not even him . as i mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful . i think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like clint eastwood . film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves . and with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way , it 's not helping the film music world at all . it is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before . but when they do n't have any talent , they should n't be allowed to do it . i am an aspiring film composer taking classes , going to movies , and buying soundtracks to learn as much as i can about it . it gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films . i know it 's just clint eastwood attempting this , but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it ? please , no more soundtracks mr. eastwood ! you do what you are good at and leave the music to the established , experienced , and well-known composers of hollywood . bryan arata
you almost feel sorry for the author . draped in acclaim , among the books of the year , it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations . more worrying , the author 's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at harvard . and that 's what the book feels like , a very well executed assignment . it 's written in a fairly convincing pidgin english , but when it wavers , it breaks the rhythm and the belief . it also feels entirely formulaic . it goes through the trials of dehumanisation ( murder , rape , sodomy etc ) but it never engages the reader 's sympathy , just occasional admiration . there 's no doubt that iweala can write . i hope he dares to produce something fresh that does n't feel borrowed from another culture , another life . i 'd risk buying another book of his
i bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other . i have never been proven so wrong in my life . this album is inexcusably bad . ths following review sums it up exactly . <NUM> of <NUM> people found the following review helpful : deplorable ...... ! , september <NUM> , <NUM> reviewer : brendan `` bren '' ( new york ) - see all my reviews whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched mess of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album . nostalgia aside , never have i heard such an amazing , talented group of performers ( some of them amongst my favourites - aretha franklin , beyonce , stevie wonder , alicia keys , john legend , patti labelle , angie stone ) sound so unprepared , vocally dull , poorly produced and karaoke-like ! talk about the right singers singing the wrong songs and then the wrong singers singing the right songs - who had the gall to give 'never too much ' to mary j . blige ? ? ? and 'superstar ' to usher ? ? ? ? usher ? ? ? ? ? of all the incredible r & b singers in existence , including the completely acceptable version by ruben studdard , you will give a classic like 'superstar ' to usher ? ? ? unreal . this whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me .... my baby fantasia , im sorry , this is the worst thing i have ever heard her sing and i think fantasia is incredible . and what da * ! @ # ! ! is that bunch of musical messes in between - celine dion ( mediocre ) / donna summer ( a remix nightmare ) wyclef jean ( unspeakable ) beyonce & stevie ( boring , and i love those two ) aretha franklin ( a la divas live solo - all over the place ) / babyface ( boring ) patti labelle ( predictable ) - oh my goodness . too much . barely saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - john legend - truly an original sound - angie stone and jamie foxx ( would you believe ? ) . still - not the right songs to really make them shine . what a headache ... and perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - where was luther 's friend , background singer , performer extraordinaire and confidante on this project - lisa fischer ? ? ? ? ? abysmal i say again . suggestion - next luther vandross tribute - and im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of luther 's friends ... but please take some time to match the right song with the right singer .... and some new , interesting voices please ... do some research - there are people out there who are amazing , unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute .... ledisi , rachelle ferrell , raul midon , melonie daniels , will downing , leela james , lizz wright and a couple of undiscovered underground r & b/ jazz gems right here in new york , abby dobson , cole williams , r'kardo , gordon chambers , lynn lockamie , ryan shaw , sasha allen and the list goes on and on .... singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work ... i am appalled . may luther rest in peace , and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy .
the armenian genocide is a biased piece of propaganda , if you want a truly impartial view of the events buy and view `` the armenian revolt '' by martin callaghan an independent us producer it is much more professional and impartial in it 's production . what the armenian genocide does not tell you is that the armenians started revolting and murdered over 500,000 thousand turks to begin with . further , the statistics used in the program are bogus . even according to armenian sources there were not <NUM> million armenians living in the ottoman empire during that period . further , at the end of world war <NUM> the ottoman empire ceased to exist and the british controlled the former ottoman capital of istanbul . they conducted a witch hunt , they arrested <NUM> ottoman officials of the leadership including the then eqivulant to the prime minister and conveyed them to their island colony of malta . after two and a half years of exhuastive inquiries they could not find any evidence whatsoever to charge any of them let alone convict . all <NUM> ottoman officials were released and allowed to return home . further the investigator lord curzon ( well known for his hatred of turks ) asked the us government of the day to provide any evidence they may have had in their possession . an answer came back that the us did not have any evidence with which to use against the ottoman leadership . what the armenian diaspora could not achieve via armed conflict and legal means is now trying to achieve politically and by using propaganda like this particular documentary . there is always two sides to every story and the armenians will not allow the turks to put theirs forward .

alyssa milano 's mother ( who is also her manager ) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet . she 's denounced such websites ' `` exploitation '' on national tv , and has even developed a side business as a cybercop , lending her web-busting skills to other stars . milano 's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film . embrace of the vampire is softcore horror porn , and the source for many of those milano skin pics . after tv 's who 's the boss was canceled ( but before charmed returned milano to star status ) milano was just another unemployed former child actress , so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time . milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she 'd played in who 's the boss . in other words , she wanted to `` grow '' as an actress . so she did embrace of the vampire , in which she goes topless in several scenes , engages in a lesbian romp with charlotte lewis , and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body . mission accomplished . actually , embrace of the vampire uses milano 's virginal image from who 's the boss by casting her as ... a virgin . a virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend ( albeit asking him not to look ) , but still , a virgin . a virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and does n't know why . here 's why : milano is the reincarnation of martin kemp 's true love . some <NUM> years ago , a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy . now that he 's rediscovered milano , he has three nights to rekindle her love for him . if so , they will live forever as vampires . if not , he dies and loses her forever . why the sudden three-night deadline ? why not . the plot and motivations are paper thin , as is typical of porn . milano wanders around campus , wondering why she 's having so many sexual dreams , even daydreams . her boyfriend wanders about , wondering if she 's so pure . kemp wanders about , seen by milano but often not by others . lewis wanders about for some bisexual action . other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action . amid all this wandering there 's much carnal action , and more carnal dreaming . occasionally , kemp kills someone for dissing milano . john stanley ( in his creature features movie guide ) correctly refers to it as a `` meandering , almost formless script . '' kemp has the best lines . like many vampires , he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love . his appearance is a touch effeminate ( too much eyeliner ) , but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character . he is part romantic vampire , part bloodthirsty beast . lewis 's small part is pointless to the `` story . '' all that 's required is that she undress , and when she does , it was worth the wait . rachel true ( the craft ) has an even smaller role , the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on . all of the above three are more interesting , more charismatic , than milano or her boyfriend . at film 's end , kemp 's tearful bloodthirsty angst , and milano 's tearful rediscovery of her love , the `` tragic '' star-crossed ending , and the christian iconography , all mirror coppola 's bram stoker 's dracula ( <NUM> ) . one senses that director goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material . however , this is no poor woman 's bram stoker 's dracula . milano is no winona ryder and kemp is no gary oldman . for that matter , none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts . and the budget just is n't there . the strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity , which this film tries to hide rather than utilize . how low was the budget ? listen , i was an extra on both bram stoker 's dracula and embrace of the vampire . ( in both instances , i kept my clothes on . ) i worked one day on embrace of the vampire . do n't look for me , i ended up on the cutting room floor , and extras are rarely mentioned in credits . but let me tell you an `` inside story '' on the making of this film : we were shooting in a nightclub on the sunset strip . the extras were divided into three camps : union , nonunion , and modesto extras . union extras earn the most , especially once overtime kicks in , so they were wrapped after eight hours ( they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota ) . this was during my nonunion days ( i 'm in sag now ) , so i put in a full <NUM> hours , after which we were paid in cash and wrapped . the modesto extras were still working when we left . now what , you may ask , is a modesto extra ? i also wondered , and so i asked one . i was told they were from an acting class in modesto , california . they had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a `` class assignment . '' in other words , they were paying to come to work . there 's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra . it 's neither glamourous nor difficult . and nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are very easy to come by . the lampposts in los angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle , ehr , extras . i did it for the cash , and because if you do it often enough , you increase your chances of getting into the union ( which i did , after some <NUM> grueling months ) . never pay for the `` chance '' to be an extra , not in los angeles . i made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times , but wised up after a few months . my guess is the producers of embrace of the vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle , and far less than even nonunion extras cost . i know this teacher was getting paid by the students , and that they were not getting paid to be on the film . another inside story : someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member . she was near tears because it had sentimental value . never leave anything of value lying around on a set . and some trivia : john stanley says this film was `` originally conceived as the nosferatu diaries , '' but on the set , we were told the working title was the collector . embrace of the vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely . if you 're looking for horror , there are hundreds of better films . dozens of better vampire films . even many superior erotic vampire films -- vampyres ( british , <NUM> ) comes to mind . but if you 're looking for milano nudies , this is the film to see .
i can actually understand morvan 's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel . however , anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me . she did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period . i wish madeline had never written this book , given that this is the only one of her <NUM> novels ( if i remember the number correctly ) that i had to put down before reaching the end . i just could not take the characters , mainly anna . however , i loved to see david drop by : ) .. rags
the first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent . it gets worse . but who am i to say ? i quit on page <NUM> , shortly after the black belt <NUM> year aunt old scares the traumatized dog into the bath by putting on a ninja mask and jumping into the kitchen screeching , `` eyowwww . '' beyond awful
many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book . i agree and it is also very misleading . the characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character 's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket . things we can do without in gay fiction from now on : <NUM> . a spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character . yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just boring now in the books . <NUM> . a distant disapproving father and eccentric mother . yawn <NUM> . the flamboyant gay friend ( usually black ) first this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together ? - then it morphs into some sort of romance ( never worth your time ) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service ( fairly interesting ) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor . it never gels . i kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame . was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client ? ? ? ? if you want a real book about running and escort agency read the mayflower madam 's book . at least it 's interesting . if you have to read a book about a selfish gay man - i recommend `` california screaming '' and forget this trash .
i thought that this movie fell short of even b horror flick standards . i did like the scenic shots of the film but the dialog and the `` mutants '' of this film did n't really hold my attention . the `` mutants '' were not even mutants at all . they looked like everyday people that you would see on the street . well , they did n't look disfigured is what i mean . the guy that was acting like he was part of the `` rap culture '' was the most irritating of them all . i really wanted to like this movie , but i am sorry that i did n't . i do n't recommend this movie to anyone . even those b horror fans
sorry , i just thought the book was boring and worst of all , its a good story with alot of food for thought , but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined
one good thing about this movie is that it helped me find religion . it was so bad that i actually wrote a prayer : oh great and loving god , take mercy upon this , the lowliest of your creatures . burn my brain , i beseech thee ... yeah with fire , acid , turpentine , and super-hot hot sauce lay waste to the portion of my brain which remembers having viewed `` point blank '' with mickey rourke ! keep me safe and guide my steps far , far from future viewings , so that in thy mercy i might instead feast upon broken glass and burning hot lava , and smear my naked buttox with honey and lay me upon a hill of ants rather than ever see this film again . amen . like many of you , i first came across this little gem while searching for the <NUM> masterpiece of funkadelic nihilism starring lee marvin . well , of course that 's not out of dvd yet , but since i 'm a huge fan of mickey rourke ( for reasons which , as his career progresses , i find more and more difficult to remember ) , i thought `` wow , mickey rourke just re-made one of the coolest movies of all time ... might be worth watching . '' boy , was that a mistake ! first of all , this is not a remake of lee marvin/john boorman 's point blank . that 's two strikes against rourke , because he also starred in `` bullet , '' a stupid piece of crap which had nothing to do with steve mcqueen 's `` bullit , '' another of the great guy films of all time . it 's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and mickey rourke kills them . 'nuff said re the plot . one thing that really sticks out about this film is that rourke , typically a pretty muscular dude , is positively steroidal ! i mean , he put on so much muscle for this role that his skin literally looks as if it 's going to fissure and peel off ! i do n't know what he was on , but it must be something we normally use on farm animals
there 's nothing wrong with the performance : it 's gershwin himself , according to the editorial review , taken from a piano roll . `` music experience in 3-dimensional sound reality '' it says on the packaging . all i can say is , it 's a thin excuse for a surround-sound dvd-audio disc : the one track is the only thing on it . maybe <NUM> minutes , total , though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing . or that it 's remastered from a piano roll , for that matter . and all at a premium price ? you 've got to be kidding ! watch out for the entire dvd-audio series by alexander goldberg jero . i bought several , to fill out my dvd-audio collection , and none have lived up to expectations
i can not imagine what sony or their sad , sad technicians were thinking - or not thinking when they `` remastered '' this great musical . i hope - and one can only hope - whomever it was that `` remastered '' this music ( and i ca n't imagine why they would call it re-mastered ) that they got fired afterwards or went back to basic recording school . mastering a musical cd means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing . did sony imagine they 'd be able to sell this on it 's own merits ... that being an attractive , well known , sell-able music cd of a charming musical - while duping the buying public ( sadly me included ) that it would be something worth having for any broadway music collection ? ? well i was most assuredly fooled . even with my cheap ( sony by the way ) <NUM> track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition . i just can not abide that some highly technical `` master '' of recording equipment could n't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity , offered and distributed as a `` remastered '' version that should have been better than the original but sadly is n't even close . i thankfully , still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd `` mastering '' i have ever heard - and i 've heard a lot of quality remastered cd 's - but this is n't one of them . the only saving grace of this cd is some of the extras that have been included . but not at full price .. if you ask me . think twice or at least understand at the outset what you 're getting .... a very poorly `` rekindled - not remastered '' cd that has some singers sounding as if the `` technicians '' forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks . pretty sad , pretty sad . disappointing . love the musical - hate the lousy cd
finders keepers , by linnea sinclair is another scifi/romance . it 's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance , but set in a science fiction setting . captain elliot and her c-3po-type droid , named dezi , find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet . but the rescued man , rhis , is n't who he claims to be . and captain elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery . elliot seems to trust rhis even though he has lied to her , simply because she 's attracted to him . the technical jargon is a bit much , as are sinclair 's made up words and language . this book might have been easier to read ( and not as corny ) , if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many `` z 's '' and `` v 's . '' on the other hand , her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking . there was an alien species , but i have no idea what they looked like . and no one else , other than the two main characters , was described in any detail either . besides my criticisms , there was a good story underneath , though the ending seemed a bit abrupt
the film i bought at a retail outlet in spokane wa contains no closed captions ! if i had known that , i would n't have bought it . the box should have contained a clear message : no closed captions ! ( parenthetically , amazon.com 's description indicates the film is closed captioned . ) the content of the film is shallow , and it does n't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported greenwald film , walmart , the high cost of low price . if closed captions are not an issue , however , buy ( or rent ) * both * films to draw your own conclusion . obviously , the truth about walmart 's impact on us cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films . i found the greenwald film much more convincing
i 've ordered the collection with one thought in mind : ohh boy ! a good irish collection . i was astonished to hear synthesized ( ! ) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here , no bagpipes , no flutes ! only synthesized music ! this collection had much potential but it was killed ! not to mention the annoying rain sounds . ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly . bad
this is one of the most horribly muddled `` thrillers '' i 've ever read . by the end , i was n't sure who was `` winning '' or `` losing , '' nor did i really care . clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing . he should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on dirk pitt .
given high acclaims this film has collected over time , i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale . began to watch it last night . i was able to sit thru the part <NUM> . when the tape ended , i was actually glad . i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part <NUM> ! the movie is dreary to the max . people portrayed are irrational , lost , uncommunicative , and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers . in some way , this movie reminded me of the dreary winter ( lasting <NUM> months ! ) i spent in russia a couple of years ago ... to me , the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state ( 1920-1956 ) . for survivors , nothing made any sense anymore , except perhaps fear and evil , as people in this dreary film reflects . people have been already destroyed in their souls . they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience . maybe that is the real meaning of this movie . to really reflect what happened to people 's psyche after lenin and stalin 's unlimited terror , they found a parallel in mongol 's devastation and oppression of medieval russia . in both cases , people were left shattered , helpless , irrational , withdrawn , and autistic .
i love koontz ; however , this was not his best effort . the book was almost boring
patrick dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy , as did the characters he played . he was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in , somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance , but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end . here was no acception . he plays the lovable loser once again , this time he was an arrogant , cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college . disappointed and angry at his failing grades , his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place . while patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor , he encounters a beautiful , mysterious stranger who ( like the plot to a bad porn movie ) makes his job worth while with no strings attached . while this fleeting encounter might have ended there , the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this , and soon patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy . the smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that . long before desperate housewives he was their afternoon delight . what was amazing to me in watching this movie is that patrick did n't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires . he is simply a friend , a companion , someone to talk with . i guess i just do n't understand why some of the women he was servicing did n't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head . of course , as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did , it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving . that 's an urban ledgend if there ever was one . i gave this only <NUM> stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words . still , it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people
many of the reviews i read felt strongly in favor of this remake , but some of the people had not seen `` an affair to remember '' . cary grant & deborah kerr had the spark so lacking in this `` love affair '' remake . the original `` love affair '' with ( forgive me , i can only remember irene dunne as terry , and my opinion that film was not as good as this `` love affair '' , however . i missed hearing the original scoring of `` an affair to remember '' , but annette benning 's music with the children was lovely . as most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of `` an affair ... '' , i missed the climactic ending with cary grant 's reactions , and also the shipboard scene where he want 's to be `` worthy of her love '' . i do n't wish to underrate or `` dump '' on this film , but i wish all reviewers would watch the grant/kerr version just once . i believe they will become `` old movie buffs '' too . thanks for reading my review
i ordered this book because i really like to cook and love legumes and my pressure cooker . perhaps i should have looked elsewhere . the recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes . however , i found that there were too many southwestern chili type recipes for my taste . if you like to make chili and lots of mexican and southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you . that is not to say that there are n't some mediterranean and caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the tex-mex and southwestern flavors beat out the others . also , i happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs . i love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine . not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically , but diet margarine . in the same vein i understand that the author is an m.s. , r.d . but i really do n't think there is a need to use fat-free dressing for everything . i also did n't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix . i have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods . thus , i get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients . one more irksome tidbit was the fact that there were n't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi , adzuki , flageolet , cranberry to name a few . this cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your better homes and gardens cookbook can offer
i bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the <NUM> 49er superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much . they just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the superbowls and just highlights of the game itself . there is special features of some players like young and rice but they are just interviews from <NUM> and <NUM> that originally aired on espn years ago . nothing new is on here just old nfl films shows that they made for espn . very disappointed . they most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game . terrible
ick . i hated this cd . the first few songs were good , but the rest just sound like a motion picture soundtrack . what a waste of money
ken burns and company have assembled some classic parker takes , but the sound quality is dismal . yes , we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape , etc. -- i do n't think most people interested in parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound , but this is a disgrace . i have many c.p . recordings , including lots of old verve and savoy issues on lp -- none of them sound as bad as this cd . not just surface noise , but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today 's technology . i was suckered into this one by the burns affiliation , since i had enjoyed the tv jazz series . not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the cd . there is so much parker out there today put out with more care ; i would look to the dial and savoy sessions , for example
i 've seen ethan hawk 's best performance ever in this movie . it was great . wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie . it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me . maybe i 'm not right but in my opinion , this movie does not worth to buy . does not even worth to rent . but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it 's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally . it 's worth to be watch once at tv ! by the way , i forgot to mention that this movie has a great cd soundtrack , really great . worth to buy
seriously though , i tried to like this band but i cant do it . i felt like id heard every song before , and in case of 'loose lips ' i definitely had . i dont think ive ever seen such a blatant rip-off in my life . if i were thursday id be pissed . im not in thursday and im pissed
a few days ago i was delighted to learn the stepford wives would be shown on cable tv , but i soon realized i was watching a turkey . the opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the jerry springer show , and from that point it 's downhill all the way . the plot is weak , the characters inconsistent , and the story incoherent . the production values of casting , costuming and set design are certainly high . but that just makes this movie a pointless , glossy mess
this book has very little to teach you and it 's virtually unreadable . make sure you read one or two pages before you buy in case you are like me and you ca n't stand his style
this is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work charlap does on his three previous efforts at all . get any of those instead of this one . get stardust . get somewhere . get written in the stars . any and all of those three instead of this one . another warning ... this gershwin one has the annoying copy control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps . most annoying . whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music ? ? ?
tim lahaye , jerry jenkins , and others in the pre-trib circle , such as ed hindson , tommy ice , chuck missler , etc. , continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago . the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early church , and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming . these men are novices and not prophecy `` experts '' or `` scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination ; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians . why continue to be deceived ? tim cohen , in his excellent book , `` the antichrist and a cup of tea , '' provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now . not only that , the same author ( tim cohen ) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ : `` the real rapture '' . if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear tim cohen 's `` the real rapture '' ( based on a volume in his forthcoming `` messiah , history , and the tribulation period '' series ( see prophecy house 's web site , prophecyhouse dot com , for details on these items )
despite the cute sounding description , this is not a family movie . the constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine . the idea of the movie was a good one but once again hollywood messed it up . we were very disappointed and threw the video out .
there were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum . i can see doing maybe one song , two different ways . however , there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same
for those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a s/m relationship , i would highly suggest the japanese film , `` moonlight whispers '' over `` maitresse . '' that film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme , while `` maitresse '' is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a ( highly unlikely ) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix . the ex-con can not deal with `` her career '' eventually and threatens her to quit , etc . ( at some point , you get the idea that the director himself really does n't understand where the domina is coming from . ) what started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through . the writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection ( or pimp , for want of a better word ) . then , we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse , where a real horse is shown killed onscreen , strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly ( this image will upset you for weeks , believe me ! [ i feel like it 's my duty to warn you ! ] ) . and the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots . totally stupid ( like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas ) . believe me , i really wanted to like this movie . i ignored the negative reviews , because there are so few `` real '' films on this subject . but i was sorely disappointed and depressed by it . if you need to see this film , rent it . it 's definitely a `` one view '' film at best ; and it will be a film that will leave you angry ( because the horse scene ) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out . too bad . `` moonlight whispers '' is a much better , respectful treatment of s/m , a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological ( and sexual orientation ) questions , while also being a beautiful film to watch . that film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience !
now , i realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album . on `` know thy self '' , krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true . krs claims that any `` god '' that 's worshipped will lead you to heaven . think about that , allah , buddah , jesus , aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other ! only jesus deserves to be worshipped ! jesus is the son of god , he did die , and he 's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [ which every man and woman has ] . as for the cd , i wo n't lie , it sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [ t-bone , b.b . jay ] , and krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses , but when it comes down to it , krs still fails to acknowledge that jesus is the way , the truth , and the life . this cd gets <NUM> stars from me for the fact that at least krs is done dissing jesus [ something he did on every album after `` criminal minded '' and every album before `` the sneak attack '' ] and at least he still ai n't afraid to expose the problems of this world , but krs , if you 're reading this , i think you 're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept jesus into your heart . hope the review helped . be blessed .
maire brennan 's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful , and for most this can be rated a fabulous album . you need to understand , however , that this is a decidedly , in your face , unavoidably christian album . for those , like me , who are recovering from christianity , it was an unpleasant surprise , but not one for which i will fault or judge maire brennan . i just wish i had realized it before i had bought the album . it would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category
i was quite disappointed with ballast 's graphic division review . not only is the book itself sloppily laid out , and quite incomplete in regard to the information provided within it , there are much better alternatives out there . norman dorf 's `` solutions '' guide is a much better preparation guide , one that i wholeheartedly recommend to anybody about to tackle the are graphic exams
there was some great lines and the ending was funny . still , it was a movie spoofing about itself . it really was n't all that good . yes , plenty of celebrities . still so what ?
thinly veiled attempt to push politically correctness down the throats of our children , sacrificing the faith and beliefs of their elders in the attempt . are n't we so fortunate to have filmmakers to teach our children for us what their priorities and beliefs should be ? oh pleeeeze ! i 'm so glad i could watch this one with my daughter so i could point out the obvious attempts at manipulation . we discussed the issues , and thought for ourselves .
as an avid fan and owner of every book she 's published i was very disappointed in the storyline , plot , sub-plot , character development ( actually lack there of ) , dialog , i can go on . when the story moves into dream sequences it 's disjointed , choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour . i have n't finished the book , i have no desire , inclination or motivation to . i stopped reading the book a week ago and have n't felt the urge to pick it up again . i am barely 1/2 way through the book . i feel like i wasted money . i feel robbed
i gave this only one star as i did n't actually read it . i thought i was ordering books for my grand-daughter , but it turned out to be audio tapes . i paid over $ <NUM> . for it , but was only refunded $ <NUM> . extra fees were added that were n't there when i purchased . i wrote to amazon about not wanting a refund , but wanting the actual books , i got no response . i will never order from amazon again , i am very disappointed with the way this was handled
i 'm looking at reviews and people are saying , `` the movie is awful ! read the book . '' it 's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see , buti advise you not to read the book . it 's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache . if you 're in school and you 're required to read this book , i suggest you just watch the movie ( get the <NUM> hours and <NUM> minutes out the way ) and get cliff notes . for real , do n't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice
and this year 's crud-fest winner , the person who received the most votes from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching ..... who even cares anymore ? yet another drone pulled off the production line , this gimp being another in the long run of inoffensive handsome white boys , aimed primarily at stupid people and , judging by the popularity of this single , there are an awful , awful lot of . so let 's talk about the single . with the exception of the excrement that was last years winner ( steve brookstein , currently missing in action - yet another one-hit wonder who we 'll never see again ) first ( and only ) solo attempt - the dire phil collins cover , this is easily the worst actual attempt at a song yet . originally planned for westlife , `` that 's my goal '' was panned and rejected by them ( them ! westlife ! ) for being too weak , but it sure was n't weak enough for shayne ward , currently number one for the fourth week running as i type this . but what does that mean , exactly ? i 'll tell you - nothing . the general public are such idiots , such pathetic , `` tell us what to buy and we will '' easily led cretins , that they would buy anything after seeing it on a reality program . shayne ward could have released a record of him whistling the marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one . and it 's going to continue , is n't it ? this was a massive hit , the show was a massive hit , so we 're going to continue to be bombarded with bland , generic singers and pointless songs like this . if you bought this junk , or if you watched this junk , the curmudgeon holds you personally responsible . you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter masses , watching this easily-digestible pond-life program , and buying its cynical , disgusting products . one day , i hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television , where tv schedules and budgets are not ruled by programs aimed at the great unwashed , where the charts are not in the vice-like grasp of dire tv talent show winners ( and losers ) . that , ladies and gentlemen , that , is my goal . the_curmudgeon_hates_you @ yahoo.co.u
i do n't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful , with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to . john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he 's doing a ( bad ) imitation of michael crawford in & quot ; hello , dolly. & quot ; he does strange things to his words - i guess he 's trying not to sound british , but why is he singing & quot ; summ-ar weath-ar & quot ; instead of & quot ; summer weather & quot ; ? the ilona is a bass - almost literally . & quot ; i resolve & quot ; has been lowered for her , and yet she still can not master the range of the song . to accomodate her , the second part of & quot ; i do n't know his name & quot ; has a truly odd key change . were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing , but she 's not worth it . the orchestrations are odd , too , with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently . the rest of the singers range from fair ( kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression ) to bad ( mr. maraczek drags down every single note of & quot ; days gone by. & quot ; luckily this is his only song . ) the broadway revival , to my ear , still has the best voices , except , of course , that barbara cook ( the original ) outshines diane fratantoni , who is merely good ( but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout 's original amalia , the annoying judy kuhn . ) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans , or masochists . i 'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of & quot ; you 've got mail & quot ; than listen to this again
over the years i have had an avid interest in the paranormal . i have read books by numerous authors , and looked forward to this book being one of the best . i found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost , and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it . i have taken my law enforcement training and experience , and coupled it with other books on this subject , and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar . i am afraid that this book , apart from the poor spelling , and composition would be confusing to novice investigators , and would give them erroneous information , on a subject that is complicated to begin with . i am sure mr.taylor means well , but there are much better books out there for the beginner , or the experienced investigator . the later version is no real improvement eithe
the only book i 've ever read that i tore up and threw in the trash when i was finished . if this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there 's something seriously wrong with the world.this is a tragic , sad , grotesque , disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world . when a child is damaged it is never uplifting , whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes . this book is sickening . do n't buy it ! ! ! there are no animals only pain and death
my mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into christianity . i tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible . it was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book . in my personal opinion , the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of yitzhak rabin on many occasions , this seems to be his only method of proving that the `` bible code '' does in fact , exist . not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in god or prophecies . ' this gets very tiring . drosnin does not provide solid evidence , no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms . the author kills his credibility on repeated occasions . overall , i found this to be an interesting read , but the author 's arguements were not convincing enough for me .
there is no acting in this film . all it is is <NUM> minutes of conversation between three people which sometimes becomes so unbearable , that i wonder why i just didnt switch the movie off !
i 've loved jeanne ray 's other books ( julie & romeo , step ball change , and eat cake ) . i found them all to be well written , funny and entertaining reads , with varied and likeable characters . this book does n't come close to meeting the standard set by the others . it is n't funny at all . all of the characters act horribly , including the martyred julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her . i have n't read a book in a long time where i did n't like a single character . ( and i liked these people in the first book - julie and romeo ) . i highly recommend her other books , but i 'd stay away from this one
this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms ' story , and it 's hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children . even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale : the king threatens to kill the miller 's daughter if she ca n't spin gold from straw . rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her , but extracts a necklace , a ring and , on the third night of spinning , a promise of her firstborn . she then marries the king , whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome . when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn , rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name . she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name . so the king , though he looks good , is greedy and brutal . the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life , and then depends on an anonymous , unrecognized `` servant girl '' to save the child . and rumpelstiltskin , shown as physically unattractive and ( the message seems to be ) therefore bad , is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for . a weird , twisted story that offers nothing for kids , illustrated with renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad
i was sort of disappointed with this .... the recipes are not as diverse as i would have liked . more deserts and i was not interested in deserts . what could i do with gluten free bread ? i should have done more research before i ordered this
i have never been drunk enough to listen to this all the way through , but i have made everybody hit the door , even when there was liquor left , by putting on `` muskrat love . '' perfect for the thrifty college guy that wants to keep a few beers for tomorrow , or has already hooked up for the evening and wants the dorm room to himself
this is a copy of the review on amazon.com for van zant 's get right with the man which is another sony corrupted title . `` this cd secretly installs drm ( digital rights management ) software on your pc without your permission . not only does it do this , but the software then hides itself by installing as a `` root kit . '' as per wikipedia , -- root kit from wikipedia , the free encyclopedia . a root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system . these tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes . root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as linux , solaris and versions of microsoft windows . a rootkit typically hides logins , processes , files , and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals , network connections , and the keyboard . in many sources , rootkits are counted as trojan horses . -- in this instance , sony installs drm software to copy protect their cd , and prevent it from being copied to various devices , all the while not telling you , the user , or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and windows . manually trying to uninstall it like some people have done , results in their cd-rom drives disappearing entirely from windows , as sony installs their own custom cd-rom drivers onto the system . do not support this wreckless kind of copy protection . show the music business this is * your * music . * you * purchased it , and they should * not * be able to dictate how you can use it . do not buy this cd. `` a list of affected titles can be found here : http : //www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004144.php and another part of an amazon.com review for the van zant cd `` amazon rocks . they pulled they infected cd 's from sale and allowed these reviews that tell of the problems . shame on sony they not only messed with the consumers but also the artists .

this movie is strickly for the women now i see why it was made for the lifetime channel . it was hard for me ( as a man ) to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters . i was looking for a happy ending and did n't get it .
i was just overall very dissapointed . i tried to make myself listen to this album but i could only do so a couple times before i gave up . i thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer kool keith or mf doom or gang starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists
i was excited about this dvd because of the customized workout feature , but i could n't even make it through a preview . the instructor 's voice is grating . she sounds similar to denise austin so if you , like me , are sensitive to voice tone : be warned . and then there 's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which , to my mind , is entirely wrong for a yoga routine . if you 're looking for a yoga dvd with a customized workout feature , i 'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed `` yoga shakti '' by shiva rea
i must admit i am more than shocked to read some of these reviews . all those that have n't seen the original starring robert donat et al simply have n't lived . some scenes have been completely desecrated . the donat `` liar and a thief '' questioning scene of the young winslow , is one of the best in movie making history . the equivalent in this remake is so weak that even 'sir roberts ' attending solicitor also lends a hand in the questioning ! however it may have been david mamets intention not to even to attempt to try and emulate . likewise 'sir roberts ' courtroom speech was completely missed . beg , steel or borrow the origianl vhs copy , and if need be go out and buy a vcr just to watch and enjoy this gem . if there is a movie studio lobby somewhere to get 'essentials ' like this released on dvd i 'll join it ! ! ! !
if you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be terrible . it can never be as good as the original . also snoop dogg screwes up in gangsta gangst
this movie 's only redeeming quality is the visual effects ... as an artist , i have to admire their efforts . but other than that , the movie is just unwatchably bad . there just is n't a coherent plot . the movie jumps from place to place , throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen . every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering , another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion . add in bad acting , awful `` humor '' , and you 'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through
this is a `` horror '' movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage . i do n't mean the acting is garbage , though it is . i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage , such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them . if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a one-man murder wave , then ... bingo . i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat .... blow away the cast
quigley was a georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early <NUM> 's to the private archives of the committee on foreign relations , a rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the trilateral commission and the royal institute of international affairs . it is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate . there is no continuity to the book ; nothing ties together quigley 's version of the past and of the future . it 's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up . you are left wondering , what is the point ? we are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling , but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past . quigley 's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda . quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history , and he is even worse at sociology . he touts inclusive diversity as our great strength and greatest gift . perhaps he should have considered the aphorism , `` divide and conquer . '' the west , or any other empire , can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern , not divisivness quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy , which are more in his area of expertise . he correctly observes that british and american `` victories '' in wwi and wwii resulted in the almost total destruction of international law . quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states . as globalization unfolds , quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling , yet he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan . so , what is the point of all of this costly meddling ? quigley predicts success ... and then failure . `` we shall undoubtedly get a universal empire in which the u.s. will rule most of western civilization . this will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of western culture . '' could n't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business ? minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government , and that we have a choice . however , quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments . quigley says that the internationalists , who prefer to remain in the background , should be known for their `` valuable '' contributions . what these contributions amount to is that they want world government , and they intend to cram it down everyone 's throats . as we slouch toward financial , industrial , and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties . `` as economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another , the freedom , individualism , and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed . '' quigley acknowledges that in our future , `` in general , there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world , with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past . '' to add to this loss of freedom , quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of christianity ! his version of christianity , of course . still full of contradictions , quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes , approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of christianity . finally , as we follow our present course , quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle , war , irrationality , and declining progress . obviously , we 're there now . rather than attack his sponsors , who are bringing us this new world order , quigley vents his frustration on the middle class . quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor , but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed , neurotic , bourgeois , radical-right republicans . worst of all , they have puritanical attitudes toward sex . the many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker . the author 's history is mostly stale propaganda , spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles . maybe if quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books , he would have had something coherent to say . in this book , quigley 's conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book . this effort spanned <NUM> years , and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author .
has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song ? of all of the bands of the 90s , nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands . and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation . instead , we are treated to the worst of the consumerist , disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer . a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time , but this album falls short in every aspect .
i , too , thought turner 's latest book was a bit on the boring side and not as good as her other books . i found myself annoyed at the poetry throughout the book and thought it took away from the story of which was already hard to follow . i did laugh a bit , but mostly from the fact that it seemed doubtful the author really had a notion of the subject in which she was writing
this man lives in a world od distorted reality . economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production . capitalism allows democracy , which is the most important issue to me . he talks about cuba in this book ... the have to give up freedom and live in poverty , but their literacy level is the same as our 's ; which system sounds better ? tjis was a well written book wth ample information , so i probably should have rated it better . however , i hate the message that it sends
i was at scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album . there were lots of great moments in that concert ... unfortunately , none of them made it onto the album . it 's like they took only the dull parts of the concert . the studio portions are n't much better . i 'm a huge fan of danilo perez and john patittucci but this album is really boring
puddle of mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around <NUM> . this album is representative of their entire catalogue . for those music fans who want to hear true hard rock , pick up a good copy of any early led zeppelin or black sabbath . for anyone wanting true grunge , pick up any copy of an alice in chains , soundgarden , or nirvana album . puddle of mudd shamelessly ( and inaccurately ) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge , while living up to neither . since most of their fans seem to be pretty young , they 've been able to pull this sham off , mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands ... and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music . the songs on this album are extremely redundant , with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next . the lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content . this album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock
as others have noted , the & quot ; charlie brown suite & quot ; is a ponderous , overblown arrangement of charlie brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation . noises from the audience ( squeaking chairs , etc . ) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite . according to the liner notes , guaraldi 's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats . the selections here are from the collection of pianist george winston , a guaraldi fan . i hope the remaining material , which he hopes to issue in the future , is better than this . the three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting ; however , if you 're looking for peanuts music , you 'd be much better off sticking with the three other guaraldi charlie brown cds currently available
albert hourani 's a history of the arab peoples is a widely regarded general history of the arab world . this is too bad , since as history the book is of low quality , with significant problems of organization and , where relevant to hourani 's apparent biases , factual accuracy . it does have its redeeming elements , but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the arab world , especially for the beginner . being the author of a general history of the arab world myself , before i explain why i evaluate the book negatively i would like to suggest some alternatives , lest i be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest . philip k. hitti 's the history of the arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-islamic times to the 19th century . arthur goldschmidt 's concise history of the middle east covers turkey , iran and israel as well as the arab world and is well-organized for beginners . it was the first general history of the middle east i read as an undergraduate . bernard lewis ' the middle east focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region . this book was first published in <NUM> . this review is based on the <NUM> paperback version by warner books . the initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter ; although containing <NUM> pages of main text , hourani 's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-islamic period . this is pretty amazing , for anyone familiar with that period , since arab history prior to islam is roughly as long as arab history after it . exactly how far back arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute , but certainly there were people one could call `` arabians '' as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium bc , or 1,600 years prior to muhammad . the evidence is sporadic for sure , and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times , but seven pages is pretty paltry . one might suspect an islamic bias here , but the problem continues in the key early periods of islam . the life of muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the muslim world , spanning about a half century from muhammad 's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor ali , get only <NUM> pages . the first arab empire , the umayyads ( 661-950 ) , gets seven pages , and the abbasid empire ( 750-circa . <NUM> ) , which is usually thought of as the `` golden age of islam , '' gets only six . this means <NUM> pages for the first 2,000 years of arab history , including its framing epoch , and over <NUM> pages for the next 1,000 . this would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion . what makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization . the middle time period between the collapse of abbasid authority - roughly ad <NUM> - and the ascendance of the ottoman empire over the arab world in <NUM> is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history . this is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states , there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of sunni and shia , arab , persian and turkic ruling groups , not to mention the latin states . hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to <NUM> to a topical one . there are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods ( the umayyads and the abbasids ) . there is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time . if you want to understand the relative historical roles of the buyids , the fatimids , the zengids , the ayyubids , the mamluks and their contemporaries , read something else . it is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its `` social history , '' or its description of the development of the arab world . in fact i cited hourani on the social history sections of my own book . in this regard , hourani really is better than the alternatives . over <NUM> pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the arab world came to be prior to the ottomans . so for those who have already read a general history of the middle east or the arab world and want a more specialized knowledge , these chapters are quite useful . i have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest . this book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of arabs and muslims , to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the arab world which might be interpreted negatively . the word `` jihad '' does n't even have an entry in the index , although it is used , or perhaps , misused . on page <NUM> , hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation `` to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom 's defense ... '' this gives a misimpression , because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of muslim lands and the muslim community 's collective obligation to spread islam through conquest . although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application , its use is overwhelmingly in the military context , and while muhammad 's battles probably could be described as defensive , the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations ( the christian counter-offensives known as the crusades being a major exception ) . more broadly , the single most influential islamist movement of the modern age , the wahhabis , get only a few scattered mentions , and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by <NUM> had been felt for some time . the primary non-islamist ideological influence , marxism , is discussed of course , but the influence of nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out . nazi germany is mentioned once in passing , and in the same paragraph on page <NUM> palestinian leader amin husseini is mentioned , but it is n't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of nazis , that he moved to germany during the second world war and played an active role in the holocaust , or that despite this he was made leader of the palestinian cause by the nascent arab league after the war . hourani 's account of the <NUM> is incredibly inaccurate , giving the impression that egypt engaged in some bluster and then israel started the war . he mentions nasser 's demand that the un clear out of the suez canal zone , and includes the defense pact with jordan , but omits a key fact - the mobilization of egyptian forces in the sinai . once egypt did this , israel had no choice but to attack , because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization , while egypt could . hourani also does n't mention the statements by arab leaders to the effect that all jews would be wiped out in the coming war . on the whole , this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern . otherwise , i do not recommend buying it
you want some real metal/tribal sounds stick with soulfly ! this cd is pure garbage ..
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes . it gets stuck or restarts itself . very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
this book does nothing but help the author make a quick buck by playing on people 's fears . i * am * a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol , but i think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor ( hopefully you have a good doctor ) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process . this book has some `` common sense '' information but also a lot if misinformation , such as the stuff on supplements . none of them has been shown to really work ! do n't waste your money . talk to your doctor first , and be sure to find out if your parents also have high cholesterols and let your doctor know
completely worthless ! if you liked the film , go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities . the sound quality is fair at best , even for a live album . almost every track is jammed with totally worthless ` commentary ' at the beginning or end of the song . the ` commentary ' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason . it would have been nice if they had put these ` commentaries ' on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear . the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees , which means no ` killing me softly ' . sadly , you can tell that most of the artists on this album have n't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible , even for a live recording . some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl
this is the favorite book of a friend of mine , she rereads it every year . she chose it for our bookclub , and the rest of us hated it ! i think this is the best example i know of a book that either really connects with you , or does n't at all . i have a degree in eng . lit . and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that i loved , but this one was for me rambling , full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and , since i did n't like a single character , i never felt invested in anything that happened to them . for others what was tedium for me , was poetry . i made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub , but it was like taking medicine -- still i can see that every word was a joy for my friend . this is n't a matter of being good or bad , its obviously a masterpiece for some , but if it is n't your kind of writing , you will find it more than a chore to get through
hello ? ? ? ? ? whoever mastered this great film ruined it by forgetting or refusing to provide english subtitles for the japanese and italian characters . how can such a thing happen ? if you find the vhs buy it . maybe some day someone will make the corrections . until then , avoid this dvd
i 'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing , feminist agenda . ms. harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of latin textbooks , and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing `` gender-specific historical tidbits '' which she calls `` hysteria 's herstory . '' ( something tells me that does n't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended . ) likewise , what ms. harwood refers to as `` the christian church '' of the so-called dark ages is in reality the catholic church . presumably , the correct identifier did n't sit well with her progressive sensibilities . for an agenda-free discourse on latin , get the dummies book or stick with wheelock 's latin 6e
the numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews . political correctness and post cold war jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie . some of the historic elements ( like stalin 's `` not one step back '' order , etc ) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes , creating an anachronistic mess . unfortunately , there are n't many soviet perspective films on stalingrad to choose from . would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that 's not from the `` usual '' u.s. or german wwii perspective . would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines
i have read all of patricia cornwell books and love them all . except this one . i just liked it . it was okay . not what i 've come to expect from one of my favorite authors . i was excited to see that there were new characters and i did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them . however the whole story did not develop very well , and it left me feeling like i missed a whole bunch of the 'potential ' story . i ended the book feeling like ms. cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story . very disappointed .
fortunately i was given a copy otherwise i probably would have wanted my money back . i did n't read anything beyond common sense advice and questionable opinions
<NUM> stellar reviews of this , i am flabbergasted . i looked this up because we were talking about it on a messageboard : patrick posted this on aug 25th , <NUM> at 09:59:53 am this looks and sounds ill in a conceptual way , it does n't sound like steppenwolf , right ? peter * * * * * * * * * * isdead posted this on aug 25th , <NUM> at 05:56:23 pm steppenwolf have a few bangers , c'mon and one of the best lp covers ever - [ image ] i cant find a good size pic of it but if you own it you know perfect 70s dirtbag vibe on the cover the_real_ * * * * * posted this on aug 25th , <NUM> at 07:11:16 pm that steppenwolf-monster lp has songs called fag , monster and suicide , has the best cover art ever and it still totally sucks . negative * * * posted this on aug 25th , <NUM> at 07:56:21 pm i was all stoked when i picked up monster at a garage sale . i owned it for less then <NUM> hours before i put it in the trash . the cover is great though . youth * * * * * * posted this on aug 25th , <NUM> at 09:18:05 pm those song titles ( steppenwolf ) are incredible beyond belief . diffr n't strokes i gues
with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie , but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down . matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance , yet does n't stray too far from what he knows best . there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers . patton oswalt appears in a blink and you 'll miss him scene , but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who 's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play . bates is great as mcconaughey 's mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker 's flatmate . parker should stick to television , she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role , maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie . a good date movie flick , the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained . special features are nothing too special . a trailer and a few dodgy featurette 's . a rainy night rental movie
i saw barrage last night . they 're not great dancers , and they 're not great musicians . the music is just loud , new age , junk , similar to what i imagine yanni or john tesh probably plays
i expected this book to be about the freshman year experience , based on the title and the way that the book began . however , the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life . the author did not live in a freshman residence hall and i am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not . memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college ( cut corners ) as a stragegy to manage their time
you win some and you lose some . this purchase was a definite loss . what a dissapointment
having enjoyed kellerman 's delaware stories , i happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias . it is astounding how often the arabs , turks , bedouins , muslims are described as `` sweat stained , '' `` filthy , '' `` lazy '' and `` shiftless . '' the idiot arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical . the israelis are always industrious , clean , eager to do the job . the `` good '' arab detective , mahoud , is n't even muslim -- he 's christian ! the description of the <NUM> and <NUM> wars are difficult to consume , knowing the complexity of the issues then . this was an old ( <NUM> ) book , and one hopes that kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories
i purchased this book thinking that it would have good ways to make my boring room look a bit interesting , but i , as a thirteen-year-old , was n't impressed with the ideas in the book . condratitory to what the author says , the projects were not fun , not cheap , not for a teen audience , not interesting , and not a good addition to your room whatsoever . the four themes in this book , which include flowers , teddy bears , funky , and nature , all look as if they were made for the ten-and-under age group . i mean , seriously , what teen devotes their whole room to teddy bears and decorate every inch with the strange projects in this book ? the ideas for the projects are unoriginal , strange , and lame . for example , some of the ideas suggests that you splatter your bedroom wall with multi-colored paints , make a scrunchie holder out of a recycled soda bottle , put a headboard behind your bed that says `` i love teddy bears , '' and so on . yeah , i know , it 's stupid and immature . so if you want a good book that will give you some good room decorating project ideas , definitely stay clear of this one !
for me , my low rating of this film might be , at least in part , the result of having wrong expectations about it . i had heard this film described as 'charming ' and 'funny , ' and was expected a comedy , albeit a somewhat black one . but despite the good acting , this film left a sour taste in my mouth . it is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about . i am an avid foreign language film buff , but i could not see the merit in this crude , hate-ridden and depressing story .
this movie goes way off the unintentional comedy scale . a rag-tag group of survivors , containing every possible patented hollywood character , from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all wasp and the fiesty token minority , are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the poseidon adventure look like citizen kane . my favorite part of this film is the invincible dog . you can always tell a hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog , which always survives everything and is , gosh , just so darn * cute * that you 're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits . a classic example is the golden retriever in independence day that , in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening , somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed los angeles .. and of course just at the last moment . a cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here , where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant , but is just flat out funny . it 's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people , but you 've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device
joe camp should hang his head in shame for making this piece of trash . i assumed it would be good because he has made good clean family films before . this ai n't one of them . this film has indecency in it and is not fit for family viewing . do n't waste your time or money
i have schimmel 's first cd , & quot ; comes clean , & quot ; which is absolutely hilarious . so , i ordered this cd and waited for it to arrive with much anticipation . as soon as i received it , i could n't wait to listen to it with my husband , also a fan of the first cd . unfortunately , we barely snickered throughout the entire cd . maybe because his style was no longer new to us
this dvd barely worked and did n't do any good . this might be good if your potty training a boy . it is very boy oriented . they need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls . how can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training , they are not the same
i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that . having said that i did not like this book : <NUM> ) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times . i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis ' point . <NUM> ) the story lacked the depth of lewis ' other wonderful books - where 's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball ( and others ) educational - i wanted the story behind the story . <NUM> ) who were all the pictures of ? i found them distracting ... i 'll continue to read lewis ' books bu thope the next one is bette
i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd . we were barely able to make it through one listening . this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist ( using the term very loosely ) not already been famous for something besides music . the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling . it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating . i want my money back
a very intricate , involved thriller about a special effects man , an expert in disguise , and a plan to fake the death of a mafia kingpin who is about to talk to the authorities . all kinds of double dealings are going on here ; in fact , so much story is going on with so little attention to character development that after it 's over it all quickly begins to evaporate from your memory . quickly forgettable . bill conti wrote the music , which is interesting
i bought this set because i was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started , and boy am i sorry i bought this . the narrator is bad , the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive , and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting . even at six times the price i recommend buying ken burns ' `` baseball '' documentary , by far the best thing i 've ever seen about baseball . but if an <NUM> hour documentary is too much for you to watch , then i would recommend the `` when it was a game '' series . anything but `` baseball 's greatest legends - diamond memories '' . this set is so bad that i was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and i have n't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it . please , save yourselves the money and most importantly the time . do not buy this
this novel started out pretty good in that i did n't know where koontz was going with martie 's panic attacks and fear of herself . it seemed to take forever for anything to actually happen . the antagonist was a caricature . so over-the-top , it was a job getting through each page . if this had been my first koontz novel , i probably would n't bother with a second .
bryson is a pretty good writer . his prose is flowing and very easy to read . this book is <NUM> pages and i read it in <NUM> days . my complaint is his lousy attitude toward people . he made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman . plus , this is a book about traveling across america . i do n't mind americans complaining about what 's wrong here . i do it myself occasionally . i do n't mind people in other countries criticizing the usa . i make judgments about other countries , some unflattering . but there is something grating about americans living in other countries coming back to travel the usa and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor . stay in england if it 's so bad here
here 's the thing -- i wanted to learn the story of isolde and that is why i picked up this book in the first place . i have read one other miles book ( i , elizabeth ) and that was n't very impressive but i thought i 'd give isolde a try . it was painful ! miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly . her characters are very poorly developed . also , the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking , 'wait ! where the heck did that come from ? ' after reading this book , i could n't decide if i was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak , unskilled writing .
i like this album , especially the 10th song & quot ; crime of the century & quot ; . this song is fun , and i like it . i typed the lyrics on my computer . in august <NUM> i sang the song at the boys and girls club staff member . some of the staff members like this song . i hope i will sing this song at school if there is a talent show at schoo
i am very dissapointed with this album , it has not the mistyc of vnv . i suppose that this was only a mistake of these musician stars . i will wait the next release .
i found this movie to be awful ! the pace could 've been kicked up , enabling the movie to flow together more cohesively . the scenes seemed to be disjointed , one minute here , the next minute there , but it did n't alleviate the drag of the story line . while it did capture the feel of the nfl , the uniforms , the people working on the sidelines , the coaches etc . the movie floundered when it attempted to get an important point across . this could 've been put together so much better
hofstede 's work was and is not really helpful ; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country . for all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec . asian behavior and cultural differences , i highly recommend to start with : `` the geography of thought : how asians and westerners think differently ... and why -- by richard nisbett '' . that 's the stuff that will bring you where hofstede could never dream to be
patrick swayze worst movie ever you hardly ever seen him in the movie pluse you had to read the whole thing , forest whitaker scene 's was probobly the best thing about the movie maybe this movie would of been much better without the letter box verson and that 's a big mayb
this book is analagous to buying a new elliptical , anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you , only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life . the author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments , but he is so caught up in the technical details that `` the transformation of our consciousness '' is brushed aside as an afterthought . instead , the author drones on and on and on about monuments , angles , precessions , measurements etc . it 's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come , but this book never builds on that foundation . there were brief moments when i thought the book started to get really interesting , but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical , newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled , `` who gives a [ ... ] . '' john major jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject , and if you do n't believe me , i quote page <NUM> of this book ... '' as a reminder , my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on earth . '' my question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it 's hardly mentioned in the book ? you would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus , since after all , it 's what most of us should be most concerned with . if you are preparing for a test in astronomy , this book is for you . <NUM> stars for the misleading title .
i find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented d.j . to round up <NUM> bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar ; ripping off the kids droned and purged on the mtv feedbag , and this man paul wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them . notice his rhymes do n't descend any futher than his mouth , his car and his money . what excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me ? does it reach artistic heights ? or is it just another jackass looking for his <NUM> minutes of fame ? and still people eat it up like chicken n dumplin 's on a cold winter 's day this is excactly whats very wrong with today 's hip hop , it 's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely stay away from this awful garbage do n't let mtv rob another cen
two of the short stories in this book , `` running out of dog '' and `` gone down to corpus '' are not new stories . running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr. l. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people . but , it should have been noted that <NUM> % of this book is not original . the others are average reads , over before we have any understganding of the characters mr. lehane writes so well about . none of the others are full of tension , irony , comedy , tragedy , and suspense we 've all come to expect . they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author 's excellent reputation . we waited a long time for another lehane . this book certainly does not showcase his talents
this is the worst work out tape i 've ever purchased ... its a waste of money ... there is nothing latin about this tape .. and her moves are so repetitive ... u wo n't even work up a sweat however the viva latin rhythm work out was excellent ... highly recomende
uninspired and down right boring . i feel i wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc ..
ok , people , here 's some advice before you think about buying this book . do n't just look at all the <NUM> and <NUM> star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from lowest rank first and read all the <NUM> star reviews as well . that way you can really get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into . sure , in both the high reviews and the low reviews there 's just basic no-brainer reviews - `` it 's great ! ! '' or `` its sucks ! ! '' but amongst all the one star reviews i discovered some smart punters whom i should have read before buying the damn book myself . yup , i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews i realise that some reviewers had duly warned me . this book is terrible . it gives only the scantiest of basics on body language , stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write . and the photos - my god ! its mr steele with his wife and their friends , posing away in their garish shirts and shorts ... these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for `` flirting '' and `` body language '' i 've ever ever seen . and in his blurb photo at the front of the book he 's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there 's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that i find highly disturbing . yucko . as others have said , if i could give this book a zero star rating , i would . avoid , everyone , avoid like the plague .
lover 's lane .... another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible . lover 's lane is the hot spot to where you wan na go to make out but <NUM> years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and <NUM> years later , some relatives of the people who were murdered up there ( always is ) are tormented in the present but the `` hook man '' from the urban legend . pretty much a snoozer with bad acting ( who calls this acting good ? ) . how many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies ? it only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie . the plot twists and turns arent even that great .... idiotic writing . starring : riley smith ( radio , <NUM> legged freaks ) , erin j . dean ( lolita , a pig 's tale ) , suzanne bouchard ( joyful partaking ) , sarah lancaster ( four kings , dr. vegas ) , diedre kilgore ( good luck , the falls ) , billy o'sullivan ( a change of heart , rites ) , matt reidy ( hit and run , carried away ) and anna faris ( scary movie 1-4 , just friends ) in one of her earlier movies . nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff .... it 's ridiculous
i do n't like dj clue , i do n't like jay-z , i do n't like memphis bleek but i do like methodman not redman.this cd is not worth buying , i did n't even buy it i heard it from a friend.this album is nothing but junk
although this electronic atlas has all the netter plates , and quite a few nice new ones , as well as some radiographic views , it is nearly unusable in practice . the images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible . the program can only display images at <NUM> x <NUM> x <NUM> colors , regardless of your monitor or video card ( it even says so right in the documentation ) . part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar , so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than <NUM> . if you estimate a typical plate to be <NUM> & quot ; x <NUM> & quot ; , that works out to maybe <NUM> dpi . many of the smaller features on the original art can not be seen on tne electronic version , and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going . the quality does not change when you print or zoom in . all the other bells and whistles , like the study lists , searching , etc . just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful . and the user interface is terribly archaic , nonstandard , and hard to use . the font for the lables is horrible . also , i 'm not sure i like the pronunciation of the speaking feature : & quot ; pec-tor-ay-lis major & quot ; ? if you have the cash to spare , it makes a nice toy , but it is not worth the price
this album was recommended to me by several different sources , including amazon and my local record store , which had `` mandatory indie classic '' in a sticker on the disc . i tried it out a couple of times and mangum 's voice just takes away from everything else for me . i just could not get into this `` experience '' and traded the disc back in . i agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody . if you can get over the vocals , by all means enjoy this album . as for me , the vocals were just too much , or maybe not enough
when i bought this book i thought i was getting a simple living book about how to cook beans . i guess i should have read more about it in amazon , but it reminds me of 1960s hippy commune vegetarian cooking . not what i had in mind . a lot of soy , tofu , honey and all that . i wish someone would write a book about plain cooking that uses beans and meat
got it for the kids . after watching the first few , everyone agreed that we should not have purchased it . good story , but too much gender content . gets young kids thinking about what is underneath the clothing ... sad
whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people . but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few of them seem to have jobs ) and party all day . the main character ( sid ) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism ) . the film appeals to naive youth
given the fact that this film has no soundtrack , i can only give it two stars . it is a bit too silent to enjoy
this book had quite a number of scholarships listed , but some of them were of no use to 99.9 % of the population of college students . if i was interested in attending generic college , usa , and i wanted to know what scholarships they offered , i would go to that college and ask them . i would n't look it up in a general college scholarship book . thus it was frustrating when college-specific scholarships were listed for some schools , but not all . some of the listings were outdated , and i felt like i had to read through the whole book to make sure i did n't miss any scholarships i was eligible for . i sent out about ten letters to different scholarship opportunities , and not all of them were responded to , and of those that replied and to whom i submitted applications to , no money was won . thus i was not very happy with my purchase
my understanding of theoretical and practical physics ( pick your subdiscipline ) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans . but i do know a good book when i read one . unfortunately , gregory benford 's cosm was not one of them . if he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists , or to critique the workings of the scientific community , essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book . all of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world , but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action . the characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today 's universities ( the novel is set in <NUM> ) . the clichés make an early appearance with `` this far out from the city , people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of coors and a bug zapper '' ( p. <NUM> ) and continue throughout . all of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an `` upscale fungus '' and see industrial park developments `` crouched down , as if ashamed . '' benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances . in brief , a particle accelerator experiment of the main character , alicia , results in the accidental creation of the cosm , a universe which can be observed ( sometimes directly , sometimes not ) from inception to death throes . she is ( unthrillingly ) kidnapped and escapes . she displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood . and she finds love where she never thought to look .
this was certainly not one of cornwell 's best works . it was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one . it read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel
i read about this book in a catalog , i was intrigued , so i ordered a copy . the book arrived today i read through it and found it to be quite ordinary . it was n't a smooth read . very choppy . not inspiring in fact it was somewhat depressing . i was very disappointed . i will return the book to the catalog company today for a refund . save your money and look elsewhere for life changing book
maybe it 's just me and i 'm expecting so much when i spend my money or a little bit of time listenin ' to these new n * ggas . but i 'm just not feelin ' this s * it here . i fell asleep mid way through this album . i just ca n't seem to understand why these n * ggas is so one dimesional . i cant underdstand why people still supportin ' these n * ggas . not one track was tolerable . if dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s * it away already . word of advice dont buy this .
candace bushnell wrote `` lipstick jungle '' from the perspective of three different narratives : wendy , the movie executive , nico , the editor of chief of bonfire magazine and victory , the fashion designer . at times it gets sort of confusing who is who and the reader is left with the feeling that the author had three good ideas for three new books and somehow put them all in one . it is interesting however , to see selden rose , a character from `` trading up '' , reappear in this novel , good to know that he has recovered from the failed marriage to janey wilcox . all in all the relationship between the three main characters remains unclear throughout the entire book , they just seem to be acquainted with each other for no apparent reason , occasionally talk or lunch together and talk about their individual lives .
`` the day the world went away '' was the leadoff single from `` the fragile '' and is of minimal value to all but collectors . two of the tracks on this are taken straight from `` the fragile '' ( with small adjustments , one 's slightly shorter , one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in ) , with the third ( a remix ) also being available on part two of the `` we 're in this together '' singles . but looking at the songs themselves -- `` the day the world went away '' is fantastic -- bleak , moody , with a great loud-soft interplay , a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from reznor , and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end . the quiet mix is worthwhile , with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano , in many ways it works better than the album mix , but its a bit overlong . i 'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better , the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece . `` starf * * * ers , inc '' is a rather popular song amongst fans , but i 've always found it to be a bit dull -- the verses are nice enough , with a great beat , and there 's some interesting guitar work on the piece , but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing . material aside , unless you 're a completionist , you can skip this one
it is a fact that the human race originated in africa . it is also a fact that civilization originated in the middle east . so what
this is no saw 85-92 as some people compare it to . oh , no . this is a largely unfulfilling listen . the tracks all sound too similar . i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear , but the drum programming and harmonic `` development '' is lackluster . only track worth burping over is the last one ... xmd something . has he been taking piano lessons since druqks ? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch , check out nick forte 's new release `` young man 's disease '' which is better than anything else i 've heard this year .
if you are familiar with modular knitting , this book offers nothing new . the patterns did n't appeal to me at all ; there was no snap to the designs . if you are n't familiar with modular knitting , there are better books from which to learn
i would not even give this book one star if i had a choice ! although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading , and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a different exam , it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam . the book should have been titled `` some really really basic windows server infrastructure info and just barely scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam ! '' the book was short and easy reading and i aced all the questions at the end of each chapter . but when i took a real practice test by selftest software , i got <NUM> questions out of <NUM> correct on my first try . not a good start for the exam which i wanted to take next week . the questions on the practice test that i got wrong were not even covered in any respect in the book . i 've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and i can tell you that i know what to expect from a book and from the ms tests and this book does almost nothing for you in regards to the exam . sure , it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info , but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam , skip this one . i am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a real book !
let 's get one thing strait : i am deffidently not a punk hater , and deffidently not an mtv loser fan . in fact , punk rock is my favorite type of music . but i did not like punk o rama volume <NUM> . i just did not find it cool , catchy , or even ok . it sucked . the only songs i really liked were the pennywise song and the vision song ( which is about being close minded , and i do n't like people who are close minded ) , and the pulley song was okay , though the singer 's voice annoys the heck outta me . the rest is bland , unoriginal , and annoying . even the rancid song was annoing . yes , you heard me right . everyone 's so-called favorite punk band 's song was annoying . at borders , i had the choice between this and afi 's all hollows e.p . i now know better than that . if you liked this cd , fine . just remember to buy good punk cds from bands like the distillers , misfits , the ramones , offspring , rise against , and early afi , out of respect for good punk
a catalyst for the civil war , uncle tom 's cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves . the book 's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out , and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the african american 's pain , despite being redundant , rube and rife with tautology . the story is about tom , a slave who saves his master 's daughter and is promised his freedom . but his master dies before tom is actually freed . the family falls upon hard times and tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named simon legree . legree tried everything to degrade tom , but tom holds firmly to his religious convictions .
at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr . i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd . at the time this album was realeased , hank jr. was riding high , winning big at the cma 's and acm 's . he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career . but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll . to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert . the only difference is he did n't botch the vocals as he does on his live show . the music is decidedly <NUM> % not country , it drifts towards eighties rock . if you trace hank jr. 's recording career , you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of . i must say though , this cd contains one of hanks last top <NUM> hits , `` if the south woulda won , '' which is an hard to find recording on his compilations . i 'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise , just because of that song .
i bought i and ii of this released wolf 's rain because when i first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending . i am sooooooooooooo disappointed because now that i have the second part there is no alternate ending and i now see that that review has been deleted . i think amazon handled this whole thing very poorly . we depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices
very disappointing , it 's just old recordings rehashed onto a new cd and i heard that leann who is a wonderful singer did n't even have any say about this cd being released ! also there are n't enough patriotic songs ! i really hope that leann makes a new cd of all newly recorded patriotic songs and another one that is all inspirational gospel songs
this book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today . the yi jin jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever . neither is the shaolin <NUM> animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions . i do n't care what the history of the manuscripts are , this book offers no definitive information . it is very vague and elementary , a lot like smith 's other books . the fighting methods shown are a poor representation of shaolin skills . the true essence of shaolin is beyond any manuscript , let alone a hoax manuscrpit from taiwan , which is the inspiration for this book
if you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and bb major share the note d as their third , you would do far better to consult a decent recording of beethoven 's hammerklavier sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity
somewhere in the universe , statistically speaking , there has to be a band more stultifying than rush . it 's hard to imagine that god could be so cruel , but remember , she gave us boston ( the band , that is ) too . this stuff is so painful , it almost makes rap sound good
as a lover and avid collector of books , i had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing , especially the topic . unfortunately , once i started reading it more carefully , my spirits sank . some of the pictures are visually interesting , but most are not . even more disappointing , there is not much substantive information either . if you like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read , check out at home with books : how booklovers live with and care for their libraries by estelle ellis ( editor ) , et al . that book is worth every penny , and you 'll enjoy it
i guess albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but i 'm done with him . at least i can say i never paid for any of his oprahlit . just wasted time at a library . please do n't make this huckster one cent richer . buy something more edifying . like toilet paper
a work of fiction is a great thing , but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong . why not just make up a story with no historical basis
a thin soup of potty humor , fart jokes , and juvenile cheap laughs . you know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you have n't even cracked a smile . good gawd , dustin hoffman sitting on the toilet ? robert deniro breastfeading a baby ? foreskin dropped into a fondue pot ? wow , a movie that hurt to watch . it was n't even worth renting for free from the public library .
i bought this dvd a while back from amazon . i was very disappointed with the dvd . it 's a joke ! , really . he was worse than the beginner dancer . i watched the dvd for about <NUM> minutes and it made me sick thinking that i paid for this ? . i will not accept this if someone give it to me for free . if you 're serious in learning salsa , the new york salsa dvd series are very good . do n't waste your money on this one !
disappointing tome with numerous factual mistakes and a lack of understanding of those the author is interviewing . the book is far too dependent on paper sources and fairly clueless on the ground
the fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign . the big-concept selling point here is that on this album pwr was finally freed to be his highly original self , and played tunes by ornette coleman , coltrane , and monk ( along with his more standard fare ) . however , on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns , he does little more than state the themes as written , with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third . critics whom i trust praised this highly , and i bought it on their recommendation -- my mistake ; do n't make it
i have awaited the release of this particular art of noise lp onto cd for <NUM> years . this title was my all-time favorite art of noise record . upon opening up the cd & quickly jumping to track <NUM> - `` beat box '' only to find out it has been replaced by the version that appeared on `` who 's afraid of the art of noise '' . you can imagine my disappointment ! i thought for sure after <NUM> years i would finally have the original break dance classic of `` beat box '' in the digital format . anyway , being a true art of noise fan for many years , this was definately a let down
`` the denial of death '' is evasive and lacking in depth , not to mention excessively wordy . it could be seen , for instance , that death is a philosophical uncertainty . the denial of the absolute uncertainty of death ( and uncertainty in general ) could thus be a more profound form of denial . it could also be seen that a human being is as dead before his conception as after his death , and his prior state of death did not prevent him from emerging into life . death is then life-giving . further , a living being is made of 'dead ' matter - atoms as dead as those which make up rocks . where , then , does life begin and death end , and vice versa ? is there ultimately a difference between death and life ? in the end , this central notion lacks imagination ( at least you could credit freud with that ) , and has not been thoughtfully analysed , only assumed . by contrast , `` the human evasion '' is an unblinking analysis of the human condition and our psychological defenses against it .

unfortunately i have to express a degree of disappointment on this film released on dvd . whilest i enjoyed the acting & storyline , i was extremely annoyed on the number of scenes which had been deleted from the main film and shown as additional scenes within the main menu - for what purpose i do n't know - it just seemed to leave gaps in the film which certainly detracted from the enjoyment . i remember seeing this film many years ago and rated it one of rock hudson 's and julie andrew 's most cherished performances - however the deleted scenes really robbed it those memories
i was looking at the billboard hot <NUM> last year like i do every week , and at one point i noticed a song that was making moves was `` grind with me '' by pretty ricky . i had never heard of the song , and after i listened to it , i wished i still had n't heard of the song . i do n't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album , bluestars , but i did and , well , i could n't get the cd out of my stereo fast enough . i agree with reviewer hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group 's street team or something . pretty ricky consists of four people : three rappers ( spectacular , diamond `` baby blue '' , and slick -- and i use the term `` rapper '' loosely ) and one singer ( pleasure ) . the problem with this album is that these are the horniest and most talentless guys i have ever heard of , and that is a terrible combination . the lead single `` grind with me '' is really called `` grind on me '' , and it 's one of the nastiest things i have ever heard , but `` playhouse '' is n't far behind . and `` nothing but a number '' is very , very statutory . also annoying is their use of dated lyrics , like `` if lovin ' you is wrong , i do n't wan na be right '' on `` grind on me '' , or `` if i 'm lyin ' , i 'm flyin ' '' on `` grill ` em '' ( what does that even mean , anyway ? ) . the guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs , like `` from the back ! '' on `` get a little closer '' , and `` yes , sir ! '' on `` your body '' . also , while pleasure 's singing is n't horrible , it 's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping . actually , his chorus on `` shorty be mine '' is sure to cause you displeasure . speaking of that song , things are equally unimpressive when the guys do n't talk about sex , like on `` never let you go '' , `` ca n't live without you '' , and the obligatory bling-blingin ' songs `` chevy '' and `` grill ` em '' . but in the long run i guess all that does n't matter because nobody cares about pretty ricky any more and as my brother said , they 're probably now back to working at wendy 's . if i ever come across the bluestars cd again , in the words of `` your body '' , dammit , i 'll beat it up . anthony ruper
after hearing ice box i was very excited to hear the rest of the album . this album was supposed to be somewhat dark and haunting . exactly what ice box contains . a dark and haunting melody . the rest of the album is completely trash . so if you read this . you 're best buying the single for ice box
the worst christmas album i ever heard . i just bought it , played it once , and will never play it again
wan na torture me ? make me listen to one more cowboy shirted ex-punk rocker mangling their way through the hank williams or johnny cash songbook . get a buncha art institute of chicago students together , buy some cowboy shirts , overalls , etc . and call yourselves moonshine trailer or something , sing in a wide affected voice and flail on banjos , mandolins that you ca n't play and sing about whiskey stills , prison and stuff you do n't know nothing about . welcome to the world of bloodsh-t records . a buddy of mine said that ten years ago the owners of this label would spin records at a punk club and they had something like three country records : dwight yoakam , some gram parsons record and something else ... the title escapes me . bs records must die
eeyucch . sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background . oh look , is n't that wayne newton over there
the <NUM> 's was a really bad time for alice cooper . he had become a joke of his old self . he tried to do what aerosmith did with p vacation and comeback with a hair metal commerical album , but he flatout fails . the guitar playing is n't that bad at all , but the lyrics are cheesy making even the decent songs like teenage frankenstein , he 's back and crawlin pretty much guilty pleasures . the rest of the album is pure <NUM> 's mediocrity
this cd sucks so much . it 's the worst casualties cd ever . it has two good songs and the rest are completely horrible and they all sound the same . and i 'm not just saying that because they 're becoming more known/sell-out and stuff . this is seriously one of the worst cd 's i own and i bought it the day it came out because i am a big casualties fan and they were talking about this cd being one of their most hardcore and creative works . the only good things about this cd are that there are pretty okay lyrics , and finally we hear some backup vocals from the other members of the band , which was only heard in a couple songs in on the frontline . they need a new singer or something . and i agree with everyone who gives this cd a poor revie
never mind 's that it 's pretty stupid - `` john tucker must die , '' like a lot of movies about high-schoolers , actually hates high school and just about everybody in it , and by extension , american kids ; it 's the kind of movie that , if parents caught an hour of it , would make them think less of their children for watching it , and to a fearsome extent , pretending to live it out . early in the movie one character , a cheerleader , remarks about stealing her mother 's estrogen pills : `` well , guys use steroids to build their pecs . '' that estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader 's breasts is laughable , but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual , sickening line of the year . but it is what to expect from hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild , girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous `` laguna beach '' hacks who use insidious , and i mean insidious , editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched , again and again in the sloppiest manner , to the previous line of dialogue . `` jtmd '' asks us to believe that the title character ( jesse metcalf ) simultaneously dates three women ( ashanti , sophia bush , arielle kebbel ) without them knowing it , is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town , owns a great car , stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games , and my personal favorite , owns and drives a yacht . he and his brother have no parents to speak of . neither do the three girls , unless you count the cheerleader 's mom reference . one of them ( bush ) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen , however . and when they discover they 've all been dating the same guy in gym class , they get in a brawl and are not suspended , but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher . is this a satire , as `` jtmd '' bills itself ? an edgy comedy ? a smarter , cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline , in this post-columbine world , for looking at each other funny , and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news . a cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete , but , say head of the drama club . a cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase , ultra-hardened brat girls , but sweet , emotional , sunny girls . a cleverer film would know a dark comedy , if that 's what `` jtmd '' intends to be , ca n't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven . instead we have a fourth , `` smart '' girl ( brittany snow ) is introduced as the girls ' grand , `` taming of the shrew '' plan to woo john and eventually stomp his heart . this angel , of course , begins to fall for john , who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy , which are , if we follow our mtv , two of the trinity ( the last being sheer , drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have , preferably brown ) that makes up male desirability . director betty thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to . ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick , adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading , in an empowered , open society that has a foreign hindu woman as ceo of pepsi , represents the canopy of female of achievement . go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid ! we 've been pounding this earth for years now . why do teens and young women still trail along , lapping it up ? there is no real wit in the movie that you ca n't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a vh1 program , no style , no genuine attitude . it 's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty , young , rotten , unidealistic america most interested in getting tail , getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties . it is not immoral so much as it blank , a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic , most involving self-debasement of young bodies . what fools hollywood sees our children to be , wants them to be . what numb , donkey fools . if you need more proof , jenny mccarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she 's borderline believable . ya know , so much ugliness is spewed about `` islamofascists , '' these manaical , stoneaged fiends who apparently ca n't tell you the sky is blue , spending most of their time taping martyr videos , finding mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life . consider , though , that one of the more recognizable items in muslim countries is the satellite dish . a year from now , this thing 's on a movie channel , and well , whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the american decline into shame , they 've got it . not because it 's absent morals , but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be .
clive barker did a good job on the original candyman . it was truly a cut above most horror movies . the second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous . there is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable . donna d'errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks . lets hope this is the last sequel
deep lyrics man , i 'm getting a lot out of this ... but just wait for the next record when you 'll get & quot ; hold on loosely ! & quot
from what i can tell by the reviews on this page , all the proposals in this book are basically libertarian . it is thus highly misleading that the book calls itself centrist . the fact that only one person on this page has realized this , yet seems to think it 's a good thing , is also rather disturbing . the book seems like a thinly veiled attempt to move political dialogue rightward by making radical neoconservative proposals -- many of which the bush administration clearly supports -- seem moderate . let 's call a spade a spade
i 'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves . their first two albums really rocked the joint . but i 'm sorry to report that this album really does n't add up . it just does n't make much sense to me at all . there is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here ! instead they 've gone for a really lazy , laid back style which does n't hold yer interest . for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff , which sounds promising enough , but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and does n't re-appear at all . they then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends ! ! the whole album goes like that . songs barely get going and then promptly end . the second guitar play has disappeared to ! which means you do n't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( i reckon he was the talented one ) . they 've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who , i kid u not , puts samples of fireworks in one song ! ! ( i 've said enough ) c'mon people ! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls . i heard that andrea 's vocals are shot n ' the doc said she had to cool it down , so i can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something .. but they are heading in the direction of dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that . i 've listened to the album about <NUM> times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind .. what d'you guys think about it ? i hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop . it 's like henry rollins said `` if you aint gon na put <NUM> % in do n't even bother ''
basically i 'm a fan of b-movie fantasy films as well as a long time dnd player . i can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and i 'd easily say that its not the worst b-grade fantasy film ever made . however as a dnd movie it blows . i 'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject . i can fully understand the need to change some things . this is a movie and unlike some purists i understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different . however this film bore almost no resemblance to dnd . fortunately when the sequel ( wrath of the dragon god ) was made this was fixed . basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie . if you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok b fantasy movie that it is .
there 's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book . unfortunately , i think it 's better for your coffee table than your kitchen . while there are beautiful pictures ( lots of nigella ) and several great recipes , the book did n't seem very useful to me . i bought and loved `` how to be a domestic goddess '' , so , i got this book from the library to check it out , thinking it would be somewhat the same . i have to say i was dissapointed . i only found <NUM> usable recipes in the whole book . ( granted , i am not a gourmet chef by any means , but i do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a good cook . ) while there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a `` pretty to look at '' picture book than a hard core recipe resource .
beneath the remains , sepultura 's 3rd album from <NUM> this album , along with chaos a.d. and arise , is considered to be the embodiment of sepultura 's classic era , and many fans consider this to be one of the finest , if not the finest installment in the band 's catalog . with that said , this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else . there are a lot of great riffs , great solos , and a lot of time changes , which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans . be that as it may , though , you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record . it 's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality . an album like this really ca n't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre , such as metallica 's ... and justice for all , iron maiden 's powerslave , or megadeth 's rust in peace . i would give a track-by-track evaluation , but nothing really stands out here . i also have a gripe with max cavalera 's vocals . i was really not pleased with what i heard from him , as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career . andreas kisser and cavalera sound pretty good on guitar . the standout track would probably be `` slaves of pain . '' there 's a great little bit around the two minute mark where cavalera sings , `` open your eyes / do n't lose your steps / liberty is a dream / and it also is real , '' then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo . drummer igor cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance . this disc has something to offer , but what i 've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just ca n't get into no matter what you do . unfortunately , beneath the remains fell into the latter category for me .
this is truly one of the worst goth and related genre compilations i have ever heard . with the partial exception of disk # <NUM> , the songs chosen of even the best bands were among their worst or most mundane songs . it almost seems as if someone was given a list of bands and their songs and said 'pick songs to go on this album ' they put up a list of songs up on a board and picked them by randomly throwing darts at it . great bands on disk <NUM> , but again they picked some of the more mundane songs overall from bauhaus , legendary pink dots , die form , christian death ( disk <NUM> ) and some of the more classic favorites . again- on disk <NUM> which showed the most promise for other than the utterly mundane they had poor song choices- for example they chose 'drool ' for switchblade symphony ( which is a band i truly adore otherwise ) which is one of their least impressive and mundane songs . though they made it clear by the intro this was not just 'goth ' music , but supposed to encompass industrial and darkwave as well , i was stunned at how little gothic and darkwave music there really was- and was perplexed as to why they bothered putting metal-related bands on like two witches and several others on the compilation . a few good songs scattered on disk <NUM> and <NUM> , but why pay for <NUM> disks of music with some to a few good songs on each , when everything worth listening to could have just gone on <NUM> album ? hours of boredom listening for a few gems . for a good compilation i would recommend the goth box and the disease of lady madeline
this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project . there are no clif notes , spark notes , etc . for this book and there should be . do n't waste your time reading this book ! it has no twist , and i ca n't even imagine how there could be one , considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again . if you must read this book , i recommend some strong coffee and some valium
love michael buble , but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience . parts of michael 's head was cut off , and then ; sometimes , his whole head was cut off . most of the time , the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture . i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert . that this was just home made videos . this was definitely not worth $ <NUM> . if you want a professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act . caught in the act was worth the $ <NUM> bucks . you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements , and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd . also , the sound quality on caught in the act was way better . now , i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it . the dvd that i received was not enhanced . anyways , skip this one , and get `` caught in the act '' instead .
as usual , michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a <NUM> minute documentary should not run two hours . theres alot of great stuff here ( the interview w marilyn manson , the interview w trey parker , & c ) , but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling , no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston . i agree with many , nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution .
well , of course it is john lee hooker , but these slick , mushy recordings are very , very far from hooker 's gritty 40s , 50s and 60s waxings , and songs like the saccahrine , string-laden `` six-page letter '' are even wussier than the worst of his late 80s/early 90s guest star recordings . hooker obviously did n't have a chance to listen to the final mixes . whatever you do , make sure you listen to this album before buying it
i listened to this album and i actually felt cancer forming in my ear drums . nelly is wack as hell period . he is the modern day version of mc hammer . take a look at the music he is making now . this album is commercial as hell but when you slide down nelly 's resume it gets even more commercial . i mean how low can you go ? country grammar has some decent beats that get professionally wasted but the number one beat waster in the world . nelly is the worst rapper actor to ever walk this earth . what we need to do to people like this is to yank him off stage and tar and feather this klown . check out real hip hop like mos def and immortal technique
when i was <NUM> and first discovering guitar , i loved this album . listening to it now , it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.vai is technically very impressive , but the man ca n't write a decent song to save his life . vai 's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians , lay down a generic rhythm track , and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album . technique on your instrument is never a bad thing , however , technique should be just a means to an end , not the end itself . and that 's what no shred guitarist seems to understand . the fact that shred guitarists like vai are n't more popular is due to one thing : they 're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs . there 's a good reason why non-guitarists hate this stuff . basically , once you get past the `` gee , that 's neat '' factor , this album , and nearly all of vai 's music , feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.to be blunt , this is what john tesh or yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards . not only that , his guitar tone is absolutely awful . very thin , high pitched , and brittle sounding . the best thing on here is the blatant van halen rip-off `` the audience is listening '' : the rest is just masturbation . vai 's best work has always been as a sideman , especially the stuff he did with david lee roth , because then he 's forced to play actual songs , rather than <NUM> minute long , tedious guitar solos . on his own , he 's just unbearable . i considered giving this one star , but i gave it <NUM> stars due to the fact that vai can play , it 's just what he 's playing that 's the problem .
harold bloom , borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis , interprets the poet 's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic oedipal struggle , arguing that the ( `` belated '' ) poet 's literary productions result from a conflict with a `` strong '' father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the `` repression '' of his own poetic self and the strong misreading ( or `` misprision '' , as bloom calls it ) of the work of a predecessor . bloom 's conception of the `` canon '' is a hierarchical , continuous and genealogical model of direct succession , as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities , ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency , opening his text to the strong aura of the canon , and testing his productions against it . however , bloom 's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence , belatedness and originality , and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously . this admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial . another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of & quot ; influence & quot ; and & quot ; tradition & quot ; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness , for the poet can not be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching . bloom 's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents , and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works , reflects the postmodern & quot ; fin-de-millennium & quot ; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted , and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works , but merely repeat the past . not only are his conclusions totally untenable , but his whole treatise , on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents , fails to provide for a more dynamic , more forward-moving ( as opposed to reversing , revising and troping ) theory of poetry , a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully . it would be interesting to discover what bloom would make of henry adams 's remark : `` everything is respectable and nothing amusing . there are no outlaws .
being a big fan of grant 's unique guitar playing , i 've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music . as far as i know , this is the only book about him . the book does n't go into a great amount of detail . the discography and selected reviews are worth reading . i 'd say your best bet to understanding grant green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good cd of his- idle moments , green street , the complete quartets with sonny clark . then you can really get your money 's worth ..

the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched , it is actually completely false . the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered ( or is otherwise the victim ) , but what you did , in distinct criminal incidents . even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone , if you go back and murder them `` again '' then that is a new incident , and double jeopardy does not apply . in movies intended to be fantastic , diverging this much from reality might be ok . but this is a mainstream legal thriller . it 's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women do n't , for no apparent reason . but the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means , or they just ( accurately ) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is
this book is basically a compilation of different things , most of them pretty useless . in particular , all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory , totally obsolete . it seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a `` real '' sociology book
i love this band . they have an amazing amount of talent . however , this album has fallen short of their greatness . the first song is remenisent of `` the distance to here '' , but you 'll find out very quickly that this album lacks live 's creative song writing ability , and falls short of portraying their amazing talant . if you 're a hardcore fan , i would buy the album , but do n't expect greatness because it just is n't there
peter lorre 's , '' the black cat '' , is charmingly done.yet , the other two are stinkers.i 'm a corman fan , but this was boring and silly to watch.i think they had a good idea , bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.but , this version and interpretation of poe 's masterpieces did n't translate well at all.so , beware of the dog
so , the author does n't like walmart selling decent merchandise at decent prices ? i could tell that before i read this book . the <NUM> dollar price tag for a 160-page paperback book gave it away
i do n't know about this one .... maybe if it came with a book of corrections ! i do n't really recommend it , unless you enjoy reading books with a bunch of errors
poor sound quality , not professionally prepared . some bits and pieces of a sinatra live performance but hardly worth listening to unless you 're a die-hard fan that can not get enough of sinatra
this was just to much country for this parrothead . i liked one song , piece of work and that was about it
warning ! this video has no captioning . i 've rented it and it does not have captioning . it is useless to me and fellow deaf and hard of hearing folk
this book was n't that good .. in fact it is n't just good . the topic has been covered before and , to me , it was like i was reading those portions again only drawn out . there was nothing new to the story or even the way the author told it . i regret having bought the book and not sure i would recommend it even for someone to check out , free , at a library
i thought i was going to get a thriller when i first heard of this . instead i got a pseudo-sequel to cold mountain set in <NUM> texas , and i have rather low opinions of cold mountain . it was difficult to follow the story due to mccarthy 's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue ( a move i 've always considered to be a pretentious affectation ) , but also commas , apostrophes , and proper spelling , such as not capitalizing `` english '' or using `` livingroom '' instead of `` living room '' and `` mam '' instead of `` ma'am . '' i do n't know if this is something mccarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal , but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable . i also did n't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of sheriff bell at the beginning of each chapter/section , as he tended to ramble on about life after world war two and how it was n't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of delaware . hopefully its movie adaptation ( which i legitimately pity the coen brothers for having to wade through ) is more accessible
as a big feelies fan and a big galaxie <NUM> fan , luna would seem like the perfect band for me . and they were , for <NUM> releases anyway . this band has run out of things to say . dean wareham 's lyrics grow more inane with each release . ex-feelie stanley demeski is gone , replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer . buy lunapark or bewitched instead ... penthouse is okay , but the decline started there
'nightmare city ' aka 'city of the walking dead ' aka 'invasion of the atomic zombies ' ( by far the best title ) is pretty much the most reviled film of the european zombie cycle of the early <NUM> 's . i do n't think this is entirely fair . personally , i think this movie is better than mattei 's 'hell of the living dead ' . but , that ai n't much of a prize , and this film is pretty damn lousy . but , it 's still worth seeing if you 're a zombie fan . so , as i always say , if you 've even heard of this movie , you 'll probably think seeing it is worth your time . in some ways this film is slightly better than average . the scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent , perhaps slightly better than what you 'd usually get in this sorta film . none of the characters are remotely interesting , but the acting is not atrocious , if not good either , and the dialogue is rarely laughable . ( except for anna 's ridiculous , luddite social commentary . and that 's funny due to the content , rather than the delivery . ) the problem with this film is the zombies themselves . now , i 'm not a total zombie purist , but i ca n't call this a real zombie film . i do n't care that they run , and i do n't care that they are n't dead ( or maybe they are . i forget . do n't care either way . ) the problem is that they always use weapons and tools . now , it 's one thing to use these items sporadically , but they do it all the damn time . for the most part , these supposed zombies just run up and stab people . not very zombie like . furthermore , they just are n't animalistic enough . the fast zombies in '28 days later ' and the new 'dawn of the dead ' were at least wild and out of control . these ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads . what it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame . they look terrible , with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads , at best , or just some black goo . lame behavior and lame appearence= lame . i think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could 've been a middle of the road zombie pic , and if they had some decent gore . the gore in this is terrible , other than a few amusing exploding heads . it 's not especially gory for this sort of film either , though again , this is n't much of a loss considering the quality of it . there 's not too much else to say , it 's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up . reasonably amusing , but not much more than that . the only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation , and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks . that was pretty sweet . yeah , that 's it . amusing , but just barely . grade : d
when the man sings , he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone . the songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung , if you can call that singing at all
this movie takes the cool concepts of mimic , and then abuses , burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us . this movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer . if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy
just received the german <NUM> disc digipak . good news . played <NUM> mins of both - no problems . menus are all in english ( or german ) all the extra 's on the english r2 se 's are here except for the photo gallery . the sound is very good and the restored english mono is better than the mgm 5.1 also on here with the commentary and german mono . the 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation . picture . no problems i could see on my 6ft screen via infocus <NUM> projector from an arcam fmj-dv29 dvd player . player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything . only watched first 10mins of each but doing a-b comparisons with the english r2 mgm se 's the german ones are noticeably better , they look less washed out , contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on fistful , which is why i bought this set , but also on few dollars more as well . they are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly few dollars more is at last the full version , which no mgm dvd is worldwide .....
agree that it was beautifully filmed , but .... there must have been a great deal lost in the translation
i would give this book less than one star if that were possible . after reading the reviews , i eagerly ordered `` trust '' and anticipated reading it . well .... i read it and what a waste of time . stilted , unnatural dialogue and narration , a spoon-fed simplistic plot , robotic and one-dimensional characters , and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst i have read in many years . the sentences `` he stared into her eyes '' and `` he placed his hand on her shoulder '' appeared four times in the space of six pages ; then for good measure , the author throws them in several more times later in the book . there is no context given ; what do they imply -- a threat , a romantic interest ? the writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader could n't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next . in my case , perhaps that was true because the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting . i forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when i began . did the author self publish this book ? please , sir , go to writing school and get an editor
just like the ancient indian micmac burial ground there is no earthly , logical explanation as to why this movie exists . if you enjoyed the original or even the book then do yourself a favor and skip this facical , supposed 'sequel ' created merely to cash in on a name . m
this book is written assuming that you already know what went on , and fails to explain the details . i know that carlyle was trying to re-invent the way we write history , but the book is practically unreadible
i ordered this cd specifically for red , red wine and the whole song is n't even on there ! i was very disappointed . best song they ever recorded and i wasted my money trying to get it . do n't get this cd if you like that song
i must admit that virtually as soon as i bought this dvd ( out of curiousity because many other reviewers are in the & quot ; got ta see them live & quot ; camp ) i wondered if i 'd done the right thing ; when i played it i so much wanted to justify my purchase but alas can not ; there is energy , yes , but little variety - all musicians apart from dave s are subordinate & amp ; the performances , to me , are formulaic ; i almost cut it off after the first <NUM> tracks but skipped forward to & quot ; walking on broken glass & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; there must be an angel & quot ; & amp ; , thankfully found some comfort in the familiarity of these & amp ; the ( few ) songs which followed . bottom line : fine for true fans but not for the half-hearted
the a1a album includes `` god 's own drunk '' and this is not included on the cd with the same title . how did this happen ? we main purpose we purchased the cd for this song and it 's not here
our entire book club disliked this book . we had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters . howard , the largest presence in this story , feels like a blank at the core . upon putting this book down , his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me . characters such as jerome , victoria , and carl were intriguingly introduced , but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text . especially carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all . as am homage to howard 's end , some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me . for example , the heart-to-heart connection between kiki belsey and carlene kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between margaret schlegel and mrs. wilcox did . i thought zora was one of the most interesting characters , and i like how smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity . but smith makes her smug a bit too often , and so feeling a connection with zora is difficult as well - most of the time i just wanted to smack her . and i have to agree with the others that smith needs to brush up on her american characterizations . there was next to no authenticity in that regard . especially the southern dialogue - laughable ! it also feels like smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book ... i understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts ... but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling , unresolved , by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness . aaaargh ... must go and re-read howard 's end to dispell the queasy feeling left by on beauty
i thought it was boring.i didnt like the concept of it was too jewish . i didnt like they made jews too strict . i didnt like the way they made the customs . i didnt like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions . for example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath . i could understand it because i am an orthdox jew . because i have gone to yeshiva . most non jewish pepole cant understand the movie . as well as non orthdox jews.boaz yakin had no right makin the movie like this . he should make a sequel to learn from his mistakes to make it a public movie . i wish i were in show business to make the movie more normal
enough already of this street-hustler , drug scene `` coming of age '' wannabes . it has been done much better in `` johns '' and in showtime 's `` queer as folk . '' brendan fehr 's performance is an embarrassment . cookie , who sends her brother out to get some sex , is beyond belief . this movie has nothing to recommend it . no stars is my rating . but , thanks , amazon , for finding me a buyer of my dvd copy through my marketplace selling account
i have n't read mr. crawford/s book but i have read all <NUM> reviews . based on the reviews , not one soldier that served in iraq gave the book a positive review . that says those that know what serving in iraq is like find the author something of a fraud . it was pointed out that mr. crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the national guard is all about , including being recalled to active duty in a time of war . you can not over look this point . therefore , the rest of mr. crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier . drugs . you do n't do drugs in a combat zone . i served in vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well . i suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-iraq war bias .
not at all as interesting as i hoped it would be . the back roads of usa should be able to offer a much more colourful and interesting web than this
i liked the other eisenstein movies that i 've watched . alexander nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were american . battleship potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by hollywood . so i thought i would give this one a try . i really wanted to like this movie . it 's about the russian revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick . i could only get to about half way through the movie ( as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where i stop ) . excellent cinematography and music but i could n't watch more of it . way too thick for me
this is not the music from the movie . this purchase was a major dissapointment . you would do beter searching for the music credits for titles , then download the tracks form your music subscriber
this book is widely known as a classic , but the reader is left wondering `` why ? '' protagonist ( ca n't call him a hero ) of this novel is poor farmer ethan frome , who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife . he finds some `` excitement '' when mattie comes to visit , but again , the reader wonders why , because she 's vapid and uninteresting . to recap : we 're presented with characters that are n't the least bit likable to begin with , and turn pages eagerly waiting for the happy ending . instead , wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable . i feel like i wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book . why ? ? ?
poltegeist is the worst dvd set that i ever purchased . the plots are the most ridiculous and amateurish that i have ever encountered . characters have no clear delineation , they hover over any terrain that the writers hoist on them . contradictions and sheer lunacy are admitted into the script if the story demands it . characters who are sceptical one minute , suddenly swing wildly into occult belief full of knowledge of mystical arcana . the actors try to make this schmaltz work , however , at times their faces , confused at the blatant absurdity of the script , collapse into pseudo profound baffoonery . ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you can not even expel didainful laughter . this show is not even a `` turkey '' because the sheer stupidity of the script elicits revulsion of such a sharp quality that you can only dream of smashing the dvd 's with a hammer to eleviate the loathing that overwhelms your mind while wasting your life watching this dross . this show is so awful , i could n't give it away as a present for the justified fear that the recipient would promptly end our dear friendship due to the insult of unloading this manure to their dwelling . ugh ! avoid this show like the pox .
ruben did not do this song justice . if you are going to cover a song you better do a better job then the origal . if you what to hear flying without wings song like it should be check out westlife
this movie is stupid i should know i was one of the fools who brought this piece of trash do n't listen to the peaple that are saying this movie is great the movie is a home video thats all it is i suggest you read a reaview on a search ingin

i agree with one the comments posted below . the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him . over the course of the book he does n't change , he 's unsympathetic , and by the time we 've reached page <NUM> , we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page <NUM> . i found myself dying to get to the end of this book , just so i could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters . another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way . overall , i thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time
considering that it 's now been a year after the title date , and no comet has struck the earth , let alone greece ( during the olympics , yet ) , this book is a flop . put a prediction and date in your title , trot out nostradamus , and you may find that your audience expects results . to quote marvin the martian : `` where 's the kaboom ? there was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom ! '' . do n't worry , i 'm sure welch will write another book with amended predictions . it gets a whole star because it 's fun to check off the misses on major predictions as they pass
perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations , but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak , the singing is weak , and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music -- the songs are not all the same , but for some reason they all sound the same -- and embarrassingly , you can sing most of them after one listen , they are so simplistic and cliched
except for two cuties : william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard-on
american lives . hannity receives his talking points every day from the rnc , and then repeats them like the summoner from `` canterbury tales , '' repeating his two or three latin phrases . hannity 's phrases : - liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm 's way . - liberals do n't want to defend america and fought homeland security every step of the way ( when it was bush who fought it ) - howard dean hates republicans , he is unhinged , so is hillary , al gore , john kerry , and every republican except for ben nelson and joe lieberman . - osama bin laden was offered up to clinton on a silver platter . ( never happened ) so , as al franken says , hannity knows <NUM> facts , all of which are outright lies , or misrepresentations , so please do n't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the <NUM> facts he knows . do n't waste your money on this book - it , and he , are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other . he is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut , begotten on his listeners ' backs
can not remember a reading a worse book . boring , uninteresting story , repetitive dialogue . the only good think about it is that it is very short
punk , like all great rock music , was a rebellion , in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s . but somewhere along the way , it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against -- in the case of xtc , the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s . but these influences were far receeded on their debut album , `` white music '' is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is , more than anything else , an album of energy music . the net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band -- songwriters andy partridge and colin moulding would come later to excel at lush , detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks , textures and harmonies , but here , it 's all very stripped back , ska and punk influenced pop . moulding 's trademark slithering bass is n't quite in place yet , though he 's already starting to find holes to fit himself in , he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer terry chambers . partridge 's guitar , for his part , limits largely to angular punk and ska trends -- loud and aggressive , pushing the music along from the front , which leads barry andrews ' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band . but with all this , the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs -- partridge and moulding both use an unnatural , clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else , to the detrimant of the band 's sound . with all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album , it still manages to hit pretty frequently , helped no doubt by the fact that partridge 's songwriting was already top notch . standout `` statue of liberty '' best illustrates this -- hints of ska , gentle organ textures , and a funky bassline over which partridge 's clever story of unrequited love can be read out . nearly as notable are punky opener `` radios in motion '' ( full of crackling punk energy ) , the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single `` this is pop ? '' ( featuring the closest partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion , even if it is laden with great pop hooks ) , and new wave gem `` atom age '' , with just enough of a hint of brian wilson to pull it above the rest . on the other hand , there 's a lot of largely forgettable material -- moulding 's songwriting feels like it 's not quite ready ( `` set myself on fire '' ) and his vocal is even more painfully forced than partridge 's ( `` cross wires '' ) , and even partridge has a couple duds ( `` spinning top '' ) . add to this an ill-conceived ska take on `` all along the watchtower '' that makes partridge sound like a bad hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package . the reissue adds quite a bit to the original -- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there 's seven bonus tracks -- early singles and the `` 3d ep '' . most of this stuff is largely forgettable ( moulding 's `` heatwave '' , partridge 's `` dance band '' and `` traffic light rock '' ) , but early single `` science friction '' and its b-side `` she 's so square '' are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen . xtc would find enormous heights in the following decade , and i ca n't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they 'd eventually reach . i have a sneaking suspicion that had i not heard what they 'd be capable of in the future , i 'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating , but compared to their later work , `` white music '' sounds positively amateurish . it 's got its moments , but they 'd go on to do a lot better
this is not a `` typical '' fuller effort . he goes for the cinemascope view of post war japan , pictures of blossoms and mt fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer , robert stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along - and his full range of expressions from a to b . the drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as i imagined ms yamaguchi 's desire drooped at the thought of giving mr stack a massage . boy what a let down . mr ryan does his professional best but hey , he 's always a trooper worth watching . mr godard allegedly thought this was fuller 's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time . no no nannette ? no no noir
tho ' aerosmith 's first greatest hits package was n't perfect ( lacking train kept a rollin ' and featuring edited am single versions of a couple big hits ) , it still stands hair and shoulders above this `` second coming of aerosmith '' mix . where dream on was a definitive power ballad of its era , big ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies ( cryin ' , amazing , crazy ) that have become the bad boys ' schlock in trade . i reckon chart peak/career low i do n't wan na miss a thing will have to wait for hits <NUM> . even the so called rockers ( the dumb and dumber dude looks like a lady and love in an elevator ) ca n't hold a bic lighter to fine , funky seventies fare walk this way and same old song and dance , and i refuse to dignify anything from get a grip with an insult . it only gets worse , and sadder , after that album , folks . what 's the point of being the longest lived rock band after mick and keith if you 're not even gon na rock anymore ? ? ? ( sigh ) ... call me `` jaded '' . rating : two lips
the movie `` extreme ops '' which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it . it is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment . let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips . this movie has no plot and no characterization . the point appears to be to display some `` amazing '' stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station . the plot , and i use the term loosely , concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film . they have been hired by a japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche ( the reason why is never really given ) so this ragtag group heads for austria . why they made the decision to film the shot in the alps instead of the perfectly good rocky mountains is similarly never explained , except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death . understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers . he , like the theater audience , seems to find them just as annoying as we do , but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or , even more sensibly , walking out in the middle of the movie , he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them . i usually try to find some good points in a movie i review so it is somewhat balanced , however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say , i guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count ? do yourself a favor and give this a miss . i would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on dvd shelves . there is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull , dumb movie
item never received . impossible to contact by email the customer service . my last purchase on amazon
i was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my dvd player and sat down to watch . it did n't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film . the story was interesting and had it been done in a better way , the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as trick and latter days where the acting and production quality were very good , i found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments . it is not a movie i would readily recommend
this is j.a . jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help
i do n't see the comparison to jeff buckley at all ! that was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album . all the songs are much too similar , the guy 's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and , if you remember london suede , has a very similar sound to them ( though i will say that london suede was much better ) . no one has come close to the pipes of j. buckley ( or even tim b. , for that matter ) in years and this does n't count any where near that , either
by `` it '' i mean the evil monster called `` repetition '' . it may sound like a strange thing to say , but if you already own doyle 's `` harry potter and the goblet of fire '' , there 's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack . the film feels like you 've seen it a thousand times already , and so does the score . i ca n't stress enough how much i dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs , and ride them out until the end of days . that being said , it 's not a big reach saying that goblet of fire and eragon sound exactly the same . and they do . the orchestrations could n't be more identical , and the theme is the same , even if doyle adds a few flourishes . it may fit the film somehow , but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music , or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years , or worse , as a standalone piece , it 's just a horrible product , it 's patrick doyle on autopilot . and even if it does fit the film , there 's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well . a great film score gives the film a unique feeling , and eragon does n't do that . instead of writing an `` eragon '' score , doyle churned out a patrick doyle score . sound crazy , but that 's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers . and contrary to the opinion of many , doyle is merely a good composer , and so we get a doyle score with eragon fingerprints instead of eragon music with patrick doyle fingerprints .
what was the point of this film ? there is no lesson learned , no story to tell , no entertainment factor even associated with it . i guess it was an excuse for jennifer jason leigh and alan cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their hollywood buddies together for <NUM> hours of nonsense .
gould 's '55 recording of the goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man . perhaps it needed to be played this way , at least once , or perhaps gould needed to play it this way at that time . he thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time . it is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound , but how beautiful it is ! bach does n't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did gould . you can still hear his vocalise ( love it or loathe it - i love it ) , but the passion , depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else 's efforts too . hear them both and then decide for yourself richard maycoc
i get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about . hate to break it to you kids , but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s . it was called neutral milk hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the decemberists . before you disagree with me , go pick up neutral milk hotel 's in the aeroplane over the sea ( <NUM> ) , and then try to disagree
nothing new for me . but will have been very valuable when i started on the internet
starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias , the problem with this film is the same bias
i bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun , easy recipes for wraps that i could toss together with stuff i had around the kitchen . although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious , fun and easy they 're not . it 's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen ingredients . when i want to toss together a little lunch , i do n't have time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or <NUM> cups cooked jasmine rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil . i have yet to make a single recipe from this book , despite having owned it for over nine months
volcano is an absurd r list movie story that somehow got an a list budget and a list cast to star in it . the pitiful attempt to make a disaster movie is just a horrifying waste of talent and money . i wish this were a comedy instead of a serious movie ; it 's one of the funniest things i 've seen all year . where are mike , crow and tom servo when you need them ? this is an mst3k movie if there ever was one . to make volcano 's boring predictable story a chimpanzee probably took the copies of screenplays of other bad disaster movies , cut out the worst scenes and then pasted them together to make the script for this movie . if there are people stupid enough to write this stuff up for real ; i do n't want to know about them . you must only need a room temperature iq to be a screenwriter and make the big bucks . schoolteachers who put in 12-15 hour days struggle to make a living and the writer of this screenplay drives a bentley . shows you how fair life is . according to this movie , there 's a live volcano in the middle of los angeles . fault lines the seismologists know about , but somehow they miss a volcano in the middle of an entire city . holding this wafer thin plot together are the cardstock disaster movie clichÈ characters who spout clichÈ lines . tommy lee jones ( fresh off his oscar win , shows you how many good roles those worthless gold statues get you . ) is an overworked los angeles fireman who wants to just go on vacation when the catastrophe starts . yeah , there is one of these guys in every one of these disaster movies . the dialogue spouted in this movie will have you in stitches . every line is a ridiculous clichÈ and sounds extremely ridiculous . oh yeah anne hecht is the blonde pretty geologist who knows all about volcanoes and schools the audience . she also has an interest in tommy lee . don cheadle is the guy who sits in an office and banters with jones over the radio . there 's the teenage daughter who constantly is getting herself in the path of danger . keith david is the cop who does get to go outside and bark orders . this film is a laugh riot . badly computer generated lava threatens to destroy all those beautiful california landmarks . in one scene a guy is walking down a hot tunnel and his nikes are melting ; the poor guy gets engulfed in hundred thousand-degree lava and does n't scream in agonizing pain . he 's making a noble sacrifice saving lives . everything leads up to the demolition of a brand-new office tower to cap the flow of the volcano . tommy lee jones goes to save the teenage girl from a collapsing building , that 's underneath the lava and comes out alive . at the end of the movie enjoy the `` volcanic ash '' that snows down in sunny california makes everyone look the same . bleech . i read somewhere the studio spent $ <NUM> million on to make this dreck . instead of spending all that money to make this movie , they should have paid the screenwriter twice that much to disappear and buried this screenplay deep under the la brea tar pits so it could never be made into a movie . but hiding this vile story there would probably lead to the tar pits vomiting up lava in the middle of la . just like the movie . i 've seen my share of bad movies and over the past ten years hollywood somehow continues to make films worse than edward d. wood jr could ever think of putting on celluloid in his lifetime . plan <NUM> from outer space and glen or glenda had a more cohesive plot and better acting than volcano . unless you 're looking for a movie to roast at your mst3k party at your house avoid this on-screen disaster .
originally placed the order for the non-thinpak release as amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the `` new '' slimline thinpak . seems mgm decided not to release this box set in the original style ; annoying to say the least . they 've previously released seasons <NUM> through <NUM> in the old-style . sg-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what 's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases ( season <NUM> & <NUM> ) ? ? this is not unlike the simpson 's box sets which were changed in season <NUM> to `` head shots '' of simpsons characters . after much protest , their distributor came out with original box set-style releases . smaller package ... less inserts ... looks puny on the dvd rack next to the other eight seasons ... same price . got ta love that marketing plan ! i 'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes mgm will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school
that 's basically my two cents . shallow characters , bizarre story . i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films , but i do like a good story and heard this was one . it was not . all of the characters were inverted - ada and her daughter were utterly irritating , george was disgusting from start to finish , and sam neill 's character ( supposedly the heartless jerk ) was actually the easiest to sympathize with . how frustrating ! on a positive note , michael nyman 's score is unbelievable . i love it
having really enjoyed 'you 've come a long way baby ' - one of my favorite albums - i had high hopes for this work , after all , they are just a year or two apart . oh , was i disappointed . perhaps if one were thrashing around at a rave party while out of their gourd on x , then this album would sound a little better , but stone cold sober i really had a hard time with this ensemble . the constant looped samples just repeat and repeat seemingly , in some instances , for ever . i see this album almost as a test case for cook 's later - and musically far better - work . one can really see the roots here of how this style and sound was massaged and refined into something much more musically coherent with 'you 've come a long way baby ' . song for lindy stands out as one of the more tolerable tracks along with going out of my head , everybody needs a <NUM> and michael jackson . the guitar riff in santa cruz never seems to stop and gives me a headache while the lyrics in give a po ' man a break could do exactly that . the rest of the tracks are evidently an exercise in how to use a sequencer and are apparently written to cram as many repeated samples into each song as possible . i really wanted to like this album , but it offers little of redeeming quality ; quite simply it 's dull . ultimately , there is just not enough here to warrant its purchase
purple city 's debut release is `` the purple album '' ( <NUM> ) . having made their mark on the mixtape scene the dipset affiliate trio of emperor shiest bub , un kasa & don bishop agallah provide this release . the harlem trio start off the album with `` live your life '' repping their group and thanking the diplomats for paving the way , the best part of this track for me is the chorus . the typical `` gangsta '' has shiest bub collaborating with jim jones and max b backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep , the verses are equally boring . laidback `` fly high '' follows , backed by some mellow production purple city pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut . i do n't know if purple city is paying tribute to the south movement , or trying to capitalize on it with `` trap n * * * * '' either way it 's a weak attempt to sound like young jeezy , its actually disturbing . `` go head '' follows purple city proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut . `` nick nack '' is a lame attempt at a club track , horrible chorus . tec , steele and buckshot drop in for the grimy `` hustlers '' . agallah , un kasa and affiliate ike eyes team up for another bland cut with `` picture me rollin '' . shiest bub collabs with a-mafia on `` head bust open '' rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with purple city . purple city 's decides to spell things out again on `` p.a.y.d.a.y. '' . while `` grind slow '' feat . buddy klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies . shiest bub closes the album off with `` catch him '' repping himself . lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them i feel like i have heard it all somewhere else before . none of them have distinct flows and production is average . if you love dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this . this may sound brutal but listening to the `` the purple album '' to me is like watching a bad b movie , not worth my time .
why do you all still support this clown ? ja rule has n't been hot since his first album . then he let a clown just as wack as him crush his career . ja rule is as commercial as they come and his lyrics display that . he is all about the money and not about making good music . this is a very poor release . it is just as wack as dem franchise boys and d4l . jefferey needs to stop rapping and go rob a bank like steady b
here it is , rick warren 's latest purpose-drivel ¬Æ corporation 's latest marketing ploy . the insistent promotion of the purpose-drivel ¬Æ life is nothing but an affront to christian decency and blasphemous attack on jesus . so far , the purpose-drivel ¬Æ corporation 's resin cross , also created to pad warren 's disney-esque church has n't shown up on amazon but it is available for viewing on his publisher 's site . this latest book makes a mockery of christianity and should not be considered by anyone who is truly intent on seeking god 's grace . remember , rick , `` the meek shall inherit the earth !
remember the days when we were punks and we 'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders ? they held up to <NUM> minutes of music ! count 'em , <NUM> minutes ! then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him , including myself . he was quite the singer . when i was a young kid though , the only form of music we had were the concerts . i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert , quite an amazing virtuoso , and johann strauss jr. conducting his orchestra , those were the days . then they came out with those things called grammophones , which were even more modern , if it was even possible . but it was , because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to , lazy kids . i mean , you did n't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones . and what 's this , <NUM> hour , a full <NUM> minutes of music , on <NUM> record ? pshaw ! <NUM> minutes of music was all i needed , and i was still pooped out even after that . in my day , it was bed at <NUM> p.m. , breakfast at <NUM> a.m. , then off to the mines . we did n't have <NUM> minutes of free time . i have no idea what form of music they have now . appearently , they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph . now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods ( ? ) and mp3 , mp4 players , whatever they 're called , listening to that `` hip-hop '' tomfoolery of theirs . you ca n't even call it music , it 's just noise . well , got ta get ready for bed now , it 's almost 3:45
although the poems are beautiful ... and i certainly do n't mean to bash whitman with this 2-star rating ... it 's the wrong book . not as advertised . this was supposed to be the original <NUM> edition . that 's what i expected , and therefore ( in my mind ) what i was paying for . the original <NUM> edition , according to modern literary analysis , was the `` strongest/purest '' version . it was the true starting point of whitman 's own ( and consequently america 's ) poetic awakening . consisting of just <NUM> `` perfect '' poems , it was that edition which emerson praised so highly . whitman never put out another book ... just revision after revision , addition after addition , and edition after edition of leaves of grass ... until you wind up with `` the deathbed edition '' which is a severely bloated and different work from the original . i was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition . which is what the item description says this is . it 's not . be forewarned ... it 's the deathbed edition of <NUM> ... nearly <NUM> pages . and frankly , there are much better versions of the deathbed edition . sturdier versions with nicer pages exist ( this is a pretty weak paperback , printed on pulp pages ) , with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions . shop around . to sum up ... the <NUM> star rating is because lying about which edition this is , is a terrible way to sell the book . whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate . it just would have been nice to get what i paid for . the `` true '' editon , written by a young whitman at the height of his powers ..
the only reason i finished `` the transit of venus '' was the hope of any improvement . this book took away two hours of my life-two hours that i can never earn back by reading true literature . the story ( is there a story ? ) is dreadful . the sentence structures , the paragraph performances , the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if ms. hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights . i will never recommend this book to any audience . ms. hazzard and her publisher should refund my money
also known as trinity rides again/ la collina degli stivali . the print of this <NUM> italian western film is very poor . grainy and greenish sometimes . right away you will notice that terence hill and lionel stander ( a star is born [ <NUM> ] , hart to hart tv series [ 1979-84 ] , hart to hart tv-movies [ 1993-96 ] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else . sometimes you hear stander 's real voice . stander plays a circus ringmaster . with his assistance he will help terence and bud spencer take down the bad guys in the west . difficult film to enjoy without terence hill 's real voice . victor buono also in the film
it would be nice , as a couple of other reviewers stated , to have included some of the `` score '' as well as the songs and arrangements already present . i was hoping their would be a bit of that when i ordered it . the songs are good but did n't warrant listening to the cd more than a couple of times
this movie is one of cinema history 's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success . `` saturday night fever '' from a few years before is another example , but that movie could actually stand on its own . jennifer beales ' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside , i do n't think this one could . i understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of <NUM> 's children , and i will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema . the problem is , the movie 's plot is a slow-moving , wasted opportunity . physically , beales is sexy enough to keep your attention , and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man 's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made . but her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character . come to think of it , the acting all around is a bit weak . but that 's not the problem . the movie suffers from two fatal let-downs . the first is the plot itself . feminism-affirming depictions aside , it 's pretty simplistic , unimaginative stuff , even for a dance movie . what 's worse is how slow it all moves . the drama sequences in-between dances drag on , straining your patience and sympathy for the character 's plights . the other more tragic flaw , since it is a movie about dance , is the cinematography . while it 's certainly not the worst cinematography ever , ( check out `` the limey '' next time you want a headache . ) the dance sequences look like they 've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor . we 're supposed to be moved by beales ' character 's natural talent , but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits . by the time the final dance scene finally comes along , the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out , bad editing . it almost seems the judges let her into juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute . perhaps i 'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing . but if it 's a movie about dancing , one would think the least they could do is show dancing . many movies before and after flashdance managed to get this right ( `` saturday night fever '' certainly did , to its great success ) , but maybe nobody told this movie 's director . it 's a shame
some folks need only a paper-thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences , without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way . if that 's you , this may be your movie . xtreme sports , xtreme ops . get it ? if that does n't strike you as xtremely clever , you may find this movie painful to watch . i 'm thinking of telling the agony booth about it . the humor does n't work , to the extent that i think i want a laugh track after all . or a drummer doing rim shots . ba-dum-bum ! characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms , hair style and/or color , or shouting all his dialogue . i did n't watch it all . i did n't even watch enough to tell you what it 's about . amazon or imdb can tell you what it 's about . just something else we found in the flat . someone 's losing credibility as a selector of dvds .
set against the backdrop of the spanish civil war , & quot ; talk of angels & quot ; could have been provocative and sweeping , but it settles for little more than standard-issue governess falls for the rich guy romance . vincent perez has a smoldering presence , but the beautiful polly walker is as flat on screen as a fascist protest poster . the two have little chemistry . the result : a stilted and perfunctory outing . the only saving grace is the always wonderful frances mcdormand , whose hard-bitten , love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest
tangled ( jay lowi , <NUM> ) shawn hatosy has been doing the character-actor thing in hollywood for a long time . lowi , in his first feature film , gives hatosy a starring role , and pairs him opposite established stars rachael leigh cook ( antitrust ) and jonathan rhys meyers ( titus ) , as well as throwing lorraine bracco ( the sopranos ) into the mix -- and he still ca n't come up with a good movie . now , i 'll watch jonathan rhys meyers in anything , and i have , and i still had trouble with this mess . the basic idea : david klein ( hatosy ) wakes up in a hospital with a police detective ( bracco ) at his side . it seems kelin 's girlfriend jenny ( cook ) and his best friend alan hammond ( meyers ) are both missing from the wreckage of hammond 's car , where klein was found . klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective , piecemeal , with scenes from the present intercut . predictable , boring , cliched , two-dimensional , need i go on ? if the ending of jodi picoult novels comes as a shock to you , you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise . no one else will . *
ok . i just got this cd today , and now i 'm happy . was late , but only got this album for `` good morning beautiful ''
this is the third installment in the mitch rapp series and the author 's fourth book overall . ( i 'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they 're better reads . ) mitch is america 's # <NUM> `` go to '' guy when it comes to fighting terrorism . in `` separation of power '' he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission ( someone tried to kill him ) , the political `` in-fighting '' surrounding the naming of a new cia chief , rogue mossad agents , iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love . one could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents ww iii . not so . mitch 's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic . the `` action '' threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first <NUM> pages , does n't really begin until after <NUM> pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts . there is an inordinate amount of `` character development '' - self-serving , amoral , scheming politicans & our world weary , battle scarred reluctant hero mitch , who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the `` romance '' impedes the plot . the book hastily concludes , ( 20+ pages ) , in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale . hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author 's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports . unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and mitch 's `` new '' situation does n't guarantee that .
bebe and cece demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of & quot ; gospel & quot ; songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song . unlike a true gospel artist like vickie winans , who has the ability to evangalize through her music , these performers seem to be embarrassed about being inspirational . this disc is for the bubble gum christian , not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously
i got into afi with the release of art of drowning , which is a fantastic album . my girlfriend at the time had black sails in the sunset and even though i did n't really get into it then , i now think it rivals aod . afi has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress ( this is highly commendable ) . these two albums , which formed my introduction to afi , now stand as the mid-part of their career . the band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what 's cool . they 've always been unique . their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's hardcore punk scene . davey havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says , `` ever since i can remember i wanted to be in a hardcore band , '' at the beginning of the `` he who laughs last '' video . these albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene . when the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark ( it was there in the early days , though , in songs like brownie bottom sundae ) . these middle albums ( haloween ep and self-titled included ) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound . moreover , i 've yet to hear a band in the world of punk ( past and present ) who 's music rivals this intensity . i appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level ; they continue to break the mold ( the goth glam influence is pretty cool ) . besides , who can say they did n't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on black sails and aod . but , personally , it 's pretty difficult to listen to decemberunderground . afi deserves all the respect in the world but i do n't feel much of the fire of the old days .
i received my first edition ordering your private world ( opw ) in <NUM> , as an undergraduate . i did n't really like the touchy-feely style of presentation , without any corroborrating references , for example , to the author 's science of sleep minimization nor a biblically developed case for journaling . i remain puzzled on many points in the book . contrary to the author 's position , the psalmist tells us that & quot ; god grants sleep to those he loves & quot ; . while journaling can be a productive discipline , could it also lead to indulgent self-absorption ? and if the journal is a private work , why would it be a treasure to posterity ? as i realize that the author 's life could be construed as fairly disordered , at least from several direct observations i 've had of him failing to keep his commitments ( from the time of his original opw to the time of this new edition ) , i feel less discomfort in providing a less than enthusiastic review . during my recent move to a new home , i decided to discard a box of & quot ; low-utility & quot ; books . without reticence , i included my old copy of opw in the junk box . how ironic , perhaps even spirit guided , my consternation when the current opw was required reading for an upcoming leadership course , and i had to further donate to the author 's estate given how i remembered the first edition . perhaps that cost could be redeemed by this feedback . a basic issue for many christians is living the & quot ; driven vs. called & quot ; life . i believe that the book will be more convicting to those who are driven , because they may experience some empathy with and conviction from the author , who himself is an admitted driven personality . for such a reader , i can only conclude that replacing the drivenness to succeed with a pursuit of god 's calling can only expand his creative purpose and kingdom . i believe that the author is a fellow believer of jesus christ , and has been redeemed by god for his purpose . i suspect that i am as much as a sinner as he is , but i 'm not the one peddling orderly life advice . now that i have now read the latest edition , i am still recommending that this probably is not worth your time or money
unlike so many tutorial or reference books on the subject of illustrator , this book only skims the surface of the key functions of illustrator . things to be aware of : there are no companion cd tutorials - you 're on your own . this book does not give you detailed information on how to do anything . a few step-by-step examples are given on some certain methods , but mostly not . the few examples of `` how to '' are very high level and do not go into any detail . this book will not serve as a good reference book - information is to high level and does not include details . you will have to create your own graphics just to follow along the lessons so you can understand the concept . on the plus side : the book now has color illustrations . the tips on the bottom of each `` how to '' lesson are very useful . if you have a general knowledge of illustrator , this book can be used without the software or a pc as casual reading . the book is broken down in seven parts : part <NUM> - prepare your illustrator project part <NUM> - draw objects part <NUM> - add type part <NUM> - work with drawings part <NUM> - manage fills part <NUM> - use layers and styles part <NUM> - from illustrator to print and web this book borders on being useless for people who are seriious about learning illustrator . better books that will help the novice illustrator : illustrator cs hands-on training by [ ... ] books the adobe illustrator manual/book that comes with the software
not a lot else to be honest . so many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at , but to be honest is speed really everything ? all the songs on the cd lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song . every fu * * ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats , some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you 've heard one but by the end of the cd its a drag . do n't get me wrong , to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability , but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive
i did n't care for the sountrack nearly as much as i thought i would . it lacked the excitement of the movie
i 'm going to be straight up , the title says it all . thrice was a great band , illusion of safety is one of the most incredable albums ever . now they sound like every other band out there today . personally i hate emo , i grew out of that crap along time ago . i 'm sorry if i offend people in saying that . i just dont see any talent in it . thrice used to be my favorite band . being a guitarist myself , i enjoyed identity crisis ' true hardcore sound , and illusion of safety 's amazing creativity , but the artist in the ambulance and this new cd are crap . if your emo , then give it a shot , but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you ca n't avoid every time you turn on the radio , put this album back . it 's time to move on thrice fans . they came .. they rocked .. there done
god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic . and yes , maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book 's great reputation , i entered it with high expectations . - which the book however did not satisfy . yes , it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time , a lampoon of the courtship ritual , and of course oh so witty , blah blah blah , but it just was n't my cup of tea . the main character was likeable , but that aside , i found it completely insufferable to read through , and absolutely painfully boring . every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted , let alone the ending . not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with , `` then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea , walked and talked and had more tea , then got married and lived happily ever after . '' the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama . it would save more time just to watch a chick flick . so if you 're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters , witnessing the agony over who 's going to marry who ( even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance ) , then this is the book for you ! ! if not , then i suggest picking up some dan brown .
i love jackie chan and all of his movies , buy i will admit this is not one of his best . it 's quite bad actually , i bought it cos it was cheap and i like to own all of jackie 's movies in my collection . not even claire forlani could really save this one , she looks totally out of place in this movie . i only recommend it to serious jackie fans , i could n't imagine anyone else getting through the whole <NUM> minutes
ya this cd is okay . its just really generic nu-metal . i like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is linken park . i do n't hate this , i just think it is kind of boring and not that cool . partially why this does not get <NUM> stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal , but its just plain . not great , not terrible
after using dr.dyer 's aaah meditation cd for a month , i decided that i wanted to learn more this meditation . therefore , i bought the book manifest your destiny . the book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism . there are many things that disturb me about this book . dr. dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book , chapter , or verse . one of the bible quotes he uses is `` is it not written in your law ` i have said , you are gods ? ' '' ( john 10:34 ) this is the passage to which jesus referred when he said this to the pharisees who were attempting to charge him with blasphemy : `` god standeth in the congregation of god ; he judgeth among the gods . how long will ye judge unjustly , and respect the persons of the wicked ? ... i said , ye are gods , and all of you sons of the most high . '' ( psalms 82:1,2,6 ) . the unjust judges of israel ( i.e. , the pharisees ) were the subject of these verses . they were civil magistrates because of their authority and power ; and , they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of israel . dr. dyer uses this verse completely out of context . scripture can not be broken . jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are god 's other laws . a true seeker of spiritualism can not reconfigure god 's word for his own purpose . neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about god 's word and actually expect to know god 's and come into a relationship with him . dr. dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism . the fact of the matter is that according to jesus the door to god 's kingdom is narrow ( luke 13:24 ) . there are no shortcuts . lastly , a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions . this appears to be a main theme of dr. dyer 's book . those who seek god first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a `` gift '' from him . we do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust god and put him first in our lives . dr. dyer seems to miss the point .
i can happily say i did n't waste my money on this book , i read a friend 's copy . he has since relinquished this boko to its deserving place , file <NUM> . it contains nothing new . nothing relevatory . it does contain the author 's assertions devoid of facts . the author 's opinions disregarding such niceties as what the law says and the historical evidence . it reads as just another standard regurgitation of the anti-israel propaganda that has become so popular . do yourself a favour and spend your money on something else
kasey 's foray into the pop genre does n't really bother me , and she certainly is n't selling-out either.this release however just does n't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had . not much more to say exept that this , along with allison moorer , & randy rogers band are my <NUM> biggest let-downs of this year
i love jeff goldblum , but he did n't carry this film . the film was ruined for me the second julane moore ( yuck ! ) and the ridiculous , lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film . it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter . what a concept . it just added to the disbelief of the characters ( stay goldblum ) , the storyline , and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel . jurassic park iii was n't much better
.. these <NUM> have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so i ca n't understand why they put this out . the album lacks quality , imagination , energy , and inspiration . there is n't one g funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff . i 've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole cd in a short space of time . to you gangsta listeners out there , do n't waste your money .... i ai n't gon na go on any more about this album so if you do n't believe me .. buy it
let me first say this , roots is basically paul simon 's graceland , except nu-metalized . these guys went to south america , cut a couple of terrible tracks with `` natives '' ? , then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure . this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics , excessive `` guesting '' of other crappy artist , bad guitar , bad sitar ( ! ) , and the inclusion of anything to do with korn , all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and rambo style striped face paint . the biggest waste of time , money , and matter . its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using . a real bummer .
this is an awful attempt at nothing but to try and squeeze more money from fans who just flock to the words `` limited edition '' . save your money . there is no reason to buy these . at all . no dts , no commentaries . capitalism at it finest
i liked his other housing boom book much better . this one is not as good and too opinionated . what a shame ..
do n't recognize the names of any of these dj 's ? for good reason ; their talent is non-existant
i have read and enjoyed james patterson in the past , but can honestly say that this will be the last patterson book i will read . i was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability . the book had no depth , and the story suffered for it . as i read the book i got the impression that mr. patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible , and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting . i did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable .
because i like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot , i only liked the cut `` lucky to know you . '' `` seeing through you '' is all right , too . perhaps reynolds will independently release a cd of his own with more songs like `` lucky to know you . ''
i like the song of salif that why i look for one of his like les ambassadeurs international with salif keit
i 've read a lot of stephen king 's work , and loved most of it , but 'firestarter ' was a big letdown ! it 's not quite in the 'abomination ' category of 'from a buick <NUM> ' , but at least king could blame that one on his car accident . this one is probably only about as good as 'the tommyknockers . ' the premise is great , but once it gets away from 'andy and charlie on the run ' , and becomes 'the life story of tom rainbird ' , it goes downhill very quickly ! not to knock king too much , but as this books goes along , it seems obvious that sk was losing interest , either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason , and wanted to 'explore ' the supporting characters more ; or simply because this book came out fairly early in king 's career , when he was known to partake of certain 'substances ' which he later swore off ! worth reading only if you really want to read every sk novel . otherwise , just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one ( with the exception of the two mentioned above ) surpasses 'firestarter '
we do not think this video is worth purchasing . after receiving it and viewing it we were disappointed in its storyline and also the quality of the tape itself . i did n't think i would find a tom selleck movie i would n't want to watch but this is the one
yikes .. saw this on tv a while back and there was no cussing . bought the dvd and wow , it was filled with it .... way too much . but the story was very creative and would be a great family film if the language was cleaner . clean language would 've earned a <NUM> star rating .
ron clark is another award-winning teacher who apparently does n't have a life away from his students . his <NUM> rules sometimes cross the line into `` parent '' territory , as when he teaches his children how they should answer the phone at home , and his `` abc 's of etiquette '' is subdivided into <NUM> rules about table-mannners . he also apparently takes students on field trips that he sometimes pays for out of his own pocket , a questionable practice in most districts . some of his suggestions , like assigning extra work as a punishment , are just wrong . new teachers will perhaps be inspired by this book , but there is nothing here that any veteran teacher could n't tell you . save your money
the newer editions of the delorme atlases are much inferior to , and skimpier on data , than their older editions . i assume they did this to save on printing costs . the maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had . for example , in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks , few of which are even named , and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included . other than the newly added gps coordiante data , they are just glorified road maps , which you can get at the gas station . i own several of these from many years back , but am very disappointed in the new editions
i expected this book to be fun take on the hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the `` other side '' and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms . nope . susanne hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers ( and her nanny friends ' employers ) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule . it would have been much , much better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements . in every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires . she seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set . there was no joy in reading this book once i realized that while she may have changed the children 's names , the names of the parents were quite real . it puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar
this book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class . in my opinion , the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together . totally different writing style as you go throught the book . in addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw . n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent . our professor ended up hating the book himself . a good reference maybe but not for the beginner
you 'd better hope you 've got a good professor for dynamics , because this book is absolutely no help . it gives proofs for most equations , but does n't seem to think any amount of example problems are necessary . i have the bootleg copy of the solutions manual for this book and the author solves most of the problems with bizarre calculus that is n't discussed in the chapter at all . to top it off , the set ( statics and dynamics ) was $ <NUM> at my college bookstore . pool your money with your classmates , buy one copy of each , and xerox the problems . you will not miss anything
no doubt , these lyrics and music are superb ; after all , this is why i purchased this cd . what wonderful memories ! but , this particular cd 's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless . i did n't intend for this cd to be simply background music , as i like to become `` drawn into '' the recording , but that 's all i can do . what a disappointment ! i have ordered many wonderful cd 's from amazon that sound great , but felt compelled to write and warn others . i give this cd at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music , but only a 1-star for it 's sound quality . with engineering like this , its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the internet rather than make a purchase
vp1 was an astonishingly good representation of the impact of the <NUM> 's on the next decade ... it had a great car and a good cast ; great soundtrack and good scenery as well as a `` feel '' for what a lot of the usa and its inhabitants were like ( low budget so it used a lot of real people and locales ) . kowalski had tried the straight and narrow and then the crooked and lowdown . he had failed ( not always his fault and did have some successes ... medal of honor , e.g . ) at each ... had suffered the loss of his love , so , all that was left was death . vp2 has the dodge challenger r/t and a vapid , inane plot . what a waste of a great repro/rebuilt classic muscle car ! get vp1 and see if , even after <NUM> years , it does not hold up ...
let me first say that i 've done this program several times over the past few years , and stayed on it each time for at least <NUM> months . it did not do much for me . my physique did not change , nor did the way i felt . i 'm in good shape anyway , but i certainly did not build muscle mass . as far as strength goes , there 's no possible way to test whether these exercises really build strength or not . i suppose you could subjectively say whether you felt stronger doing day to day activities , or test yourself with weights but neither of those is optimal . i 'd say that if you want to exercise without apparatus , and are interested in improving your appearance , conditioning , energy levels etc that there are more effective ways of doing so . either ross enamait 's books , or combat conditioning and combat abs would be an improvement . i do combat conditioning and combat abs most days and they 've done me a world of good as far as conditioning , strength and flexibility , which are all things miracle seven did not . and , i do n't spend more than <NUM> minutes a day doing them . for all the silly furey marketing techniques ( and he 's as egregious as they come regarding his advertising ) a combination of both of those furey books will do far more for you than miracle seven , which is a very incomplete program that you 'll need to add conditioning and flexibility work to
this is simply a rehash of dr. burns previous writings . if you have read feeling good , it is a waste of money to purchase this book . he covers the same material but change the names the scenerios . he is a one trick pony and clearly has done no more recent research , since the prior books
as a university professor of human resource development and an anglican brother , the amazing power of deliberate intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever . if you enjoy new-age fantasy , get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money . if you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as the rule of benedict : insights for the ages , or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time .. it 's called the bible
i just loved the 1st one but the sequel was just too slow , not very funny and had lost it 's charm . it just has a few memorable scenes
i wanted a good face painting book to use with my three-year-old , but this book was n't much help . it has a good tiger and clown . other faces in the book were either too simple to need directions ( i.e . paint a flag on the cheek ) or too abstract or scary for my little guy
i have read history books more interesting than this book . when i purchased the book i thought that it would be an interesting work . the book started off interesting . then , as it progressed it got worse . rent the movie . it would be much better . trust me
animals should never receive negative punishment ( physical or mental ) . why should you , when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does ? the use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology ( as it is utterly unnecessary ) and a need to be sadistic . as a veterinarian and animal lover , i strongly advise against this book
maybe it 's just me and i 'm expecting so much when i spend my money or a little bit of time listenin ' to these new n * ggas . but i 'm just not feelin ' this s * it here . i fell asleep mid way through this album . i just ca n't seem to understand why these n * ggas is so one dimesional . i cant underdstand why people still supportin ' these n * ggas . not one track was tolerable . if dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s * it away already . word of advice dont buy this .
as other reviewers have been , i 'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements , especially mrs. cheveley 's broach . the effect of removing this element is that it is chiltern who saves goring , not goring who saves chiltern , and the play therefore never gives goring his moment of heroism and nobility . this film is too jolly and innocent . laura cheveley 's hubris , robert chiltern 's anguish , these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on goring , his wit , and his pre-marital uncertainty . i do think the film is entertaining , for what it is worth . anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in wilde will probably enjoy it . if you know this play and oscar wilde well , though , you may be frustrated
let 's start with being the nephew of sigmund freud . mr. bernays witnessed the coming of the industrial revolution in full and his ideas were thus shaped believing that even men operate only as mindless automatons in the larger machinery of society . the author believes that people are incapable of forming their own opinions due to the complexity of modern life . heck , these hickams from topeka just came off the farm . surely we in the elite must help them make their choices . this is the tone of propaganda . keep in mind that also during this time other similar misinformed ideologies were being incubated by bernays contemporaries like hitler and stalin . there is in truth much commonality between all three of these mens views . all ideologies are dangerous and there seemed to have been a great number of squirrely ones developed at the beginning of the 20th century . bernays does have some karma to pay as this book was used by hitler and the third reich as a kind of manual on how to deceive the masses . and the third reich is not the last homeland to use bernays ideas
as you may have been reading in the other reviews , this book is very different . most of the suggestions are wacky , and really could only save you pennies to say the least . once in awhile , the suggestions are okay , if you own a home ( which i do n't because i do n't have money ) but if you followed every suggestion in the book you would be the laughing stock of your community . there are much better books on the market for the purpose this book is supposed to serve . if only they would update it , it would n't be half bad . i mean , they talk about going to the library to use internet when almost everyone has internet on their phones nowadays and other wierd `` hints '' that just do n't make sense . they spend a whole section on just organizing your bills and putting them in places like a shoe organizer or an empty cereal box because this will help you save money . real frugal people would just save their money and skip the book to read something that will actually help you
john carpenter 's ` the fog ' may not be his greatest film , and that is exactly the reason for remaking or improving it . the character of vengeful blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics , and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today 's special effects . revolution studios seems to have thought the same way , but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself . what is wrong ? the answer is clear . that is the film 's incoherent storytelling , which made me dizzy while watching it . the original 's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact , and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town ( or an island ... whatever ) shrouded in a fog . so far , it 's good , but the problem is how to tell this story . apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions . it can sneak into a kitchen , but not a fridge . it can turn a human into a mummy-like corpse in a second , but it uses that trick not much , because it seems to know that the cgi is costly . the lack of consistent logics just helps make the film scare-free . slow and sleep-inducing pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film 's plot . in horror films i usually do n't expect much from the characters , but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid . if you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer , you wo n't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend . forget the law of physics here . if your car crashes , overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea , you would get seriously hurt . not in this film , because of the driver happens to be the star of the film . new version of ` the fog ' is not scary . well , the original was not that scary , but it was moody and stylish . they certainly did change some part of the original , but none of the changes make sense . so ... why did they remake it
this book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter . i have no idea how or why this book ever won an award , unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written . and the illustrations were just as sad
this is a good movie , but the dvd works like a cheap bootleg . my dvd player was fresh out the box and for some odd reason this dvd kept skipping parts of the movie .
this dvd functions more or less as an advertisement for the other snl dvds that have been and continue to be marketed by nbc . the 25th anniversary special on this dvd lasts 2.5 hours , which sounds like a long time , but it 's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time . as uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year , there was still a lot of great material -- far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way . as a result , the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites -- often , just enough to cover a famous quote ( `` wild an crazy guys , '' etc . ) with a touch of lead-in . this may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who 's seen the skits , but that 's about it . when the skits were originally aired , they usually went on too long , but here the dvd 's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction . i 'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of <NUM> years worth of programming that would fit on one dvd , but if it ca n't be done ... maybe one should n't do it . the dvd comes with three `` extras '' : an interview of lorne michaels by tim russert , which is mildly interesting ; the `` day-after '' coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous tv show i never heard of , `` access hollywood '' ; and promotional tv coverage by some other nbc news show , which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the dvd . again i ask : why put this material on a dvd ? the so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party . all in all , disappointing . by the way , for those who care , the beastie boys do n't actually perform a number on the dvd . they play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by elvis costello , and then they end up playing back-up for him
and i guess along , i knew it would be ! ! ! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows . period. ! ! ! there is no .. nor ... ever can be a `` revival '' of the original ... sorry ! `` revival '' was a very forgettable attempt by dan curtis ( genius ) to desparately cling on to an old idea ... and i do n't blame him , cause it ' is my favorite show of all time , but by the <NUM> 's , the people and the mood was altogether different fom the <NUM> 's ... cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber , destined to fail because of that alone ... was time to seal the old coffin up 1n <NUM> ... and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was .
ok , first things first , i never seen the original , so i went into this flick with a clear , open mind . bad move . booooringggg as the day is long , about as scary as an episode of home improvement , suspenseful as an applebee 's commercial . maybe the ending was good , seeing as i only made it through about <NUM> minutes before i had to take it out of my dvd player and sent it spinning frisbee-like across the room . if this was your idea of scary , `` dirty dancing '' must have really freaked you out . ho ho ho
the plot is of this film is built around hal , jack black 's character , being a `` shallow '' beauty obsessed man who one day finds that he is no longer capable of noticing a woman 's exterior appearance . thanks to tony robbins and his neuro-linguistic programming , hal can only see a woman 's internal beauty . is there any legitimacy to such a premise in the first place ? of course not . it 's totally ridiculous . one reason is that obesity correlates with mental disorders like depression and obsession-compulsion . the real question is why are these individuals incapable of controlling their own behavior ? it certainly is n't due to their being more picturesque `` inside '' than the rest of us . more importantly , hal 's true self is far deeper rather than the robbinized one ; we see the hypnotized hal pleasing obese women everywhere while he actively working against his own interests and those of humanity . when he was categorizing women based on their physical fitness and beauty he was practicing a form of selection that allowed us to be among the most successful species on earth . his choice gave him excellent odds of mating with a women who happened to be fertile and also strong enough to survive pregnancy . contrast this with what happened after he was placed under the conjurer 's spell as his reproductive chances immediately evaporated . a porcine woman is one less likely to be fecund , and also one more likely to contract diabetes , hypertension , preeclampsia , and ovarian cancer along with producing babies who are afflicted with omphalocele and various other birth defects . there 's nothing shallow about avoiding obese women . the fact is it 's the height of intelligence . such a predisposition is highly refined and highly recommended . that we have evolved to the point of castigating men who desire healthy mates is merely another indicator of society-wide misandry and our reflexive habit of condemning what is male while fawning over what is female .
i just recently heard `` buffalo stance '' on my local college radio station , and it brought back memories of the first time i heard it in back in the winter of <NUM> . it is n't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then ; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have . but there 's a problem with the overall album of raw like sushi : all the songs that surround `` buffalo stance '' do n't even come close to matching its catchiness . even the inexplicably praised `` manchild '' is dull . find the single for `` buffalo stance '' if you can , and pick up a salt & pepper album as an alternative to raw like sushi .
i am big fan of pax ( armstrong 's company ) and i own her book , cds , and have attended her seminars . i really liked keys to the kingdom in the book version , however , friends and family that listened to the book on cd hated it . not sure why exactly , but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead . also , you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist . hang in there though , because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships . i ca n't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men . did i also mention that apparently alanis morissette is also an armstrong fan ? in a nutshell , get her book , and her other cds like `` in sync with the opposite sex '' . also , her cd `` the amazing development of men '' is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in `` keys to the kingdom '' , which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up . i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released . it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office . if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up . i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either . i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his/her mistake . this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs . wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich ? do we wait until then to change the moral ? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
save your money and just make a guide yourself . this & quot ; discussion guide & quot ; has only one title page and then four pages of large font bare basic summary with a small sprinkling of questions . if you think that this is weak , you will go on to realize that the last of the four pages is even half taken up with the publisher 's logo and information . if you hold the print out close to your ear ... you can hear your money being flushed down the drain ! !
`` houseboat '' never arrived here . i have been patiently waiting at the dock , but no boat . please send it at once
book read fine , but a simple question regarding whether her software plugin was a <NUM> time or monthly fee has gone unanswered <NUM> times via her contact information listed onher website mentioned in the book . makes me wonder how sincere she is
i found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written , but also insidiously demeaning to women . rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships , the author focused on the weakness and instability of women . in addition , his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised ... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage . i found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes . my fiancee and i have read chapman 's five love languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise
i do n't think i 'm going to be around in <NUM> to give an accurate evaluation .i ' f i 'm still here i hope i still remember who neil young is , and i 'm still rocking in the free world
i usually like deaver 's stories , but i actually only made it through half of the book ... then tossed the thing . i am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children ( even if they are at the teen stage ) . should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book . and i definitely do n't need to have obscenities every sentence . my mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say . i find this to be true , even in my choice of literature . my time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material . so i am a prude ... karen sadle
roberts ' the pengin history of europe contains detailed information of european history . beginning with the stone age ending in the 20th century . europes ' influence on government , economics , and religion are covered in detail . greek , roman , asian , italian , germans , russian , and even american history have been influenced by europes will and power . if you are a historian or history professor , roberts ' discussions will have you yearning for more . for us less scholarly students , it is a reader 's nightmare
this movie is the big lie logic attempting to prove itself again . most despotic criminals use a big lie concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which stan `` tookie '' williams is cut . this dvd is nothing more than a big lie ! that ranks right up there with nazi big lie era triumph of the will . like any monster tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart . this dvd should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how big lies told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls . even if stan tookie '' williams is just responsible for `` helping create '' the crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book . that he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on <NUM> minutes , `` convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is , redeemed '' is of no consequence whatsoever . tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods . tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings . tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had . tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order . tookie williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer 's reality . in the end tookie williams got what he deserved a needle ride to hell 's gate if there is any enternal justice . buy this redemption - the stan `` tookie '' williams story dvd if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work . i look at stan tookie william 's and all i see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his `` caged creep conversion '' but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way . when i saw this dvd on stan `` tookie '' williams he reminded me of ernst rohm ) ( 1887-1934 ) , german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa ( brown shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit . ) this is a good dvd because jamie foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic , self absorbed social parasite in redemption - the stan `` tookie '' williams story . if tookie gets a nobel prize i think he should be forced to share it with ernst rohm ) ( 1887-1934 ) , german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa ( brown shirts ) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction , child killing , weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit
there have been a dozen or more & quot ; boy 's books & quot ; lately , most notably the exceptional raising cain , by kindlon and thompson . most of them are not worth the bother , and this compendium is at the top of that list
along with the nanny , the stepdad , the cable guy , the 14-year-old girl with a crush ... we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes , everyone is out to get us .. or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe . i am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality . no wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion , mistrust , fear ( and the resulting isolation ) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us . yes , films like these have their place . however , i think hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality .
reason for my rating is the fact i only got one cd . i mean , <NUM> bucks for one cd is messed up . i guess i bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they did n't put on the description ... oh well . if you got the money and would like to own atleast one of the cd of this album , buy it
this is j.a . jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help
sony botched the <NUM> re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged `` lovin touchin squeezin '' and `` city of the angels '' . they have failed to correct this error with this newer , supposedly `` re-masterd '' version . on the original vinyl release , `` city of the angels '' kicked in before the final chorus of `` lovin touchin squeezin '' had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for `` feelin ' that way/anytime '' on infinity . at the time , some aor radio stations even played these two tracks together . as completely seperate tracks on cd , the famous ending of `` lovin touchin squeezin '' becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly . ultimately , it is only a couple seconds cut off ( reverb echoing to silence ) - but as one of journey 's signature tunes , you 'd think that they 'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release . the original ending of 'lovin touchin squeezin '' ( with final seconds of reverb ) can be heard on the two disc collection , essential journey - but of course , as the set is a collection of radio songs , it does not segue into `` city of the angels '' as it originally did ( and should ) on evolution . a minor point i know . but - sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release . they should take the time to check all the details to get it right . or - why bother
i have nothing but the upmost respect for vinnie paul . it eats me up that he chose this project as his comeback to music . i ca n't think of a musician that would n't have jumped at the chance to be in a band with him . ( zakk wylde , maynard james keynan , hell even matt heafy are a few names that come to mind ) i respect what mudvanye does . they have a formula . not exactly my cup of tea , but it works and it sells records . so why this collaboration ? why now ? i ca n't figure it out . glen tribot and ( insert nothingface guitarist name here ) are not even in dimebag 's shadow . their riffing does n't do vin 's playing any justice and it shows right off the bat . the only part of this album where i hear any real connection is when vinnie is playing the snare and high hat in 4/4 . terrible waste of such an amazing talent . as for the vocals ... some of the screaming works , nothing special , just kinda sounds like mudvayne . but on the slower country influenced songs , i fight every urge to smash this cd into a million pieces . vinnie paul , please find yourself musicians at your skill level and leave the amaeturs in your wake ... if you like mudvayne and enjoyed damageplan ... you will still probably be disapointed with this cd . if you are expecting pantera , as some of these reviews will lead you to believe .. well go throw on trendkill and feel privelaged that you were able to experience metal at its finest .
after reading this book , i would like to make three points about it : <NUM> . ) first of all , do n't make this your first dean koontz book . this is the second book of the so-called christopher snow trilogy . read the first book in the trilogy first -- fear nothing . the first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book . <NUM> . ) second , please be aware that koontz has yet to write the third book in the christopher snow trilogy . this is a real shame , because seize the night ends on a cliffhanger of sorts . koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday , under the title ride the storm . but since it 's been over eight years since koontz has written a snow novel , i would n't expect this book anytime soon . <NUM> . ) third , i must admit i did n't really care for this book at all , and i say that as a koontz fan . lots of padding -- the action does n't really start until page <NUM> . koontz wastes a lot of space repeating things he originally wrote in fear nothing . i found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts . the plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel , killer monkeys , alternate realities , serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that 's just the tip of the iceberg ! even the characters in the book do n't seem to take any of it seriously . all the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic . i was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book . it was just too silly for my tastes . koontz is a great writer , but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable , fast-paced plot . instead of this book , i would therefore recommend watchers , intensity , odd thomas or velocity .
when i found `` hour game '' in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale , i thought i had hit pay dirt . but i can not believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as `` the winner '' and `` absolute power '' could turn out such a dog . long , boring , and confusing . i fear that mr. baldacci hired an `` aspiring young writer '' to `` help '' him crank out a quick book . i can not pass this book along to my friends -- i could n't do that to them . it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin . what a waste . what a shame .
as if toxicity wasnt mediocre enough , this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it . where do we place the blame ? is it darons poor songwriting skills ? or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible mtv-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up ? or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and tv ? whichever one you choose , this is not the soad we all love , this is an unoriginal rehash of toxicity . oh wow , they have an anti-government song ? so what , who hasnt made one of those . and anti-war songs ? travel back to the 60s , they were chock full full of them . everything i hear is uninspired and downright lazy . its also unfortunate that serj got sidelined by daron `` i wish i had talent '' malakian , for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs , while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have adhd in your classroom that are just seriously not funny . maybe im being to harsh , but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure , and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics . you want to get good music , get soad 's self titled , its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as mtv .
there is a reason why you can not listen to any tracks on amazon- you would n't buy if you could . i read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way . this band is nothing even near metallica . i have thrown the disk away- do n't bother
alright , let 's do this one up on the bounce and by the numbers : <NUM> ) bridget fonda is red-smoking hot . fire-breathing dragon hot . albeit in an angular , toothy kind of wait , which , do n't get me wrong , is just fine . <NUM> ) bridget fonda plays maggie , who , with some pantera-lovin ' buds break into a pharmacy to get a little better living through pharmacology , unleash a little jihad on the owner , and get themselves into a firefight . everybody gets riddled with bullets , except maggie , who , in the wretched bowels of withdrawal and all-twitchy-like , greases a cop . <NUM> ) note : did i mention that `` point of no return '' is a big-studio remake of luc besson 's utterly insane , bump-n-grind brutal , deliciously bleak and nihilistic `` nikita '' ? i did not ? shoot me . no , no , put down that steyr sniper rifle , i 'm kidding there cowboy , sheesh ... <NUM> ) with that in mind , all you need to know is this : studio director john badham ( who directed , ummm , the cinematic marvels `` bird on a wire '' and `` short circuit '' , which proves he 's a real , er , edgy dude ) churned out what amounts to a shot-for-shot remake of `` nikita '' . only it 's like the carbon dioxide remake of `` nikita '' : odorless , colorless , and tasteless . <NUM> ) alright : so maggie gets hauled into a supermax facility , deep-sixed by the government , manhandled a little too much by super-duper-secret agent bob ( gabriel byrne , starting his slow slide from sneering , edgy brilliance into avuncular b-movie actor hell ) , erased from the big book of life and super-shuttled down a little orwellian `` memory-hole '' , and offered a choice : society made you , baby . now we 'll give you your murder <NUM> training , and you can be a sanctioned killer . <NUM> ) that 's about it . it 's basically `` nikita '' , without the hip and happening and totally ominous techno-score , without luc besson 's surreally grim edginess and sublime cinematography , with new orleans dubbing for nice ( without even the fun of a hurricane , or a shoot-out at the superdome , which might have enlivened this turd ) . it 's like `` nikita '' with all the fun and style and gratuitous killing bled out . <NUM> ) that said , fonda looks good writhing around on a bed in her hello kitty panties . <NUM> ) oh , and harvey keitel shows up in an enzo ferrari , i think , though i was way too liquored up by then to care . do you care ? he 's channeling the terminator by way of a tax accountant , and was way too goofy to live . <NUM> ) the original `` nikita '' showed me something i 'd never seen before : an indonesian diplomat literally getting flushed down a toilet . this one showed me something i 've seen many times : an edgy , nasty , grimy , kinetic foreign flick getting flushed down the remake toilet . terminate with extreme prejudice . js
i 'm a huge tom berenger fan but i simply ca n't say anything good about this film . the plot is horrible , the acting unconvincing ( even berenger ) , the dialouge laughable and the ending , well , sour to say the least . the pits
i 've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code ' . this band was just getting worse with every album . eventually , i caught on and stopped wasting my $ . i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright . who the @ $ # % @ are these dumb reviewers ? are they getting paybacks ? is this politics or music ? live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that . they still know how to play , but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive , appealing songs . also , maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich is n't helping ! only put <NUM> song on my mp3 players ... = <NUM> star
in my opinion , hank williams jr. - when he did it right - was about as good as it gets in country music . you listen to his records like `` old habits '' and `` whiskey bent & hell bound '' and it is hard to get much better than that . but with this album hank jr started showing glimpses of what would become his future ... and it 's not good . he has a terrible version of `` the tennessee stud '' and everything just seems so overdone . he 's best on songs like `` i do n't care if tomorrow never comes '' , `` ramblin my shoes '' and `` all my rowdy friends have settled down '' - everything else is just filler . and with future albums the filler would get worse until he eventually got to the point he would write things like `` this ai n't dallas '' and `` fax me a beer '' . too bad , terrible waste of talent .
this cd was somewhat of a dissapointment . was n't as good as i thought it would be . was okay but definitely not one of my better christmas cd 's
what a disappointment ! it is only lacking cartoon illustrations to make it seem competely childish . but more disturbingly it is deceptively simplistic . told through rose-colored glasses , leaving out what is convenient to ensure a `` happy '' ending . save your money , wait for it on vue-master
this book was very disappointing . i loved her 1st two books . so when this book came out i was very excited . after reading it , i found it was rather dull and not very funny . there were very few parts that actually made me laugh , unlike her 1st two books
oh , i see ... issue the original uk version with <NUM> songs , but leave off the u.s. version <NUM> or so songs ? and you have plenty of room to fit them all ( because the u.s. version clocks in at under <NUM> minutes , so adding <NUM> more tracks would have been a piece of cake ) ? just more scumbag tactics from record companies reissuing cd 's . strummer is rolling in his grave . just say no , and stop buying the music from these scam record companies . if you must buy used , so they wo n't get your dough !
i have not yet received the dvd , and i contacted the customer 's service last month . they sent me a new shipment , but i am still waiting for it
censored & quot ; bits & quot ; of lenny bruce . his earliest work , but not nearly as great as he was to become . has some great stuff but not really his best work . get a live performance for the real reason people love lenny
it looks cute ( like martha stewart 's magazines ) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice . since most of us only do this once , there is not too much personal experience to draw from . therefore we look to the professionals for ideas , sample wording and help . this was total waste of time unless i was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle
trash sells and this is the definition of trash . unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction . shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research . readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write
there is no doubt that sun tzu 's little book on war is an enduring classic , but this little edition is ridiculous . there is a reason it is so cheap . it is all of <NUM> pages long , including the introduction . if you are going to take the trouble to buy and read sun tzu 's masterpiece , you should at least get a version that explains what sun tzu was really talking about . the best translation is by giles , as is this , but in the original giles translation there is a running commentary , between the lines by giles and several classical chinese scholars , explaining both the context and meaning of the text . it is virtually impossible to really appreciate what sun tzu was talking about without the background that the original giles translation provides . there are several editions of the full giles edition available . any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version . the best is the special edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version , like this edition , in addition to the chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation . sometimes you really do get what you pay for
poor singers , annoying sound effects in what some people call songs . their voices are just auful at times , like a sqeaky old granma . god i hate this album
imagine writing a book by simply stringing quotes and references together with your literary contribution limited to connecting verbs and you have this book in a nutshell ! maybe i would have liked it if the author had titled it , frontsoldaten : the book of quotes
in his book , the four agreements , don miguel ruiz , embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life . he says that we should be impeccable with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our best . the basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents . he calls this process `` domestication '' ( p. <NUM> ) . ruiz says that <NUM> % of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection . the agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives . while there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book , some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what i would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion . in some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims ; however , in looking further , he takes some of the passages from the bible out of context . some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas , but i would think most of us by a young age , should already an understanding of these principles . although his book has been highly rated , i hold the position that mr. ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer , therefore , losing good standing with me as a reader . according to ruiz , as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs . when we go against the rules we are punished ( or rewarded for compliance ) . the fear of rejection leads us to agree with , or become something that we are not . in essence , we become a carbon copy of someone else , such as our parents . he says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements . he boldly states , lacking statistical data to back it up , that <NUM> % of our beliefs are based upon a lie ( <NUM> ) . the implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless , `` domesticated '' individuals , hurting ourselves , judging and victimizing other people along the way . this kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives . by his interpretation , if <NUM> % of what we believe is a lie , then <NUM> % of what our parents taught us is also a lie . i would disagree . there are many people who exist today as viable , productive members of society who i 'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else 's beliefs and values . if these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves , by his interpretation , we do n't need parents , teachers , or leaders . he undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path , which i believe is our right of passage . by his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny . instead , we become victims of it . one of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement , be impeccable with your word ; however , he misquotes the bible ( john 1:1 ) when he says `` in the beginning was the word and the word was with god , and the word was god . '' he uses it to epitomize the use of `` word '' as in what one speaks ( <NUM> ) . looking a little further down in that passage , it also says `` the word was made flesh and dwelt among us '' . this passage is not talking about a form of speech , or speaking , but rather `` jesus christ '' . christ became flesh and dwelt among us . in that same chapter he says that `` sin begins with rejection of yourself '' ( <NUM> ) . however , in christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law ( <NUM> john 3:4 ) and that sin is neglecting to do god 's will ( james 4:7 ) . it 's not about self , but about disobeying god 's ordinances . while i agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for , this is not a new concept . most children have learned by the age of <NUM> that if you do n't have something nice to say , do n't say it at all . in his second agreement , do n't take anything personally ; he says that nothing people do is because of you . while this is true to some degree , he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head , it was nothing personal . so in essence , when mary jo buttafuoco was shot by amy fisher , her expression of displeasure regarding amy 's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to ruiz `` you are dealing with yourself , not me '' ( <NUM> ) . no , realistically , mary jo buttafuoco was shot because amy fisher wanted her dead . this kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims . as an american , i 'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally . according to mr. ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism . it seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach , that i would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism . when my college writing professor , gave me his opinion regarding my work , if i were following the authors line of reasoning , i would believe that my professor was `` trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage '' as mr. ruiz suggests ( <NUM> ) . i would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer . another agreement is about not making assumptions in life . he says when we make assumptions , in essence , we create unnecessary drama . unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible . assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason ; even within the scientific community a hypothesis ( or assumption ) is formed in order to test a theory . in order come to school each day i must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree , and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday . in his forth agreement , always do your best , he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements , stating they will only work if you do your best . again , these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned . while ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas , his concepts begin to unravel when he does n't back up his statements with facts , but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion . i ca n't completely discount everything that he says , but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations .
this is a collection of the cream of the cream of the great american songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to american culture . this rate # <NUM> is to express my deep deception about the successful album series . over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully . i am not a dictator but i would vote for a law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of american culture . more than that , the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way . that 's the deal : there is truth missing , there is a sensation of a money-make production . mellow and arrangements , neglectable performances , lacking creativeness . to be completely forgotten some years ahead .
gonzalez 's `` flash professional <NUM> '' underscores a deficiency common to many flash instructional texts , where they spend half the book examining very basic subjects such as timeline-based animation and drawing tools . granted , this book does a nice job illustrating some basics to flash , but the level of discourse here does not inspire conceptual creativity . good books should lead to greater things , and not simply review the same basic subjects discussed since flash <NUM> . one reason why books like this exist is that flash is poorly documented out of the box . yet any decent used book on flash mx will upstage this one . while this book may lack instructional spirit , the most glaring omission is found in its actionscript chapter . ever since mx , the emphasis behind flash has been the power and flexibility of actionscript . granted , actionscript has become rather complicated , but a good author should at least prime the reader to the coding power available in flash <NUM> . instead , we 're treated to a weak smattering of script usage , without touching on the real power behind flash today : classes and object-oriented structure . as if that deficiency were n't glaring enough , the author provided examples of button coding that were outdated since flash <NUM> ! there is no excuse for such weak writing . you the reader deserve a better challenge to expand and hone your flash skills . i 'm giving this book special scrutiny because lynda weinman 's textbooks have such visibility and apparent acclaim . while her books may be well marketed , they are n't always the best use of your money -- or time spent reading . let me suggest a few texts which i have read personally and can recommend . if you want a good beginner guide , check out russell chun 's `` visual quickpro '' flash books . more inspiring , project-related books are found under the friends of ed publishing line by sham bhangal . the most detailed and authoritative books i 've read are colin moock 's definitive guides , the other texts by o'reilly , especially those which touch on oop in detail . the last ones are tough at first , but they really open you up the power of flash . and that in-depth actionscript power is what your future employers will be looking for . good luck .
overall a bad buy ! horrible dvd mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that do n't work . the movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it , but nothing really `` finished . '' the extended scenes are n't scored , which is really distracting because i could n't stop thinking about the great `` mondo bongo '' song that should have been there during the alternate ending , et al ! do n't bother with this one ... check out the directors cuts of `` kingdom of heaven '' ( amazing ! ) and `` king arthur '' - they 're both very worthwhile
i would have given this film <NUM> stars if possible . this film was long , boring , and painful to watch . if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films , do not be deceived by this one ; it is nothing like those types of films
this is a very old book ( <NUM> ? ) and have no much more that a hundred pages . have only a little utility for teorical learning about old clocks . today is practicaly useless . este libro trata el tema de arreglar viejos relojes antiguos , aquellos de pared o repisa de forma muy superficial . cuando se empieza a poner interesante se acaba el libro
please do not compare this with clock work orange . it 's shame . this movie is shame on director . cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good . this movie is like b grade stuff . plot is good , but not the direction or screen play
the title of the riddle of the sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a british traitor . that 's the gist of the novel . but what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang , garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail . understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal . the writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance . this is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism , if i ever saw on
this album features 70s re-recordings of et 's hits . his texas troubodors at the time were a good band , but ernest 's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then . you can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of ernest 's hits on the hall of fame series . even the <NUM> remakes originally on the decca/mca & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; and & quot ; ernest tubb story & quot ; were pretty good ... but this album is for completists only
ok i love everything else i have ever read by dara joy , so when i picked this one up i thought i would be in for a good read . now normally i 'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before i know it the sun is coming up and i 'm wishing 'why ca n't anything like that ever happen to me ' ... well it took three days to force myself through this one and once i was done , instead of wishing i was the herione caught up in some adventure , i was pretty happy just to be me . i could not get close to the characters , or into the story surrounding them . and what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential ... haunted manors , kitchen ghosts ... i guess i 'm even more disappointed because i really do enjoy dara 's other works . if you are going to check this one out i would suggest buying it used
i just read the divide by the author of the horse whisperer , and i wanted to share my opinion of the horse whisperer . i did not read the book ; i saw the movie , a couple of years ago . i just remember it being very hoakie , one of the worst movies i had ever seen . i know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public , but i did not share this enthusiasm . do n't waste your time on this ridiculous movie
this book is written more like a textbook and unless you have a degree in criminal justice or something of that nature , it reads like stereo instructions ! not impressed at all
this stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from <NUM> `` pearl harbour '' starring ben affleck . the acting is wooden and forgettable , the action sequences are humorous at best , and the direction is ... well , let 's just say , director tony bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in `` barb wire '' . the directing style seems to be ... throw in as much loud music as possible , add a heaping helping of a lame love story , toss on some of the worst , most embarrassing lines imaginable , and let 's not forget those all important cgi effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of ww1 flying action since the three stooges . if you want to watch real ww1 flying action with real ww1 biplanes , check out `` the blue max '' . that movie used real ww1 vintage aircraft , that actually have weight to them and do not perform impossible flying stunts that the blue angels do not even attempt using fa-18 jets . pacing is terribly frantic , music is insufferable , character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent . pass this one by , unless you 're willing to spend <NUM> hours viewing an all too typical expensive , wasteful , useless , hollywood blockbuster bomb
if you 're looking for something groundbreaking like b : tas or `` the new batman adventures , '' you 'll have to look elsewhere . `` the batman '' is nothing new . in fact , it 's the kind of saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80 's . this re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great . no longer are the villains multi-layered and complex ; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero . further , batman mythos mainstay james gordon is abandoned in favor of two `` hipper '' more `` kid-friendly '' replacements that serve the same function . on the plus side , the animation is good ; but it is still not enough to make up for the series ' shortcomings . i understand the second season was better , but if so , they must have made some major changes . all in all , a disappointment .
this book is very hard to read . excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text . i am going to finish it as an exercise in tenacity
supposed to be new ! had circular scratches on it upon opening . would not play . dvd player gave message - `` disc damaged or dirty ''
if this album had `` desperately '' on it from `` stick it to ya '' , i would 've bought it in a second . that 's the best song on that album , a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless . and with <NUM> tunes coming from that album ( as well as <NUM> from its follow up `` the wild life '' ) , you would 've thunk that `` desperately '' would 've made the cut over ho-hum songs like `` she wants more '' or `` you are the one '' . as such , skip this one , the songs from `` the wild life '' are n't that great anyway . get `` stick it to ya '' instead , it 's a better best-of slaughter collection than this one
this is the first movie review i have ever written . i wish i could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic ... like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire . wait , it gets worse ... i actually bought this piece of camel dung .. .. i am going to loan it to a prick at work that i hate ! no , i 'll give it to him and refuse to take it back ... hurry , go see it !
i had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while , being a big sellers fan and a ringo/beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie . it is neither . perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself . the idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both sellers and starr to shine , but the script and story ( what there was of it ) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to . one strange setting after another ends anti-climatically , which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity . it really does seem that they `` wrote '' it as they went along , if there was anything written at all . and one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed
one start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific facts about the ebola , but very weak regarding origin of the virus , very unconvincing about possible `` theories '' . sound more like that old music of desinformation , he almost blame another monkey for the ebola like they did before with hiv ..
what 's wrong with this show ? <NUM> . jim wears the same pants , coat , and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series . <NUM> . a slow , sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums . <NUM> . wo n't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her ? <NUM> . do you really believe that this middle-aged , heavy fellow would drive a firebird - a tight fitting car ? <NUM> . angel ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
first off , terrible acting . it seems so unreal . it 's just like nine four year olds playing hide and go seek . paris 's character jo gets killed in the first fifteen minutes after getting a bath , which i can only imagine how much she loved flaunting that body of hers . : ( the only thing interesting was the hot british and scottish actor guys ! other than that , lame lame lame ! !
this film represents the low point in the splashy grable musicals released by twentieth century fox during the war . the story/script is really appalling and bruce humberstone , a frequently poor director , adds nothing . grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer . as far as plot , that is about it . in typical fox fashion , the colour and sound are excellent . grable looks attractive but the makeup is quite heavy , particularly the bleached blonde hair . she was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this . one would hope that martha raye and joe e brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting . most of the songs are lousy too - duds like `` do n't carry tales '' . two redeeming feature - the song `` once too often '' as hermes pan and grable perform a tame apache dance and the title tune , nicely sung by grable in close up . the film represents hollywood cynicism at its worst . fox built a film around grable 's status as the pin up of world war <NUM> but neglected to give her a script or a decent leading man . not to worry , the public will come anyway and , of course , so they did . in the long run , though , junk like this chips away at the reputation of this appealing star who barely holds the film together by sheer star quality , her pretty face and her sense of humour . if you are not an ardent grable fan , you 'll hate the film . `` pin up girl '' really supports the view that betty grable made poor films which do n't warrant revival . in fact many of them are first rate entertainments but certainly not this one ! it should , however , be noted that the print of the film in this dvd is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the hidden hollywood series
my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor . it 's all style , no substance . i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks , long slow camara pans across stephen dorff 's very trendy and stylish haircut , and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with . despite the very art-house feel of it , the story is lost , the viewer is never quite sure if the `` philosophy '' of the main character is meant to be taken seriously , and the style is nothing we have n't seen done better other places . all in all , i found it pretty vapid , painfully slow , and incredibly frustrating , because there is a good movie in here somewhere , if only the script had gone to someone else to make . on a side note , toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser , which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went
this type of music is like a blister on the brain . you ca n't get rid of it and it is irritating . yes , this is the problem with most fm radio when this cd from <NUM> years ago is still getting played . and the tune to `` this love '' is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word . moron <NUM> rank up there with gwen stefani and black eyes peas for most annoying , successful artists
my kids started reading the left behind kids books , and because i was concerned about the message and theology of the books , i started reading them also . then i decided to check out the `` adult '' books from the library . i am a born-again , pentacostal believer in jesus christ , and parts of the theology are not what i read in the bible . ok . i can stil enjoy a good book , one with interesting characters , realistic dialogue , and a good plot . the issue of plot is difficult for the left behind books , i admit , because we know who wins if we 've read the end of the new testament . as to the rest , it fell flat . most of the dialogue did n't ring true . after a few of the books , i was interested in some of the characters , but by the end of the books , there were only a few of the original characters left , and they were some of the least interesting to begin with . how many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in revelation ? how many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in book <NUM> ? there is nothing new and interesting in this book . the last book is just boring . it would have been nice , at the end of the book , to wrap up everything . jesus comes back , and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over , right ? some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all . it was an incredible let down . i felt like i had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over . nothing . we stick with that one main guy , and everyone else is left in the dust . it should have had a really , really happy ending , but even that was boring . if i had my time back , i would stick to the kid versions , if only to discuss theological issues with my children . at least in the kid books , the sermons are shorter . and i will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series
i like dennis hopper and love frederick forrest . neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with . they seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines . sad to see such great talents wasted in a film filled with gratuitous violence and terrible `` pop psychology '' dialogue . was there a point to this film
... because i still have n't received it ! first time amazon 's let me down , though
i 've heard mr. ziglar speak in person and he was very humerous and captivating . wish i could say the same of his autobiography . he detailed his youth and his family to the boring extreme . he spoke very little about the type of work he does now - only about all the job changes he went through . maybe i expected too much ; but after hearing this man in person i expected much more
the dvd has a very poor recording , you ca n't hear the audio because it continue to break and the picture freezes . i have a return tag for the frist one that was n't playing .i just want to notified you that i am going to return both dvd . i will suggest that next one will be tested and make sure is playing very well in video and audio . thank you .
i 'm a cho fan , and consider `` i 'm the one that i want '' to be just about the best stand-up act ever made ... if you like cho , you definitely have to see that one , her first release . this second one is quite possibly the worst stand-up act ever made . the lady definitely goes to extremes . where to begin ? the lighting is poor , she looks like she 's had a few too many , her jokes are stale reruns , and she 's just plain off . i do n't know what happened here , but she obviously does not understand the concept of quality control . i made a special trip to atlanta to see this one , being a big fan , and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve never again to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on dvd and i can rent them cheaply . because , most movies are crap ! two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up dvd
listening to this album puzzled me . i went into it ... backwards , i liked greyboy 's later stuff , so i figured i 'd check out this band . i was disappointed . this is really groovy and the musicians are n't bad , but it 's like one of those jam band things . i do n't mind jam bands , but their sound is too loosely wrought for me . and there is a little too much noodling with instruments that seems a little aimless . if you like the greyboy allstars , you will probably like this . but if you are buying this for greyboy , do n't
i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film . but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy , i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor . over-zealous and fanatic ( as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the protestant/catholic conflict ) , she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes . and throughout the film , there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever . i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived , i would recommend the superb bbc series , elizabeth r with glenda jackson . and if you want even further background , look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell . tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary , queen of scots ( although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example , mary stuart and elizabeth never met , although it was mary 's great desire ) and even another title , anne of the thousand days . those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times . this film just does n't cut it
i bought this cd because it got a lot of good reviews , and the description sounded like something i would enjoy . however , it turned out to be an atrocious cd . it is very repetitive and monotonous throughout . the songs pretty much all sound the same . there 's little melodic variation , and the vocals have basically no range . the lyrics are extremely uninspired . i 'm glad i bought this used at a cheap price . i do n't know if i 'm going to give it away or just throw it away ; it 's that bad .
<NUM> 1/2 competent though disappointing , this highly referenced trance album can not escape it 's plodding , dated backbone of a beat , no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be . of course , listening to the album <NUM> years later , one immediately feels the bland , aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality , which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in house-centric circles that is . the thudding , ever present , 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper , rendering most of the yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal . thankfully once in a while , particularly at the start and finish of the disc , a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions , allowing dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways
i am quite dissappointed in this cd , being won over by the sound bytes that i sampled here at amazon , which are very beautiful . imagine listening to one of the samples presented here <NUM> times in a row . the sample represents the whole of the song , which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top . to me , this signifies a lack of creativity . there is so much potential in each of these songs , but it is as if avishai wrote <NUM> measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song . maybe my expectations were too high , expecting a billy childs type of song structure . i will be looking at selling my cd so i can recoup at least a portion of my investment
note to soundtrack producers : when we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs , we want to hear the songs . sure , a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun , but not when it 's cut into the music ! ( see the soundtrack to `` jay & silent bob strike back '' for how to do it right . ) basically , what they 've done here , is try to create some new experience that is n't quite the movie and is n't quite the soundtrack . you do n't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them . the beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog . it 's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot . the dialog runs into the song , which runs into the dialog , which runs into the song , which runs into the dialog , etc. , throughout the entire cd . on the first listen , you think , `` oh , yeah , ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'white lines . ' that was funny ... , '' but then you 're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their , `` ... diggeda , diggeda , diggeda ... '' bit right into the middle of the song . if you truly want to hear 'white lines ' or any of the other tunes , you 'll have to get them elsewhere . sorry . i 'm not sure what the objective was with this disc , but if i wanted to relive the movie , i 'd pop in the dvd . if i wanted to hear the songs , i would have liked to have played the cd , but that wo n't work here . the songs and the movie dialog on this cd are like siamese twins sharing a single stomach . you get one , you get the other and there 's no separating them . this is a bummer since they 're good songs . what i 've got now is a cd novelty that i really ca n't use . i may trot it out once a year , but i 'll be disappointed every time . maybe i 'll sell it on ebay ..
i like marlee matlin and some of the other dvds in the baby einstein series so was looking forward to this one . it is unfortunately not that great for teaching sign language ( i prefer both `` my baby can talk '' and `` signing time '' ) . the worst part of it is how long a child has to wait for the actual content ; there is no way to skip the commercial for `` disney 's little einsteins ''
everybody i know loves this film . in today 's environment , when wkw is being hailed as the premier director from asia , and one of the world 's best , i do n't know how many really actually love the film , and how many do n't have the courage to state a contrary opinion . make no mistake , i think wkw is one of the greatest directors i have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like `` in the mood for love '' ( itmfl ) not be ? actually , his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like itmfl , but in his versatility . it is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both itmfl and chungking . well , his greatness notwithstanding , i ca n't stand this film . and no , i ca n't sit , lie , or do anything else with it either . so what is it about this movie which gets my goat ? the directorial style , and the cinematography . actually , i think parts of the latter are great , and the parts i do n't like are influenced by the former , so let me just talk about the former . wkw uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films , including `` happy together '' and `` fallen angels '' ( yes , i 've seen all of them , and hate almost all of them uniformly ) . the hallmark of this style is a very modern , staccato , piecemeal approach , stringing together relatively disparate ideas , scenes , or action sequences ( almost reminiscent of godard 's `` breathless '' , as the editorial review says here , though not quite ) . his style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example , the slow shutter speed effect . actually , this is one of his peeves , which even spills over to itmfl , where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb . having watched nearly all his films , and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism , and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme , i can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage . it gets used for dream-like sequences , for grounded reality ; for sentimental togetherness , for aloofness ; for tears , for laughter ; for thoughts , for action ; the list goes on . wkw similarly uses other weapons in his vast director 's repertoire to some bizarre effects , taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory . the above notwithstanding , let me round off by saying that if the kind of style i have delineated above appeals to you , then you should definitely watch this film , for outside of his jarring style , wkw has pieced together a great story and actors . as for myself , i will continue to watch every one of his films , living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love , or hate .
the trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money , attention , and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the `` tribute '' to ; and often , the results do n't come close to measuring up to the originals . such , i 'm afraid , is the case with the <NUM> common threads album , where nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the hotel california for most of the 1970s , the eagles . the brainchild of eagles manager irving azoff , who saw how revered the band had become amongst the nashville hierarchy of the nineties , common threads also functioned as a charity album , whose profits went to the walden woods project , of which eagles drummer don henley was a particularly prominent supporter . were it not for that one particular aspect , common threads would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type . even as this album already stands , however , and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the eagles to reunite , the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did . what seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the eagles ' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done ; one listen to travis tritt 's version of `` take it easy '' , and vince gill 's take on `` i ca n't tell you why '' seems to indicate this . in other cases , they sound terribly anemic , as in clint black 's version of `` desperado '' , where he sounds like second-rate john denver ( and i think john denver could have done this far better than clint black ) . and hearing faux-eagles wanna-bes like little texas doing `` peaceful easy feeling '' and diamond rio doing `` lyin ' eyes '' is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing . the womenfolk do n't have it much easier either . lorrie morgan simply sounds out of place on `` the sad cafe '' , seemingly not having any idea about the song 's mournful inspiration ; and tanya tucker 's toughness on `` already gone '' is quite dull . suzy bogguss ' take on `` take it to the limit '' is a bit better , but it wo n't make anyone forget the randy meisner-led original . and trisha yearwood 's version of `` new kid in town '' is okay , but she sounds like she 's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol linda ronstadt would , and it 's not totally successful either . in the end , the inability of contemporary nashville artists to really understand the eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the eagles ' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary music row does things . though classified as `` country-rock '' , the eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass , surf-rock , r & b , disco , and even tex-mex a time or two , styles that are largely alien to contemporary nashville . as linda herself , around whom the eagles originally formed in <NUM> , has said , it is a part of the diverse spectrum of california music : `` california music is a real hybrid , very specialized , and it does n't have anything to do with nashville . '' this is something that i 'm not sure these artists really understand , and why i ca n't give this album a better rating
i do n't know what happened with this effort . i have yet to stop listening to hellbilly deluxe and sinister urge . however , i have listened to educated horses ( through ) once , maybe twice . i just can not make myself listen to it . and that is really sad because i love rob zombie and his music
i 've read all of iris johansen 's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them -- this , however was not one of them . i found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book . what mysterious event happened to jock and royd ? who is macduff -- well if you have n't read the previous novel , you 'll never know
i found this book to be a real disappointment . for starters , lamb is a journalist rather than a scholar . nothing wrong with that , except for the fact that much of the book reads like a `` travelogue '' based on anecdotes and personal encounters rather than a serious analysis of the arab world . he certainly does not have the historical perspective or depth of knowledge of a true middle east expert such as bernard lewis . this book might be somewhat informative to those just beginning to learn about the arab world . but certainly there must be better `` beginner '' books out there . lamb also appears to have a very limited knowledge of factual information about the region , especially historical facts , as demonstrated by the substantial number of errors in the book . for example , he describes ancient egypt and mesopotamia as being arab accomplishments . but these civilizations did n't consider themselves to be arabs and certainly did n't speak the arabic language , which lamb himself later describes as the best criteria for determining who is arab and who is not . the truth is that the arabs were largely confined to the arabian peninsula until muhammad , in the early <NUM> 's , united the arab tribes under islam and began the wars of conquest which were to eventually bring the arabic language to what is now considered to be the arab world , including egypt and iraq . finally , the original edition of this book was written in <NUM> . the <NUM> edition has been partially updated . but much of the book is still outdated . for instance , his writings on the political violence that wrecked lebanon in the <NUM> 's . the arab world is a fascinating place . please do it justice by finding a better book .
i am very upset - i bought all three and no onscreen lyrics - why would i buy a karaoke cd without them ? i feel that i just wasted <NUM> dollars
i have to admit that i had not really listened to mika before i saw him in concert in stockholm . he does what he does reasonably well for this genre . good falsetto voice although it gets a bit loud and annoying during the show . here is what made me lose all respect for this artist . during his show in stockholm he only played for <NUM> minutes , including an encore . i am sorry , but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing <NUM> minutes . overall i would say ok voice , pretty weak songwriting , and pathetic live show . i lost what little respect i gained for mika during the first few songs . weak , weak , weak .
laura esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate , magical novel . lumi cavazos is a likeable tita , struggling with her forbidden passion for pedro.she 's a sympathetic character & conveys her pain with her eyes.for a talented actress , i wonder what has become of her since . marco leonardi is not as sympathetic as pedro.he comes across as a cheating scoundrel , causing pain for both his wife & his forbidden lover.one wonders why tita loves him so much , except that it 's forbidden.marco leonardi is , however , being true to the book.he uses tita for his own pleasure ; instead of bravely marrying her , he is a coward in marrying her sister & cheating on her . the movie renders less magical , or powerful , the scenes in the book.instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti western.one expects to see john wayne riding to tita 's rescue . the magical scenes are hardly convincing , even for their time.the movie does have an excellent soundtrack.it 's far inferior to the delectable , sensual novel
& quot ; my reflections & quot ; dvd is much better as it is a concert . this dvd is a bunch of videos and interviews . not a keeper . rent in first .
after i heard this cd i bought gershwin plays gershwin on the naxos label which ar n't piano rolls . any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and ca n't be played by a pianists with two hands . on the naxos album that has some of these same songs gershwin 's actual playing does n't sound very good . many of gershwins contempories such as james p. johnson , eubie blake , luckey roberts and even zez confrey were much better pianists than he was , however they did n't have his melodic gifts as a composer . i would recommend artis whodhouse's transcriptions of jelly roll morton 's piano rolls ( on the same label ) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion morton was a better musician in every way than gershwin .
boring on disc ... not a true musical theatre score at all ! not disney 's best effort , but it will be a cash cow . visually interesting on stage , but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line . kids will love it
this is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer , keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans . the characters in this story were likable . i enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view . i liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times . however , i found much of the story to be utterly predictable . from the moment i started reading , i could tell exactly how tibby 's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the `` cool '' kids would turn out . i also knew what would happen when bee tracked down her grandmother . carmen 's mother 's relationship followed an equally predictable arc . although the characters were good , i found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest
this is a good example of rap today . you do n't need to be a mc to land a deal , or even know how to rhyme . all you need to do is come up with a dance move , make songs about your damn clothes and how you party all the time and your on . this ai n't right man ... it just ai n't right ! !
when it 's sweltering here in our palm springs desert paradise , clothing optional settings and activities are a natural for many locals and visitors . so if it 's summer and you live here , odds are that you 're already naked as you read this . in the soothing nude yoga & tai chi ( $ <NUM> ) , five buck-naked youngish women go through relatively easy yoga and tai chi routines . to someone who is an amateur of both disciplines , the yoga seemed superior to the tai chi . when this title was first released on home video , it was criticized by some hard core feminists as merely another excuse to exploit naked women with large , augmented , breasts and that it 's nothing more than soft core titillation . maybe and maybe not . since sexual energy is an element of yoga ( remember madonna 's suggestive yoga poses in w magazine ? ) , if this digital routine arouses , perhaps that 's just an added bonus . the low key elevator music and the almost hypnotic , non-intrusive narration make this a nice morning or evening routine to either get the blood flowing or to wind down . not rated : full frontal nudity ( sometimes with socks ) . genre : exercise . <NUM> minutes .
as if toxicity wasnt mediocre enough , this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it . where do we place the blame ? is it darons poor songwriting skills ? or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible mtv-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up ? or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and tv ? whichever one you choose , this is not the soad we all love , this is an unoriginal rehash of toxicity . oh wow , they have an anti-government song ? so what , who hasnt made one of those . and anti-war songs ? travel back to the 60s , they were chock full full of them . everything i hear is uninspired and downright lazy . its also unfortunate that serj got sidelined by daron `` i wish i had talent '' malakian , for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs , while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have adhd in your classroom that are just seriously not funny . maybe im being to harsh , but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure , and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics . you want to get good music , get soad 's self titled , its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as mtv .
this book uses a lot of buzz words and offers very little substantial advice when it comes to actually designing your own house . it touches a little on straw bale and reused materials and barely grazes cob/clay/rammed earth . it does n't even mention geodesic domes as far as i can tell . the book advocates on one page ( p.72 ) that people should live in small humble buildings , only having the square footage they absolutely need . then a few pages later ( p.79 ) it shows a 4000+ sq . ft. home , with the title `` an excersize in efficiency . '' i fail to see anything efficeint about a <NUM> sq . ft. home , especially when it 's a standard a-frame building ( granted , it 's for a family of <NUM> , but then again there 's nothing `` green '' about having <NUM> children ) . it does cover some good stuff like gray-water use , rain collection , alternative heating and cooling , but it glosses over all of this and takes up a lot of space with strange-angled shots of rooms and floor plans . i know the floor plan i want , and there 's very little that a floor plan has to do with green building ( it 's more about orientation to the sun for passive solar use ) . what i 'd prefer to have seen was simple diagrams of how the systems of the house work . there 's a spot that explains how one house has the pool hooked up to the ac such that the hot exhaust from the ac heats the pool . now that 's something i can get into , but i want more than a couple sentences about it . that deserves a diagram
this movie was pretty awful . since i am ranking it with <NUM> star , then according to another reviewer i must not have a soul . hey , it does n't feel bad ! this movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie i have ever seen , particularly in a sci-fi movie . it is worse than the blaxploitation films of the <NUM> 's , which were at least entertaining . this movie is about a group of teenage white kids , with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it . `` but just how 'black ' is he ? , '' you may be wondering . well the movie makes it clear that he 's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts : <NUM> . he talks different from the whites . ( `` hey bodee . '' `` his name 's bodhi ! '' `` well you say it your way , and i 'll say it mine . '' or something to that effect . ) <NUM> . he breakdances . ( and we all know that all black people can breakdance , ca n't they ? ) <NUM> . he likes basketball . ( again , every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it , right ? ) <NUM> . he raps . ( because a person is n't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop , can they ? ) i 'm a white guy . and i 'm not overly sensitive to racism issues . but watching this movie really surprised me . i was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype . i ca n't say that it 's a good thing . it is quite embarassing to watch , actually . what where they thinking ? this movie would never have been made that way in today 's day and age . the movie itself is pretty lame . it was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the <NUM> 's . it has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days . it also features a funky little ball named bodhi . it is the weirdest , most nonsensical story i have ever watched . it is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up , which was later worked into a screenplay . this movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch . the only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as jason patric ( the lost boys ) and jami gertz ( the lost boys , twister , still standing ) . it is also nice to see richard jordan ( logan 's run ) , as well as the stunning sarah douglas ( superman ii , conan the destroyer ) starring in a villainess roll , as usual . sarah douglas really does make a good villain , too . it 's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie . `` sphere of longiness '' ? ech ! i do n't understand all you people who are giving this movie <NUM> stars . i mean , what are you thinking ? it has to be just the `` i love the <NUM> 's '' nostalgia-factor kicking in . i do n't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon . and please . skating on an overgrown road ? skating in the dirt ? they 'd get about <NUM> feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying . it might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand . i 'd have to say , that other dystopian future skating flick , `` prayer of the rollerboys '' is a much better movie than this . of course that ai n't saying much , because that movie pretty much stinks too . buy something else . anything else . if not for yourself , then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect
the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again . i was disappointed , soon after , when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts , with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing . i mean graceland for a first date ? i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights , and logan and nate from that same book . none of them can talk in complete sentences . and stella , who comes across as this loving mother , who puts her kids before anything else , works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she is n't there to oversee everything , even though the place has been successful for years . there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband , she just does it . unless , of course , it was in the last <NUM> pages which i did n't bother to read because i just could n't torture myself any longer . and i 'm a big fan of roberts . i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work . but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be . i 'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out .
lets get <NUM> fact out : iron maiden doesnt care anymore ! ! ! how can they be so brilliant with # of the beast , piece of mind & powerslave & then put out <NUM> terrible records in a row starting with x-factor ? this record is soooo boring ! i bought it based on wickerman which i found to be ok , reminiscent of the old iron maiden & then they just ran completely out of material . track <NUM> on sounds exactly the same , long boring slow tunes that never end .. going track after track , album after album . does `` dream of mirrors '' ever end ? i cant ever tell .. i just lose my attention due to its such a gd drag . then they hit me with `` thin line '' which is even less interesting than the most boring professor i had in the most boring class in my entire college career . you cant listen to the original `` iron maiden '' release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it , unless you just dont care . obviously they dont care ! ! this record is terrible ! if they did care they would relisten to the first <NUM> or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end iron maiden & come out with a new band named `` too old , too tired ! '' & quit defiling the great name of `` iron maiden ''
after reading this book , i caught a duck to use on the links . despite naming it ping , my distance and putting went down the toilet . i would not suggest using ping for your average hacker
this has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised . the author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory , the book will say that it does not happen this way . the author seems to wax poetic , however , he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems , for example , i defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under iupac rules . all you want is a simple list , for example , <NUM> ) find the longest chain of carbons , <NUM> ) ......... instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life . another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter , but no answers in the back . if you want the answers , you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual . my condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by the publisher , the only advice i can give is that you purchase the solutions manual , because this gives some very detailed explanations . good luck , because you will need it
i will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers , this is not a developer book , by far . it also has a lot of repetition in it . you can explain the different security groups twice , but <NUM> times seems like a little too much ... the fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me , because that is what i am looking for in a book . how to use sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
along with the nanny , the stepdad , the cable guy , the 14-year-old girl with a crush ... we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes , everyone is out to get us .. or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe . i am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality . no wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion , mistrust , fear ( and the resulting isolation ) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us . yes , films like these have their place . however , i think hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality .
i 've been a bone fan for <NUM> years and bizzy 's first <NUM> solos are classics in my opinion . however , all of the fears that speaking in tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release . i still think that bizzy 's a uniquely talented and spiritual man , but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations . the repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing
i really like wesley snipes and i really like action movies . this movie disappointed on both accounts . i had to wonder what snipes was thinking in doing this film . i still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters , so why do a straight-to-video movie . truthfully i did n't even read the cover before renting it because it was wesley snipes but even if i did i would have still rented it . the movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist , which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase . after that , the movie seems to fizzle out . there is not much dialogue and i think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film . the acting is pretty bad all around , although i think snipes did what he could with what he as given . the directing is frazzled and just plain weird . i did n't like it much at all . i think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse . given the right attention , this movie could have been great but i get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could . it has potential , but in my opinion , everyone involved in it just fell flat . i had trouble getting through the whole thing . if you are a die hard snipes fan then you might want to rent it , but i do n't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not . it just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious i have ever seen . do n't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you 've wasted your time watching it . only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are
back in his day heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys . unfortunately , that day is long past , and heinlein has wandered far from his strength . this book fills in some gaps from time enough for love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint . as was the case in time enough for love , sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme . examples : the two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages <NUM> and <NUM> and with men <NUM> times their age . the male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister , then a young teen , and he , at this point , the oldest man in human history . to make all this go down easier , the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued , and said to be 'tripped ' if she has her way with him . there is a lot more of this 'weird sex ' , but i will move on . this is not really a science fiction story per se , but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story . most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid america . there is n't really a plot . the book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine , seemingly heinlein 's feminine ideal . it is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career . this book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author .
for the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars . i cringe whenever i see god 's word taken out of context , changed , perverted , detracted from , or added onto , especially by men who are supposed to know better . in god 's word he clearly gives his opinion on fictionalizing his holy book : revelation 22:18-19 `` for i testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book : if anyone adds to these things , god will add to him the plagues that are written in this book ; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , god shall take away his part from book of life , from the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book . '' proverbs <NUM> ) :5-6 `` every word of god is pure ; he is a shield to those who put their trust in him . do not add to his words , lest he rebuke you , and you be found a liar . '' one way to be found a liar and receive god 's rebuke is by fictionalizing ( a dangerous form of adding onto god 's word where he has not made us privy to his details and outcome of events ) his words and prophecies . fictionalizing the very last days before the lord 's return not wise , and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one 's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts -- especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it . the authors of this series are treading on thin ice , simply shown by god 's own words of warning in his book . the authors have taken serious license in adding onto god 's words in their left behind series , creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture . there are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series , even among its `` christian '' characters , which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where god stands on these issues in his unchanging word . there are false representations of the mark of the beast that can not be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it . the books also have a huge misrepresentation of the antichrist . he is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be . at best , this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history jesus said would be the worst ever . the authors have gone far beyond author 's license . we just are not allowed to do this with the word of god . i urge christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the lord promised you would be for reading the book of revelation . `` blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written in it ; for the time is near . '' revelation 1:3 he has told us what he wants us to know . we do n't have the liberty to add onto it or change it
i bought this album due to the song `` soak up the sun '' . i was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd . i still believe sheryle crow keeps it real ( just not on this album )
while conway 's idea may have been in the right place , she unfortunatly did not do the required research . i am `` norse wiccan '' but luckily i did not base my tradition on this book ! ( i was forwarned before doing so ! ) for those interested in building a wiccan tradition that is norse or germanic based i suggest the following books : <NUM> ) wiccan : beliefs and practices by gary cantrell - not norse , but a very good wicca <NUM> book to serve as a blueprint . <NUM> ) witchdom of the true by edred - shows how gardnerian wicca has its roots in traditional old english `` wiccecraeft '' and the cults of the vanir from scandinavia who worshiped the `` lord and lady '' ( freyr and freyja ) as there primary deities . you have to read this book ! ! ! it 's availible from runa raven press : http : //www.runaraven.com/ <NUM> ) hammer of the gods by swain wodening - this is a book anglo-saxon heathenism , but if read the above book , you see why it is nessesary . <NUM> ) germanic heathenry : a pratical guide by james hjuka coulter - this is the ultimate book on germanic paganism . a must read ! <NUM> ) northern mysteries & magick by freya aswynn - aswynn is asatru but with a wiccan past , so her stuff tends to be more on the `` vanic '' side . worth a read . using the above books , one can build a `` norse wiccan '' tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of norse/germanic paganism , instead of the `` fluffy bunny '' and `` new age '' stuff that conway does with this book , which is basically a reprint of her celtic magic book with the names changed to norse gods and goddesses
bad plot , bad acting , bad filming . the surprise ending was a surprise because i had nearly terminated this boring , stupid film long before . the actress playing the little girl was especially poor
i am sorry but i was unable to watch this product as it is not for australian viewing which i did not realise or understand at the time . i have received a full refund for these goods but i would have rather been able to watch them . thank you for your help and i wish i could have done your review - iren
reason to believe has got to be the worst movie i have ever sat through . non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting . i am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay . there really is no reason to see this movie . totally disgusting . why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension ! ! !
this book is an awesome reference tool . it arrived in perfect condition !
there 's not too much i can offer here , since i found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie . a lot of nice shots of the robots in this , and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings . i 'm sure there has been some debate over the use of sir laurence olivier in this movie , but that 's not something that i think really applies to my overall sense of the film . i am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema . a lot of the camera angles , costumes , the shapes of the robots and weapons , all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore , and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction , as silly as they may look to us today . but this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane . there are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future , and because of that they 're not often harked upon . instead , this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments , a spiffy sidekick , and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating . this movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance .
we all know repbulicans do n't care much for the environment , and now we 're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son 's ambition is paid for with american lives . why was this book written ? are trhe bush-kochs suddenly strapped for cash ? the book , if you can focus on a father and daughter that are n't dripping with wealth and power , is good enough . i like ghwb , voted for him , but the lovefest is going way overboard . and as for the $ <NUM> billion dollar aircraft carrier ( the tenth and final nimitz-class supercarrier ) just commisioned and named after george , sr -- -it was absolutely wrong to do so . the man cvn-77 should have been named after is admiral james b. stockdale . admiral stockdale , a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor , flew over <NUM> carrier-based missions , earned <NUM> combat decorations , and after being shot down over north vietnam in <NUM> , spent <NUM> years as a p.o.w. , <NUM> years in leg irons , <NUM> years in complete darkness , tortured and beaten daily . it is amazing that he did n't go blind after <NUM> years in darkness , malnourished and sleeping on concrete . despite all of his pain , his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care . stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment . at one point , he knew that one of his fellow p.o.w.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner 's execution . his captors knew stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was , and tortured stockdale without mercy . knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner 's name , stockdale attempted suicide . rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him , he tried to take his own life . stockdale 's suicide attempt was unsuccessful , yet in the attempt , was the ultimate statement about admiral james b. stockdale , that he would rather have died than see a fellow american soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors . that maybe true about ghwb , but perhaps not so about our current president . adwarded the congressional medal of honor in <NUM> , admiral stockdale died in july of <NUM> . even ghwb would tell you that cvn-77 should have been named after admiral stockdale . why is n't that in your book , doro ? on october 7th , <NUM> days after your book was released , you christened the uss george h.w . bush , cvn-77 . it rained that day . so much so that the ceremony was closed to the public
well here we go again . i tried to watch this movie with an open mind and i just could not stand it . here we have another movie with ms. whurer and it is just like most of her movies very very poorly acted and just a waste of time and film for that matter . if all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you . if you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than i sugest that you do n't waste your time and money . i guess when they cast for an actress here all they were looking for was how well she looks with no clothing on and did not pay attention to the simple fact that this woman has no talent
the world adventure teams dora with swiper -- that 's right , as friends . their mission is to save `` friendship day '' by replacing the bracelets that swiper had swiped . it is really sad that on a trip around the world they did n't visit any country where spanish is spoken . and what 's more , the plot is really boring . nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid . the songs that swiper and dora sing together are lousy . nothing about the songs is catchy or fun . another odd thing is that dora 's voice is different . it sounds like they could n't get the same actress they normally use to do dora 's voice . dora sounds older . there are a lot of fun dora videos out there but this is n't one of them
so i finally got around to watching `` michael moore hates america '' , the dvd that was financed by richard mellon scaife , with the help of a few right-wing think tanks . also appearing is penn jillette , a rabid psychiatrist , some nra staffers , pundits , more think-tankers , and a number of pissed-off vets . while wilson comes off as tolerant ( backhandedly ) with regards to moore 's techniques , when it comes to his ideas it 's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man 's social commentary . there 's a lot of well-balanced , average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess , but the number of instances that hint that maybe , just maybe moore 's got a few points in his films ( as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context ) are exceedingly few . center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation , so the movie caters to them very well . by far most of the examples criticized here involve bowling for columbine , with only a few from `` roger and me '' and none from `` fahrenheit <NUM> '' although the movie was released . in one scene wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw `` fahrenheit '' the day before : `` how would knowing that mr. moore 's selective editing of the facts in fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film ? '' on a social level , the film is a veritable ode to republican framing , i.e . : there is no economic divide , corporations do n't hurt us , we can all be successful if we work hard enough , criticizing the leadership means you hate america , etc. , etc ... and oh yeah , one actually guy goes on to say that we do n't need michael moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media , amazingly lumping present-day fox , cnn and pre-merger cbs-era walter cronkite together in the same sentence . ultimately , the man ( michael wilson ) fails to get his interview .
for $ <NUM> i guess its fine , but i did n't learn anything from this book at all . if anything , i actually feel more alienated . i do not live in the gay neighborhood of my city nor do i hang out exclusively with gay people . however , coexisting with straight people is n't even a passing thought in this book . basically , if you do n't live as a cher-worshipping rainbow flag waving poster child of gaydom , the book paints you as a maladjusted closet case who should be avoided at all costs . i agree with the review that said this is a good guide to turning into a `` flaky queen '' . also , i can not even count the number of times alcohol is referred to in this book ( and i rarely drink ) but any drug use is met with a `` kick him to the curb , girlfriend '' attitude ( i do n't do drugs either , but i 'm just pointing it out ) . the book does not answer any central questions about what men want . there is research out there about how important a good body * really * is and how important masculine traits really are for a relationship vs. hookup . this author did not pull any of that in . however , there is an underlying assumption that all gay men go to the gym , and usually that is an all-gay gym ( so i guess a good body is really important to him ... ) . as far as the authors take on the value that gay men place on education or personal growth - oh wait - neither topic is ever mentioned . the whole book can be summed up with the fact that the author actually gives advice on `` what to say if he catches you looking at his streisand cds when he comes out of the bathroom '' . so , essentially , the book is a disappointing series of common-sense superficial tips that anyone who went to high school already knows : `` do n't seem needy or desperate , be confident , do n't go into your whole life story on the first date . '' i mean , if you 're that clueless about dating ... then go for it . maybe i would 've found this useful at <NUM> or <NUM> , however . ( oh , by the way i just learned that being <NUM> is old . it 's mentioned about <NUM> times . ) i also like how there is a whole chapter devoted to what you should hide & display in your bathroom ( aveda = bad ... generic shaving cream = good ) . um , by the time a guy is in my bathroom , he is probably on his way to having sex with me so i think it 'll just have to be ok if he sees moisturizer with retinol . if he wants to end the relationship over my brand of shaving cream ( yes , that is mentioned as well ) then i 'm done too . what is amazing is that in previous chapters , `` being your fabulous gay self '' is encouraged , but now we 're playing `` hide the gay cosmetics ? '' the book is replete with hypocritical counsel , vague generalizations , and inconsistencies . i suppose , then , it is more of a metaphor of gay dating than a guide to it .
for as long as i can remember i have been a fan of krs-one/b.d.p . and i have to say that this is the worst album i have heard by him . sound wise most of these tracks sound pretty commercial and could easily be heard on the radio . lyrically the `` teacher '' that we all know and love has fallen off to a point that he may never be able to recover i mean the lyrics are downright terrible . this is a sad day for hip hop fans every where . their is not a single song on this album that is even close to enjoyable . lets hope that in the futre krs can get it together and release another banger . but for now i think ill stick with sneak attack the last truly great lyrical album
not sure what i was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes , would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one
for some reason , i fell into the trap of believing a dvd that consists of all of eminem 's music videos would be really cool . it really is n't . in fact , i have only watched this dvd once . the music videos are great , but how many times do you really think you are going to watch them . the extras are definetely not worth the purchase . once again , how many times are you going to watch the making of stan . the extra that mocks the blair witch project is also just really really bad . overall , do n't buy this . download the music videos and spend your money elsewhere . actually , go use it to see <NUM> mile
i ca n't imagine why mr. andriessen 's new opera writing to vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe `` you had to be there . '' on cd , however , it 's a grating , annoying , and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure ... in fact , i finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc . life is too short , after all .
not a huge fan of james cagney or gangster movies , and nothing about white heat has changed that opinion . lame plot , corny dialogue , and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing . in it 's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades . hardly what i would consider to be a classic
this album is , as has been mentioned before , a followup to rice 's o -- which in my estimation was an amazing cd that warranted listening to over and over again , adding to ipod playlists , creating cd 's for my wife and just generally enjoying . creative lyrics , although sometimes inscrutable ( blower 's daughter , one of my favorite songs , but what the heck is he talking about ? ! ) , made o never get old . <NUM> really misses the mark . it sounds like damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw ( affair , lack of passion , confusion , bitterness ? ) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of damien for me to relate to . witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'rootless tree ' : so * * * * you , * * * * you , * * * * you and all you did n't do i said leave it , leave it , leave it it 's nothing to you and do you hate me , hate me , hate me , hate me so much that you ca n't let me out , let me out , let me out of hell when you 're around let me out , let me out , let me out hell when you 're around let me out , let me out , let me out ok then . then there is 'me , my yoke and i ' : my fall , my fall my fall gon na break ya my fall , my fall my fall gon na break your wall i 'm in , i 'm in , i 'm in like a big dog i 'm in , i 'm in , i 'm in like a big dog yeah my god , my god , my god gave me a rod my god , my god , my god gave me a rod for fishin , fishin , fishin fishin , fishin , fishin yeah starting to get the idea ? this is a self absorbed ( more than usual ) album that an angst filled `` alone in my teenage bedroom '' songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world . oh , and 'sleep do n't weep ' ends with like <NUM> minutes of a tibetan bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull . was rice just trying to see how much his listener 's would put up with ? having said all that , lisa hannigan shines once more in ' <NUM> crimes ' and damien complements her very well , and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy , but overall i must say that the `` emperor has no clothes '' , even if others are afraid to say it
the dvd was okay and i needed it for a gift ( which i was late for - my fault ) . i received it in <NUM> days but it arrived totally smashed . it was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing . the outside of the package was marred but not ripped open . but when i opened it i was horrified that the entire case was crushed . i delicately took it apart and it seemed that the dvd was untouched so i put it in another generic case that i had around the house . that was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and i could n't fit it in my case . because i was late with my gift , i did n't have time to send it back to you . the price was right , the service was quick , just bulk up on your shipping a little
i am a big leslie nielsen fan . i first saw him in the naked gun series , which i thought was awesome , then i saw him again in wrongfully accused . i was so enthralled that i acquired airplane , which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it . i had thought he could do no wrong , but he really disappointed me here . what is wrong with this movie ? everything you will see in here are things you have already seen in other leslie nielsen comedy movies . there are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it 's painful rather than funny . for example , the x-ray glasses . my god , when that was mentioned , i just felt nauseous . the problem with this movie is that it continues the naked gun-variety humor , but it does it rather badly . most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring . aside from that , this movie lacks a proper plot . all throughout the movie , it does n't seem like dick steele ( nielsen ) did anything , but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag . nielsen 's other movies had bad plots too , but at least they were coherent . i am sorry ( mostly to myself for seeing this ) , but this was just a bad movie . perhaps the director should go watch the entire naked gun series to see how it is done
passport video , a north hollywood , ca , outfit , in their search for quality , match that other outfit , alpha video , for getting their hands on old , beat-up , third or fourth generation 8mm prints of films . the sound track is fixed , but the picture is dreadful , not remastered or brought up to date at all , which , with our technical equipment is possible ! they have simply put these very old junk prints on dvd . the price is high for this mess . there ought to be a law against putting out this kind of quality on dvd , i wo n't put the word for it here -- i 'll leave that to george carlin -- but ! do n't buy it
this movie is basically about <NUM> yr. old boys crying with each other . when does that ever happen ? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids . what <NUM> yr. old worries about `` .. never getting out of this small town. '' ? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends , then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense . i have a feeling oprah would like this movie .
in a very convoluted plot , harvard professor robert langdon ( tom hanks ) and cryptologist sophie neveu ( audrey tautou ) are chased through the streets of paris and london by the french police and a crazed religious fanatic named silas . it 's your typical hollywood action-thriller in most respects . yes , it 's silly and unrealistic . but if that 's all there were to it i might go along with the `` it 's only a movie '' argument . unfortunately , this movie is also full of ideas , ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts . as an atheist , i certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in christian history . for example , the inquisition , the witch burnings and the crusades are all mentioned . yet these actual historical events are only brushed over . instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the catholic church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about christianity . for example , it states that not only were jesus and mary magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day . they also portray a secret catholic society that is involved in murder plots , strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities . it 's completely fair to challenge the church on its grave errors . for example , the shameful inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people . i also disagree with the vatican 's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control . however , the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-catholic bigotry . it 's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against jews to justify brutal acts of anti-semitism , including the holocaust . no , i do n't think it 's likely that the `` da vinci code '' will lead to the mass execution of catholics . but any time a particular group is scapegoated it 's a potential source of trouble . basically , `` the da vinci code '' is a bunch of mumbo jumbo , distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence . but , unfortunately , as p.t . barnum said , `` there 's a sucker born every minute , '' and some people are going to believe this nonsense . history is a complex subject and i have no respect for people , whether they be the book 's writer , dan brown , or the film 's director , ron howard , who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck . this is garbage . do n't waste your time
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series . years later i read s is for silence and was hooked . i started to read the series -- backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning . i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh <NUM> lbs on her <NUM> ' <NUM> '' frame ) . however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best . you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions -- -belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few . the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics . but even with these issues , i did finish the book . grafton at her low point is still a good read
i bought this dvd based on the excellent reviews . as both an afficionado , and practitioner of kink , i am always looking for a good film in that genre . not only is `` maitresse '' poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable . i also found the film `` quality '' leaving a lot to be desired . ( poor lighting ) i found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it . the relationship and communication between the domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling , and left me with the impression that i had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other . there was just no chemistry between the players . save your money
boy , i hate to point out a negative here , but to say that fundamentalism is a way of holding a belief and not about content is historically ill informed . fundamentalism began as a reaction against denominational seminaries adopting theological views that were viewed as against scripture in their content . here are a few of those issues . you tell me if you think they are content or ways of holding it : jesus was not born of a virgin . many of the miracles of jesus were fictional . jesus did not necesarily raise from the dead . most of the more outrageous old testament stories were not to be taken as historically accurate . i could go on . has he not read what really happened historically to create that movement ? ? ? big mistake , or real dishonest ! even now rollins goes about building what they reacted against . rollins says he will not be undermining chrisitan content , but he is opening the door for those who will . in fact , for him to make the following statement about life after death makes me wonder if he really cares about truth or his post modern posture . `` death is a term that refers to the end of all experience . regardless of what , if anything , happens after this event , ... '' page <NUM> he strives to make his own point at the expense of christian truth . fundamentalism , even today , in it 's popularly decried `` no fun , too much dam , and not enough mental '' caricature is really primarily about content and only secondarily about how they hold their views . it was born in a fight and rollins wants to take us back into the fight . evangelicalism is the answer as to content and holding it rightly , but rollins really does not believe in answers .
i am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man . however , when i first came across this book a few years ago , i was offended and frankly , shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book . whoever the author may be , s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is not to insult black men , who represent her brothers , her father or her friends . another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth , when it stated that historically , it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [ ... ] , and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her . half of me believes [ or wants to believe ] that this book is actually a satire . i hope one day to have my hopes confirmed !
you know this guy did appeal to me at first , but if you have this cd youve heard american bad ass , right ? listen to metallicas & quot ; sad but true & quot ; . he ripped off the guitar part completely . h e tries to be metal , hardcore rap , and country at the same time . fails miserably . he is a talentless wigger . wait ... thats too nice . i hope he commits suicide
okay , maybe i am the odd ball , but this author drove me crazy ! he should have made a pamplet instead of a book . i felt as though it was written by a amway sales person . to me , the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house . i needed factual information , and i got <NUM> % & quot ; you can do it & quot ; and <NUM> % & quot ; this is the stuff you need & quot ; . if you are two years away from building , you might like it , but i was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided . i am sending mine back
if you were waiting for ministry of sound to ruin hed kandi well then here it is . thankfully i have n't brought this . after hearing this compilation it is very clear that hed kandi is over . the only cd that 's any good is the 3rd one and that 's cause it 's full of hed kandi classic 's which i 've already herd a million times .... do n't waste your money . if you 've already brought any ministry of sound cd 's this year then do n't bother cause if you have n't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this . reserve your listening time for something worth while . quality is n't a word i 'd use to discribe this compilation at all ..
in it 's prime this was probably a great opera and if you are interested in the early culture of our country it is a must see . the opera is difficult to follow and a guide would be helpful otherwise you just stumble through it . not much for entertainment .
a best of white lion album ? what are they selling blank cds ? seriously , the <NUM> 's had great bands , but towards the end things were getting a little ridiculous . the final nail in the coffin for <NUM> 's rock was white lion and warrant . nuff said
to begin , i am not a big fan of cary grant , except in his hitchcock movies , where he was excellent . and i enjoy him much with katharine hepburn in bringing up baby . he was very good in the eagle and the hawk with fredric march . he was tolerable in the philadelphia story and talk of the town . a friend of mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i had wanted to see what cary would do in this film , and i wanted to see him in the dress . from the start , the movie was slow and boring , all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny . i also do n't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other , and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other . come on ! i just ca n't understand that sort of romance situation . i felt cary showed that `` mean streak '' he can show in some of his films , in the romance situation of this story . i rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end . all the while i kept saying , `` let 's move along , let 's end this thing , when does he put on the dress ? ... '' but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring , corny jokes . and the part we wanted to see , cary in the dress , was at the very end and not very much at that . overall , this film was a real disappointment and letdown . the only consolation was that i saw it for free ; i did n't have to buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time that i could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way . i would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! to sum it up , a very very boring and dumb movie , not to waste your time on .
huh ? what happened to the ingested fig ? to the excrement in the park ? to the severed thumb buried in the floor ? yes these are major fuel sources that ( up to a point ) propel the plot forward . what happens , even in the broadest of terms , to the characters ? to wally for instance ? atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending . for amazon to sell this book with ( and by implication to compare it to ) the exquisite `` shadow of the wind '' shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books ( set in 20th century europe seems the only obvious similarity ) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one
the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times . so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant . what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy . there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo ( apparently supernatural ? ) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as `` do you believe in ghosts ? '' the `` lighter '' scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling . admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in 3d . yet `` the polar express '' still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children .
i began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating . as a lawyer handling divorce and family cases , i frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and i was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations . however , this book was incredibly basic , and i 'm not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious . there are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique
my least favorite simon album . the writing is forced and inconsistent . not very good
imagine no possessions ? fine , then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces . imagine no religion ? fine , if religion 's such a `` crutch '' , then you forsake your million dollar drug habit . imagine no countries ? fine , then you move from england or america to africa or el salvador . the world will be as one ? fine , then you act like an adult and do n't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most . john lennon was a text book phony . he was a grown-up with a child 's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he would n't . maybe if he did n't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded ..... then and now . the utopian dreams of the <NUM> 's are history , and they were destroyed by none other than lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation . his blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn . thank you very much . -dw .
i found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation ( how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives ? ) and one-sided 'analysis ' . it is clear the bin ladin was 'lost ' at tora bora when our troops were called back to garrison , allowing him to escape . this goes even farther to the right than micheal moore goes to the left . if you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several administrations , read `` against all enemies : inside america 's war on terror '' by richard clarke . if you buy this book , you are paying for propaganda
several of the disks had physical defects which ruined the experience . i requested a replacement and received a refund . who 's stearing the ship ?
boring , outdated ex-patriate story of life in paris between the wars , focusing on a young american actress , a psychologist dr. diver and his wife , an american baroness with issues . lots of drinking and gossip
is this for real ? it sounds like john tesh or harry connick jr . i just got this cd and it put me to sleep . it should be called destination down the tube.i 'm a diehard bon jovi fan from new jersey and i can not believe he released this tragedy.i love all the cd 's from bon jovi but this solo by jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.and for richie , bryan and tico , please do n't let jon out of your sight again
i found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories . the dates and names are wrong .. needless to say i was dissapointed
so , when did maya angelou received the nobel prize for literature ? pg.12
i made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils . if you can buy the karaoke version , this might be pretty good , otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest yanni cd . the vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame
this is largely the same team of letters who do the majority of lettering for image comics , and maybe one day when they decite to do it for a more professional comics company , then they can write a book like this , until then , no sale
i am so happy you sent me this e-mail . i purchased this cd for my brother for christmas and you sent me the wrong cd - i received something called whoracle by in flames which is not what i ordered and i am really disappointed and i would really like it if you would send me what i ordered , which is the jimmy buffett cd - the ultimate collection ......... please get back to me . thank you , rosane cassell
okay let me get this straight . if i wear dreadlocks , throwback sports apparel , big sunglasses , put some radiators in my mouth , act drunk , and scream lame unintelligible raps i too can be a big star ? alas , there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof . scuse me whilst i look for a bridge to leap from
this might be a `` great '' cd to some people , and it might be good in your eyes , but it is blasphemy to good music . why do n't you guys try bands like black flag , the sex pistols , the misfits , maybe even my personal favorite <NUM> 's grunge , i.e . nirvana . fall out is so whiny , i 'd like to give a thumbs down , for the future of good music do n't buy this cd
stultifyingly written . no one without at least an undergraduate major in philosophy will get much out of it . i recommend that all tempted to read this should first read the kirkham book `` theories of truth ''
abc dives into the kennedy killing with this video showing how the lone-nut oswald did the killing alone , just as the warren commission said he did . the main focus of the video seems to be to show why all of the conspiracy-theory people are mistaken and misled . unfortunately , the content is sufficiently weak that the video 's ability to persuade will be limited to those who are completely unfamiliar with the facts . it 's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like : <NUM> ) the parkland hospital doctors in the er who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of kennedy 's neck , an exit wound on the back of his head , and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of kennedy 's head seen on the zapruder film , <NUM> ) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of kennedy 's wounds , <NUM> ) the second bullet fired by lone-nut oswald passed through kennedy 's body , through connally 's body , and lodged in connally 's leg , later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the warren commission , <NUM> ) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard , hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll , and seeing the limousine momentarily stop , <NUM> ) oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in <NUM> seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots , <NUM> ) oswald decided not to fire when the kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him , had traveled several hundred yards , and was moving away , <NUM> ) oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in <NUM> seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots , <NUM> ) fire a bolt-action rifle <NUM> times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin ' test given hours later by the dallas pd , and <NUM> ) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting , when the president came driving by . if none of these things are a stretch , then you will find abc 's work highly persuasive . otherwise , you will start to wonder why abc is cranking out this kind of stuff and ... perhaps ... even become a conspiracy nut . even if you do lean towards the conspiracy point of view , though , you will find this video well-produced and interesting .
turns out i purchased this cd for one song . i was very disappointed with the rest of the cd . the song at last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd
i am not surprised nugent does n't mention what he once claimed was his favorite teenaged pastime , `` nunning . '' in an interview for `` oui '' magazine in the early <NUM> 's , nugent was all too ready and willing to explain to the interviewer just what this `` nunning '' was . as nugent explained it : he and a friend would drive around churches , convents , catholic schools etc . with whichever one of them was on the passenger side having a large street map laid out on their lap . underneath the map , nugent and pal would have his zipper undone and his penis hanging out . when they would spot a young nun who looked naive enough , they would ask her through the halfway opened car window for directions to a certain street or road . as she would walk over , the jerk with the map would playact at being confused , looking dumbfounded at it . when the poor sister would reach into the car so she can get a better look at what nugent and friend were having trouble , nugent or friend would then quickly roll up the window thus trapping the now terrified nun . then nugent or friend would toss away the map waving their penis in the poor nun 's face and fondle her chest . this is the guy who has so much to say about morals , ethic and right living . this guy is a degenrate and his conservative republican friends are all hypocrites when they have so much to say about `` liberal celebrities '' and never even acknowledge what this guy was so proud to brag about back in the <NUM> 's
a terrible , terrible waste of money . all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head paul godfrey is . face it : no one gives a sh @ t about morcheeba anymore , we 're not interested in who 'inspired ' them , ( poor annette peacock - has anyone told her ? ) . the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age-old question : & quot ; paper or plastic ? & quot
this guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers . olp have no business working with him and the result shows . olp is way out of ballards league and i have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music . perhaps olp wanted to have a sell-out sound , otherwise this disc is a disaster . somewhere out there is pure disposable pop . none of this material would be on `` happiness '' or `` spiritual machines '' how can you go from a concept album from a ray kurzveil book to a horrible glen ballard . over produced , pop record
this book promised the world , the author and his friends sounded reputable and knowledgable ; it was only the cover art that looked dodgy . we have often been told to not judge books by their covers , but in this instance , the cover illustration gives a good indication of the content : cheap and childish . the font is large and type set far apart , which makes the small amount of content fill the many pages . there are dozens of spelling and grammatical errors in the book , and a remarkable amount of irrelevant stories . ( matt , do you think your readers care that you just bought a new mercedes ? we do not . there is nothing in this story for me , unless you are going to teach me how to do the same thing . the story needs to have a point and some benefit to the listener or reader ! ) much of the book 's `` million dollar tips '' can be found faster and for free on the internet , just by doing a google search on `` marketing techniques '' . indeed , much of the book ( when it is not self-congratulation ) refers to websites where one can find more information . i gather that at least some of the websites may be owned by , or affiliated with , matt and his team . if this is a sales brochure for another online course , it does not advertise well or read well . look elsewhere for lessons on how to market and sell effectively
i have heard a lot about richard matheson , and when i found out he 'd written a survivalist fiction story ( a favorite sub-genre of mine ) i was elated to read it . however , after a long arduous struggle to continue reading , i realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected . `` hunted past reason '' tells the story of two men : doug and bob . bob , a writer , wants to write a novel of backpacking . doug , the expert , is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade . right from the start , we are privy to the personality clash between the two . doug starts out as a `` know it all '' to bob . he tries to bludgeon bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness . as the story progresses , we see doug 's jealousy of bob 's successful career and family life come to the surface . i must admit that the subtle changes in doug are blended very well into the story . on the other hand , the story was dragged out far too long than necessary . after philosophical discussions between the two ( which are strained at best ) , we see doug 's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two . after a graphic rape scene , doug gives bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into `` deliverance '' ( as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out ) . the writing seems to be quite repetitive . the mental conversations between bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out . being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction , i was mildly entertained by the reading , however , i expected a bit more from matheson ( simply because of his fame and influence he 's had on other writers ) . maybe i was a bit unfair , but the other reviews tell me otherwise
while not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow , this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four . yesterday is instantly forgettable , dizzy miss lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the <NUM> 's and ticket to ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly . as usual , i did enjoy ringo 's excellent drumming and i liked the song act naturally . for shame !
well i bought this book hoping that i could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and i dislike processed cereals . i am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries . all i have to say is that the recipes that i have tried taste alright but the timing is off . some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour
drivel . i 'm a <NUM> year old woman and i like `` chick flicks '' when they are good . i loved `` you 've got mail '' . but this ? this was just drivel . badly written , formulaic boring plot , and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends . you want to watch funny interactions between the sexes , watch friends or bbc 's coupling . you want to watch charisma act ? go rent buffy and angel . watch veronica mars . charisma did her best to be mary tyler moore , but in the end , she was an unbelievable character who i 'm supposed to believe as a wallflower . yeah . right
it 's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way . i ca n't play a few of the songs with my kids around . while the inappropriate songs may be catchy , it 's disappointing that they had to be so `` give it to me '' . it 's also missing the `` rap/yodeling/soul '' stuff that made me like her so much in the first album
the spiritual comments are marvellous , but the factual content is dodgy . z. seems to think that a woman will always get her period at the same phase of the moon . but the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is * shorter * than the moon 's cycle of <NUM> 1/2 days , so it wo n't stay in step . ( besides , many women 's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average . ) z. also says the earth and sun are getting closer together at the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice ; that 's actually close to aphelion . ( it 's the tilt of the earth 's axis that causes the seasons , not our distance from the sun . ) and as for astrological birth control , and garlic juice as a cure for cancer ... ! an inspiring book - but take it with a grain of salt
i had to use this particular book for a class i was taking . i was hoping for at least a balanced presentation , but i was very disappointed with this book . i found it to have a definite anti-life view . i found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics . especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics . i also found that the author tried to present catholic church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the church developed these views
since we know there is another version of `` burn '' out there , i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.you can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan , poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.brando told larry king it was his favorite film ; not if he saw this package
well , it has been more than two years now , and perfect pop album is ( somehow ) back after it 's very minor success with the first edition , and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse . first problem , hollywood records should n't be doing complications . they are disney records 's sister . i mean , look at the tracklistings . they look like another radio disney jams cd . joss stone , josh kelly , and liz phair are really the only reason buying `` got hits <NUM> '' . the rest are disney channel fillers . the cd starts with seven disney acts in a row , starting with hilary duff , the lastest flop in the music industry . depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with `` metamorphisis '' , she did n't even go gold on her self-titled second album . `` come clean '' was really the only big hit by this artist , which to me was a big shocker , `` so yesterday '' was way better . then we move to jesse mccartney , oh boy ! `` beautiful soul '' may have a good melody , but jesse 's vocals , awful . and the lyrics make no sense . `` i do n't want another pretty face , i do n't want just anyone to hold , i do n't want my love to go to waste , i want you and your beautiful soul . '' well , if you think about it , is n't that a beautiful soul ? a girl with a pretty face , and good personality ? whatever . let 's move on to jojo . okay , i do n't mind her , as long as you put something decent by her , like `` leave ( get out ) '' . instead , they put her hit `` baby it 's you '' . the song did well on the charts , and the song is decent , but i think i 've had enough . but wait , there 's four more ! lindsay lohan is next up , she did n't have many hit songs , unless you cou n't her minor `` rumors '' big . they put on `` ultimate '' . wtf ? when and where was that a hit ? or maybe i should look on foriegn charts to see why hollywood records chose this . it was on the <NUM> soundtrack `` freaky friday '' , and all of the sudden it 's big . moving on . next up is bow wow 's rival , romeo . okay , for all honesty here , how did he get a record deal ? master p 's song `` make em say ugh '' was n't bad enough ? `` my cinderella '' is just a poor quality rap song you 'd hear on radio disney . then we have skye sweetnam . now , `` tangled up in me '' is actually a decent song . it 's melody is damn catchy , and they have pretty good voices . i definitely would n't recommended their `` noise from the basement '' album . way too much filler . then we have unknown jump <NUM> . okay , do n't name the album got hits if you have an unknown artist . anyway , `` god bless the u.s.a. '' is horrible , they ca n't sng their way out of a bag . then we 're finally up with disney artists ( but their revenge comes again later in the cd ) . next , we have a country song by rascal flatts . it 's okay ; not a country fan . the album is called `` got hits <NUM> : more perfect pop '' . notice the uppercase letters . then , we have our first song worth listening to , from joss stone . though , `` some kind of wonderful '' was barely a hit , it 's still an awesome add , as the song is decent . she has a great voice and her songs are great ; jazz flavored pop songs . then we have raven-symone and the cheetah girls . i 'm not even continuing with this song , since those artists alone should spell trouble . luckily , after that , we have alternative rock queen liz phair , with her self lyriced `` extraordinary '' . the song is excellent , from the jammin ' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics , to her voice . you should definitely check out her music , especially her older stuff . two paragraphs back , i said that disney 's revenge is coming . well , the disney radio artists have returned . we have raven symone ( second time on this cd ) doing `` supernatural '' , which was probably the biggest hit in disney radio history , and is featured on `` the haunted mansion '' soundtrack . on regular top <NUM> radio , never heard it . the song is average at best , and the same rule applies . just because you have a big tv show , does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record . and the same rule applies with the next artist . once again , the second song on this cd by hilary duff , and she brings her sister into the song , which is the third disney soundtrack song . this one was featured on the `` a cinderella story '' soundtrack . okay , this remake is just horrific . first , you have the second worst vocals in the history of music ( milli vanilli being the worst ) , then you have `` our lips are sealed '' . now , the go-gos version is very good , but the lyrics do n't even fit hilary . next , we have the vengaboys . enough said . then we have some group called mr. c and the slide man . maybe i 'm not quite old enough , but who the f is this ? the song is ridiculous , and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album . then , josh kelley 's `` amazing '' is amazing , and he actually writes his music . that gave me some hope about the end of this album ... but wait ... we 're at the end . unless you 're a gigantic fan of radio disney and like <NUM> songs on a <NUM> complication , avoid this on all costs , and get now <NUM> in stores tuesday july <NUM> , <NUM> . replay value : low child appeal : high teen appeal : low adult appeal : lo
the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the <NUM> 's . it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series . it was a travesty to see optimus prime ( the greatest of the transformers ) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable of leadership . galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron -- he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic . why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie , they were forgettable . it amuses me that `` fans '' are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago . the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did . as a fan , i was insulted . perhaps these other `` fans '' have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage .
this is a review for normal people . if you are a fan of standard fiddle do not buy this cd . it is a bunch of badly recorded , half hearted , boring and sloppy songs thrown together on an overpriced cd . save yourself $ ... or if you like this type of music just go buy some old little rascals episodes on dvd . then you will get the same music you hear on this plus the bonus of the little rascals . now i know why we think of blues guitar players not fiddle players when this music is discussed . the other reviewers seem to think some of the names on this cd will be familiar to you . do n't believe them , unless names like `` abrew 's portuguese instrumental trio '' or `` dixieland jug blowers '' are familiar to you . i am just hoping to prevent normal music lovers from stepping into this pile and losing $ ... like i did . i play banjo , fiddle , mandolin , dulcimer and guitar all badly , but i could get a gig with these bands and probably improve their sound . if you are the artsy type that digs this kind of stuff and you ca n't wait to grow a goatee , turn the lights down low , fill the room with smoke ( oops , bad for your health ) , put your sunglasses on and crank this baby up ; i hope you do n't mind being stuck by yourself all the time because no one else is going to put up with this lousy music . go find something with chubby wise in it if you want to hear some real fiddle playing . help support some little known , up and coming fiddle players that need to buy food and pay rent with royalty checks by buying their music instead of making these labels , that get this junky music for free or almost free , super rich
all i have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads . it really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are . ballad -- a ballad is a story , usually a narrative or poem , in a song . any story form may be told as a ballad , such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form . it usually has foreshortened , alternating four- and three-stress lines ( 'ballad meter ' ) and simple repeating rhymes , often with a refrain . if it is based on political or religious themes , a ballad may be a hymn . it should not be confused with the ballade , a 14th and 15th century french verse form . some good examples of ballads : the devil went down to georgia , the ballad of jesse james , johnny has gone for a soldier , ode to billie joe while there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads , the large majority are not . the same goes with that monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock
i really enjoyed bear family 's robert mitchum two-fer & quot ; that man & quot ; and immediately bought this disc when i saw it . first of all , the content is lighter weight than his other albums . these tracks from his early filmwork are great for the mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man 's singing ability should be directed to & quot ; that man & quot ; or & quot ; calypso is like so & quot ; . my complaint ( and the reason i did n't give it a higher rating ) is the packaging . i thought it was beautiful when i first opened it . a shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info . then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing . then , the pages started falling out of the book ! the whole thing literally fell apart on me ! for a pricey import disc such as this , it 's totally unacceptable . maybe i just got a defective one , but i 'm not willing to plunk down another <NUM> bucks to find out . if you feel you must buy this disc , a word of caution : handle with care
i have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by dhl global mail . this is a ridiculous and unacceptable situation . i will never use amazon again , i feel cheated
brandon cruz is trying to recapture something he never had . his credibility as an artist . why else would he redo the songs written by kyle instead of writing his own ? kyle toucher was the backbone of dr. know ! i am utterly amazed at how brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.i recommend & quot ; the best of dr. know & quot ; if you want to hear these songs as they were intended
this book covers much of the same ground that clayton christensen explored in his three revolutionary books : the innovator 's dilemma , the innovator 's solution , and seeing what 's next . truthfully , those books do a far superior job of explaining the dynamics of innovation in comparison to the performance of this book . utterback does have very insightful comments on the standardization of product design , but outside of that section , the book is not particularly exemplary . for those interested in mastering the art of innovation , the game begins and ends with clayton christensen
it takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist <NUM> will go down with the virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service . and it is two completely wasted hours . hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover , the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship , the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship , the bad acting , the farcical piano duel with jelly roll morton , the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like amelia earhart confused about why she 's on a ship instead of her plane . the movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much . i watched it because of the director 's earlier cinema paradiso . he is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables .
this was assigned for summer reading in freshman yr at my college . i ca n't believe gibberish stuff like this gets published . kingston 's past accounts were boring to read about , at times confusing with all the muti-named relatives . the events were and pointless and just blah . i tried to make it to the end of the book , but sadly i did n't . it was just too boring ! i would give this less than one star if i could . do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague .
i remember when saturday night live did a spoof of irene cara from fame singing the theme song from the movie as `` same : '' `` same ! i sing the same song forever . '' maybe peter should have gone that route instead of this album . i just got through listening to it , and have decided he should never have left chicago . sure , it 's a nice , slick adult contemporary recording , but it 's also the same exact song with different lyrics eleven times in a row . sometimes he duets with two females who sound exactly alike -- crystal bernard ( hee-hee-hee , gimmie a break ! ) and ronna reeves , whose unique vocal style even manages to get the authenticity sucked out of it here . even his remake of the beautiful `` happy man '' from his chicago days is reduced to an extremely unattractive entrail of itself . so why <NUM> stars instead of one ? production quality is key here , and it 's nice wallpaper music for wallpapering by . beside that , it 's peter , and at least his voice is good . other than that , this is a lackluster piece of offal that i wasted under ten bucks on . my second and last solo cetera album , i suggest you steer clear of this album unless you find <NUM> versions of one song entertaining .
`` football digest '' once voted week four 's <NUM> monday night game between the los angeles rams and the chicago bears one of the top <NUM> monday night games ever played ( and arguably one of the greatest bears games during the post-1963 nfl championship season ) . what was even more significant than it being joe namath 's last appearance as a starter ( or the last time anyone would see broadway joe at soldier field , and no one had seen namath in chicago since the jets <NUM> win over the bears for that matter ) was the fact that chicago 's bob avellini threw <NUM> touchdown bombs in the pouring rain to beat `` hollywood joe '' ( who was knocked out of the game by bears lb waymond bryant and replaced by pat haden for the remainder of the season ) and the rams 24-23 . not only a great moment in chicago bears history , but a great moment broadcasted by abc 's legendary howard cosell . just one of the many great moments left off the `` chicago bears - the complete history '' double dvd release . what you have here is a compilation of old vhs bears highlights ( most of which were produced in the <NUM> 's by nfl films ) assembled together by the nfl network and transferred onto dvd . making it abundantly clear to real bear fans that it was n't compiled by a `` real '' bear fan . this <NUM> nfl production plays more like a propaganda film than anything else ( meaning ; this is what `` they '' want you to remember ) . a history of the chicago bears through their eyes , not bear fans . i found it rather insulting to have to listen to some spoiled brats ( virginia mccaskey ) banter concerning a game and history of a team she knows nothing about . what i mean to say is ; why could n't we get some insight from say ... chicago sun-times columnist rick telander ( someone who actually covered the bears ) than someone who sat in a luxury box and picked her nose , totally oblivious to what was happening on the field ( the dave wannstedt era of the <NUM> 's is a clear example of this ) . even more disturbing was the `` bears/packers rivalry '' segment . packer fans will find this more engaging than bear fans , considering the infamous `` asterisk '' game of <NUM> ( green bay 's 14-13 instant replay victory ) along with jim mcmahon 's <NUM> pounding into the soldier field astro turf are covered with a fair amount of detail . although ... i 'm still trying to figure out why those moments would be more memorable than chicago 's 61-7 slaughter of the bart starr coached packers of <NUM> ( which by the way was n't mentioned at all here ) . instead we 're shown ( ditka 's continuing `` fullback '' saga ) william perry 's <NUM> monday night touchdown as though that were the only memorable moment of the bear/packer rivalry concerning bear fans . i mean ... who 's highlight reel is this ? for a more comprehensive view of this rivalry , pick up gary d'amato 's `` mudbaths and bloodbaths '' book . although a bit pro-packer in places , a good read never-the-less . and after all , at this point in the dvd ... anythings better than watching green bay 's don majkowski spike the ball after scoring a td ( against the bears mind you ) , on a bears highlight film no less . the nfl network and nfl films continues with its barrage of lowlights and insults levied against bear fans by showing clips of the new york giants 47-7 mauling of the bears ( in color mind you ) in the <NUM> nfl championship , but failing to show any highlights from the famous snow bowl of <NUM> . this was an important game to the bears and their fans . it marked chicago 's return to the post-season for the first time since <NUM> . i can still hear vin scully 's `` watch fencik lower the boom '' on new york 's jimmy robinson in one of the most devastating hits in the history of the game itself . chicago won the game 12-9 ( a classic nail biter ) in the last frantic seconds of ot to capture their sixth game in a row and finish the season at 9-5 enroute to the playoffs . but we 're shown none of this . instead we 're told how great frank gifford was before , during , and after a few clips of the <NUM> nfl championship victory over the giants . again ... who 's highlight reel is this ? also , there was no mention at all of the bears week nine game of <NUM> ( the game that started the <NUM> game win streak ) against the marv levy coached kansas city chiefs ( bob avellini 's td pass to greg latta as time expired to steal a 28-27 victory in the wake of another brilliant performance by walter payton ) or the <NUM> demolishing of the st.louis cardinals 42-6 , to finish the season at 10-6 and secure a playoff birth ( the day after `` mugs '' halas ' death , and yet again ... nfl films failed to mention any of it ) . and although it was humorous to see abe gibron 's `` wired for sound segment '' , lets not forget ... he never coached a winning team in chicago . watching gibron just reminded me of all those losing seasons after the <NUM> ' nfl championship . and considering the absolute chaotic , mind-numbing bewilderment on the sidelines , it 's a miracle the bears won any games at all under gibron 's baffling direction . the only memorable gibron moment would have to be <NUM> 's monday night win over the vikings at soldier field ( the game in which abe got carried off the field , ... a huge achievement considering the fact that the bears hardly ever beat the vikings during the late <NUM> 's & early to mid <NUM> 's , and well ... taking into consideration that it was a nationally televised game and gibron 's weight ( lbs ) ... it was probably the most work the players did all year ) . but even more poignant than that for bear fans was the priceless blank look on gibron 's face , captured by the cbs camera crew during the last home game of the <NUM> season . in the midst of a <NUM> game losing streak , a mere 18,000 fans showed up in the rain and sleet to watch the bears mirro roder split the uprights in the closing seconds to clip the giants 16-13 ( known as the `` fight inflation or conserve energy ; stay home and watch bears lose '' game ... only they won ! ) . but again ... we 're shown none of this . casual bear fans will find this insightful and entertaining i 'm sure . but real bear fans will find this to be nothing more than an overpriced cheap vhs transfer of the same recycled file footage nfl films delivers whenever a chicago bears documentary is in order . ... hardly a complete history . olofpalme6
i really had little idea the cinematic pain train i was boarding as i watched rats - night of terror ( <NUM> ) aka rats - notte di terrore last night . oh sure , i read the reviews and what not , but to really get a true understanding of the film 's utterly rotten essence , you must watch it , and experience it , for yourself . i 've seen a hell of a lot of bad movies in my time , but i have to say , this fetid , moldering bit if italian produced flotsam buried the needle on my suck-o-meter , something that has n't happened since i watched red serpent ( <NUM> ) , with michael parÈ and roy scheider . written and directed by bruno mattei , the man who gave us such wonders as s.s. extermination love camp ( <NUM> ) and the ode to the usage of stock footage hell of the living dead ( <NUM> ) , the film features ottaviano dell'acqua ( zombi <NUM> ) , geretta geretta ( demons ) , massimo vanni ( escape from the bronx ) , ann-gisel glass ( deadly eyes ) , henry luciani , and fausto lombardi ( do n't look in the attic ) . the film started off well enough , with some displayed text telling us about how a great , nuclear holocaust drove those humans left alive under the ground , where they developed sophisticated societies . after some years , some ( fool ) hearty individuals decided on returning to the surface , to enjoy the toxic wonderment i suppose , and became viewed as primitives by those who remained down below . the story picks up in the year <NUM> a.b . ( after the bomb ) as we see a motorcycle gang tooling around the wasteland ( looks like an old rock quarry to me ) . as i was wondering just where in the heck they got the gas to run their machines , they boogie on into a dilapidated city , deciding this might be a good place to set up camp ... and this is about the time the , as the boys from mst3k would say , the ` deep hurting ' began as the characters started to actually talk . anyway , the find a deserted research facility , complete with canned food , plants ( fresh vegetables and fruit ) , and fresh water , littered with gnawed on corpses ... well , it 's not completely deserted , as there 's the rats , and plenty of them . they clear out the dead bodies , move into their new digs , and soon enough the mutated , furry , super rodents begin picking off the gang one by one . not only that , but the verminous mongrels have eaten up the tires on the vehicles , preventing those who have n't become all ate up from leaving . as tensions rise , more annoying characters die ( thankfully ) , and leadership of the gang comes into question , but there 's little time for debate as the hairy horde begin their relentless onslaught ( apparently grungy bikers are good eatin ' ... who knew ? ) challenging man 's long standing position on the top of the food chain ... seems pretty straightforward , right ? well , perhaps , but essentially what i did was put a nice sheen on a stanky ( stank goes well beyond stink ) turd , and believe me , that was not an easy task ... really , the absolute worst aspect of this film is the writing . here 's an example , once the rats begin killing off the characters , one woman spits out this little gem of brilliance , `` the idea of being killed right now really frightens me . '' and here 's another , as the leader of the gang prepares to flash fry a whole mess of rats with his flamethrower , `` i 'm going to warm their whiskers . '' oh criminey ... the film is filled with completely unnatural dialog , pointless interactions , accompanied by atrocious , awe inspiringly overblown performances . i swear , the actors chewed up more scenery than the rats themselves . as far as the characters go , a more irritating bunch you 'll rarely see . one ca n't help but root for the voracious rodentia . and get the names of some of these a-holes ... duke , video , lucifer , chocolate ... there was one character that was particularly loathsome in that of myrna , a leather clad woman who spent a great deal of time losing her marbles and screeching incoherently throughout the film . here 's another juicy line of idiocy , as one mook finds a bottle of booze and begins sucking it down ... '' hey , what an incredible drink ! `` ... yeah , drink up boyo , as your time is gon na come . i think the absolute worst scene for me was near the beginning , when the group found all the food and began celebrating by dumping sugar and flour all over each other , dancing about like mental deficients . the black woman , named chocolate ( nice ) , ends up covered in flour , and starts shouting how she 's white , while doing a very loose interpretation of an irish jig . the effects throughout were n't too bad , but mostly featured people off screen either throwing , or dumping rats onto the performers . there were a few gruesome bits , like the rat in the sleeping bag gag , and the exploding corpse piÒata filled with rodents , so fans of the visceral will find something to enjoy . now i 've read where some think the awful aspects of the film are intentional in a comedic sense , and even the back of the dvd case makes statements along these lines , but i honestly believe the original intent was to try and make a serious , scary film , and once the finished product was out there , everyone assumed it to be a joke , so mattei went along with this rather than cop to the fact he 's a lousy writer .... hell , that 's what i would have done , if i were in his italian loafers ... i suppose it does n't make a difference one way or another , as if you 're an aficionado of rotten , sleazy , awful cinema , this one 's right up your alley . as far as the directing , apparently mattei , who started working on this film right after completing a project with jess franco , keeps things moving along , disjointedly , but seems to have thankfully taken few cues from that spanish hack ( seriously , ever seen oasis of the zombies ? if so , you know what i 'm talking about ) . hey , at least there 's a decent nekkid chick in the movie , which is nearly spoiled by a nekkid man and the appearance of his wang dang doodle . as far as the ending , i did see it coming , and despite the fact it was completely ridiculous , it was suitable for this story . anchor bay entertainment provides on this dvd a very good-looking , widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) anamorphic print , along with mediocre dolby digital 2.0 audio ( some of it was really soft , in terms of the dialog , but perhaps that was for the best given the script ) . special features include a lengthy theatrical trailer , a bruno mattei bio , an interview with mattei titled ` hell rats of the living dead ' ( <NUM> minutes ) , and a 5x7 reproduction of original poster art included on an insert , the flipside listing the chapter stops . cookieman108 by the way , i think plenty of rats were harmed in the making of this film ... also , if you 're interested in buying this dvd , i 'd suggest doing what i did and buying the anchor bay dvd fright pack : man 's worst friends , which features six films including parasite ( <NUM> ) , lucio fulci 's the black cat ( <NUM> ) , slugs : the movie ( <NUM> ) , bruno mattei 's rats : night of terror ( <NUM> ) , zoltan , hound of dracula ( <NUM> ) , and dario argento 's the cat o ' nine tails ( <NUM> ) . it 's available here on the amazon website , at a really good price , and cheaper than buying the individual releases .
at last ! i can say that i know what a castrato being tortured with a power drill while an infinite number of monkeys scrape an infinite number of fingernails across an infinite number of blackboards sounds like . thanks , mandy
horrid movie . i ca n't believe how disappointed i am in this anime . i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad . but it 's not . the little girl annoyed me so much . i just ca n't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her . omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie . ca n't stop ranting yeah ... for those who have n't seen it , you might like it like everybody seems to but ... i would not recommend it at al
giordano is a pro from way back in the day ... he has n't been able to adjust to the changing styles and this art book is a sad display of that fact . i recommend getting a straight art instruction book from bridgman , hogarth , or loomis . this book shows his deplorable lack of anatomy knowledge ( seemed to be mainstay back in the <NUM> 's a la ditko & kirby anatomy ) , his simplistic 3d construction , and overdrawn oval shaped good girls , etc . he also graduated from the wally wood school of art where if you did n't know how to render anatomy you blacked it out . still , he was one of the prime lenders to the modern comic language , so i suppose this is some publisher 's way of patting him on the head and saying thanks for the memories . do n't expect to come away with any newer material already covered in `` how to draw comics the marvel way '' by stan lee and buscema ( very simplistic book but the comic dynamics are much better ) or any new sensitivity to modern storytelling . this book can not prepare you for any modern styles . ranks slightly better than a christopher hart book ( need i say more ... ? )
other than heavy metal drummer , this album is totally mediocre . this album is perhaps the most overated , overhyped alternative album of all time . i do not see what all the fuss was about . i guess that sums up wilco for me in general . i could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering . download heavy metal drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs
so i 'm not the only one who feels ripped off ! i was so angry when i played this ( on an excellent system and at a decent volume ) and discovered that many of the tracks are ( poor ) live recordings . like so many artists , he has passed his prime and his concert performances are but a pale imitation of the original recordings ; and it is those original recordings his fans remember and expect . i was so angry i was tempted to write to neil and complain . unlike one of your unhappy reviewers , i did not even have the benefit of a sticker warning of the live tracks . if you 're a real fan of the man , do n't buy it .
i would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good . overall the book in my mind can not even be compared to notes from underground which is a true existential work of art . my bias i believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person , not just simply more apathetic such as the strangers main character . i found the book to be very boring . this is just my opinion , and many people find the book great and i have no quarrel with that
thought this cd would be funny after seeing it promoted on john daily 's show . we tried everywhere to find it and finally found it on amazon . what a letdown we had after finally receiving it and listening to it . this was a total waste of our money . it was n't funny at all - would probably call it sick or stupid . thought this guy was a comedian - he must be on his downhill slide . he is n't funny at all ! please do n't waste your money on this one .
this reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first dash mystery , because it would have been her last . ms. benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment . if you 're looking to try her work , go straight to her first book . in this book , rachel alexander comes off as not very likeable : wearing the victim 's clothes and jewelry , sleeping with the victim 's boyfriend , trying to live the victim 's life .... all of this has rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman ... in fact , her treatment of the victim 's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one . this reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim 's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all . and not enough dash in this book ! dash is but a secondary decoration in this book ... and rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night , and leaves him behind ! ! ! the only good things i can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim 's last moment until the book 's end ; the problem is that by that point , you 'll not care if rachel herself winds up sharing the victim 's fate . ms. benjamin is a better writer than this ; her character needs rehabilitation after this book ..... the readership deserves more dash and less trash ..... this reviewer 's advice : only resort to this dash mystery when you 've read all of the others .....
sallie ann glassman is not a mambo ! she does attempt to pimp lwa for her performances and for her weekly `` ceremonies '' . any serious mambo and hougan ( and even practitioner of haitian vodou ) will laugh when they hear the following : sallie ann glassman 's `` house '' does not have grades ! traditional haitian vodou knows <NUM> grades of initiation ! sallie ann glassman does not perform the priye ginea because it was catholic ... she opted for an invocation to the four directions and four elements lifted from either the oto or wicca or enochian tradition , but done in french , to sound like creole - so the average tourist would not know that it was just some invocation from another tradition that had nothing to do with vodou . when she takes people to haiti for initiation ( remember : no grades ! ) she gives them pot tets filled with a feather and <NUM> or <NUM> other items . she does not teach passwords or handshakes to her initiates - who , again , have not received any grade ! to make a long story short , this book and the author are great bogus and have nothing to do with real haitian vodou
i purchased hotel costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then <NUM> . i do n't know why i skipped <NUM> and bought <NUM> first . but <NUM> and <NUM> is n't worth listening to , unless you want the whole collection of the hotel costes series
i found this dvd real cheap and bought it . i really tried hard to like the movie , but i just could n't because the acting was incredibly bad , especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city . even the guys who do n't have lines display bad performances . an hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie . i broke this dvd and threw it out , something i 've only done to 4-5 dvds i felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth
the feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness , i could n't fully submerge myself into the book because it did n't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material . it read like conjecture for a lot of it , with `` could '' , `` would have '' , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor , at the same time , it was too conversational , and in all just poorly written . the material was interesting enough , and her conjectures intriguing , it was just the presentation that was faulty . it would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures , as it is ... she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel , and it would have carried better .
there is not a single word in this book that is true . dna of kids today is no way different from the previous generations . this is absolute garbage and has no basis in any scientific or spiritual reality . of any sort
the great one ( who is also a producer here ) takes up one of his worst films , namely sleep-inducing ` the foreigner , ' and he does the same role that nobody seems to remember . one good news is that the sequel turns out more decent than the original , but that is n't saying much . in ` black dawn ' steven seagal plays jonathan cold again , who is at first seen helping the brother of one bad arms dealer break out of jail , apparently working for the bad guys . well , perhaps he should have , for in that case things might have been more interesting than this dull b action film . besides the obvious stunt doubles , the inept editing , and the chubby face of the star who seems to prefer to stay out of the ` action scenes , ' you will see cia agent played by tamara davies , also former protÈgÈ of cold . there is one so-so action involving a runaway garbage truck and some ok shoot-outs , but their terrible acting which occupies most of the second half of the film makes everything dull in the end . the idea of chechen terrorists or nuke attack are reduced to nothing because of the hulk of the star who seems not to care . what you see ` in black dawn ' is your former aikido sensei getting lazy in his work . that 's a sad thing to see
use disc as a coaster . everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves . this is one of the worst films ever made ... and not in a good way
ok , the cover looks like a clone of miracle with kurt russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it . west looks really young so this is probably a made for tv british film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of west recent critical acclaim on hbo 's the wire and on the success of disney 's miracle . i did n't finish the movie because i honestly did n't care who won the boat race . unlike miracle which keeps you watching despite russell 's wardrobe and great looking toupee , this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast
i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack ... they are horrible pieces of s $ # ! ? * & % # ! # $ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put `` low rider '' on the soundtrack , how cheap is that
the above entitled collection was a real disappointment . not at all what i expected and definitely not worth the money . quite frankly , i was so disappointed i threw them in the trash . i know there has to be good w.c. fields films out there , however w.c. fields : <NUM> short films-criterion collection is not one of them bill william
i saw the author during a book signing on television . i saw a young , intelligent , articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about american culture . i picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas . unfortunately , though there is a lot of meat in this book , simply put , i was bored ... bored ... bored . this is not a subject i take lightly and believe me , i wanted to like this book because i like the author . i have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here . there is a lot of data and no real point . a lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me
pure pretention . anyone really interested in true post-modern art can find more compelling works elsewhere . minus <NUM> stars .
i know i 'll get criticized for not `` getting '' this book . i read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the red scare of the 50s , numerous autobiographies , stories of the business side of the biz , and other novels such as this . most of my novels have been of more recent history and i read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era . frankly , this bizarre underbelly of hollywood is off the charts . the one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period , the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today . do n't know why i did n't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned , it 's not for everyone .
ni se molesten en comprar esta basura , no sirve , nada que ver , el problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman , el ritmo tampoco ayuda , el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este . el anterior le da <NUM> patas a este , al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel ) tanta espera para nada ..........
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well . i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative . and this is exactly what `` insomnia '' is . this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read sep. <NUM> , 1990- nov <NUM> , 1993- three years in which king took to write this book . three years which were evidently wasted . the other king books i 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` insomnia 's '' ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . he is strong , kind , has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable . his counterpart lois chasse does n't come across as identifiable . instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph . king does n't usually do that with his secondary characters . other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable , like ed and helen deepenau , the three bald doctors , and ralph 's numerous confidantes . then there 's the whole abortion mess . this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device . i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself , 'how is king going to get through this ? ' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story , he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . this is a useful tool for a beginning writer , but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . one last thing , the villians just do n't work . they are not frightening , they are not demonic , they are not vicious or malign . three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors ? their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone ? the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness . then there 's the crimson king , the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page <NUM> who finally enters the story on page <NUM> as a catfish in one of the most terrible , anti-climactic scenes ever rendered . i rest my case .
if axiom of choice have a great talent , it 's for getting their music fairly widely known . but a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend . there 's some richer music on this cd , a song or <NUM> , but not really . for music like this , i recommend other people such as vas , rasa , stellamara , & amp ; even loreena mckennitt
found recipes dated , layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful , its generally from another era . bought gourmet cook book instead
i do n't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here . it is a big disappointment . while this book has some interesting tips between the lines ( that 's why i give it <NUM> stars instead of one ) , it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer . the <NUM> `` solutions '' are at best <NUM> anecdotal stories . take solution # <NUM> `` how to shoot in a boat '' for example , it reads , in its entirety `` i always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle . you 've read my exploits in the air and on the ground , but what about in the water ? shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday i will master . not wanting to delve into jet skis , ski-dos , or speedboats , i will be discussing motorboats and sailboats . '' great solution chuck ! that really makes my filming much better . perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into <NUM> tips and solutions , but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information . furthermore , the cover says , `` solve any video or edit problem in <NUM> minutes or less '' . not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is . the picture of a consumer dv camera also has nothing to do with the content , because chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book , stuff that takes more than <NUM> minutes to just unpack by the way . i have n't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet , but do n't waste your money on this one . try any other
when i played the first composition on this cd , i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping . but after that , this cd is disapointing to me . there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable . with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd , joyce cooling could have made one good cd . but , in my opinion , there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd . joyce certainly has potential , but she needs to work on her creativity . she sound here like an artist still maturing in style
on the surface maid in manhattan it seems like a light romantic comedy with a predictable and sweet love story . however the numerous racist and sexist stereotypes throughout the undertones of this cinderella tale will make any viewer of color extremely bitter . better have a couple of barf bags around while watching this movie . you 're gon na need them . jennifer lopez is a maid in a four-star downtown manhattan hotel . ( stereotype # <NUM> about latinas ) she dreams of becoming a hotel manager ( stereotype # <NUM> about latinas- all work in service jobs ) . a single mother ( stereotype # <NUM> ) she struggles to work during the day and take care of her 10-year-old son and is supported by her mother ( stereotype # <NUM> ) who works in a rundown spanish restaurant uptown ( stereotype # <NUM> ) while cleaning the room of a rich british woman , she decides to try on some of her clothes . conveniently , a rich senate candidate comes to the room and mistakes her for the hotel guest . he 's smitten by her charm and her looks . she 's attracted to his loot . so to bag the rich guy she and her friends ( also minority stereotypes ) go along with the ruse and more supposedly humorous hijinks ensue . the flimsy story disappears and the movie slowly changes from a vehichle for jennifer lopez , actress into a vanity project for j . lo , superstar . we get numerous shots of her walking around the city in designer clothes , eating at fancy restaurants and trying too hard to look hot while courting a bored senate candidate . the movie comes to a climax when the ruse is revealed . she and her friends at the hotel are fired and her dreams of becoming a hotel manager are crushed . but wait-prince charming ( tm ) is riding down in his white limo to save her . he 's had such a wonderful time with her that he 's fallen in love ( tm ) . he tries to talk to her in the street , but she gives him some spiel about not knowing who she was when she was a maid and now caring about her . this leads to him seeking her out at her new job . while she 's working at another hotel , where he 's conveniently he 's holding a press conference , he finds her and professes undying love for her . they kiss and we get a montage of pictures showing them living happily ever set to j.lo 's painful butchering of diana ross ' classic `` i 'm coming out . '' she 's married to the senator , getting the management job at the hotel and then one of her saying they 're still married a year later . excuse me i have to go puke . ( i also have to reorder the barf bags ; no telling when i 'm going to need them for the next romantic comedy ) words ca n't describe how much i hate this movie . it 's an insult to women and minorities . maid in manhattan insidiously hides numerous racist and sexist messages under a beautiful front of pretty actors , lavish locations and luxury goods . the movie secretly tells women of color they ca n't find success without those essentials for success : expensive designer clothes , perfect make-up , beautiful hair and a rich white man to save them . worse , it tells women to lie and manipulate to get what they want . because we all know working hard takes way too much time from shopping . movies like this are n't bad ; they 're bad for you . watch too many movies like these and you 'll get your mind warped . it seems like the producers were trying to make a `` pretty woman '' type movie for j.lo but they did n't understand the execution of j.f . lawton 's brilliant concept . in an attempt to copy pretty woman , maid in manhattan tries to update the fairy tale by just using minority characters in most of the roles and fails miserably . there was a lot more under the surface of the richard gere/julia roberts vehichle than most people understand . pretty woman was n't an update of a fairytale it was a satire poking fun at the fairy tale . lawton was making fun of all the fairy tale stereotypes by using l.a 's downtrodden as the characters in the story . he was making the comment that to get to happily ever after both the man and the woman have to learn to value each other as equals . the acting here is horrible . no , scratch that it 's wretched . jennifer lopez is terrible . terrible singing , terrible acting and she did n't look too hot in all those designer clothes either . she has no chemistry with ralph finnes and adds no dimension whatsoever to her character . throughout the movie she 's just j.lo superstar playing dress up . after seeing this movie and enough i can tell you jennifer lopez 's acting career is in serious trouble . she 's gone from an actress who showed tremendous potential selena , out of sight , and anaconda to an egotistical over-the-top ham with no presence and no personality . ralph finnes is horribly miscast in the role of the senate candidate . i could n't believe he was from new york with that british accent that kept popping up in every scene . an actor of his caliber deserves better than this syrupy slop . bob hoskins must need some rent money because a fine actor like him deserves better than this . natasha richardson and amy sedaris chew on scenery while waiting for their paychecks to clear . tyler posey ( parker posey 's son ) is the only actor to give a good performance here . i 'd love to see more of him in the future . please , please if you value your daughter 's self-esteem do not let them watch this movie ! get them the wonderful bend it like beckham , akeelah and the bee , and disney 's mulan . the older crowds can get muriel 's wedding , j.f . lawton 's pretty woman or his hilarious cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death .
this book seems more like a review of records then adding anymore info . i doubt if any more research has gone in to this book then average high school graduate goes through . i felt it was a waste of time and money panka
another reviewer has stated that mark often.it 's good songs.small package.bring home some milk ok ? it gets out stains too
for my version of this album , o.g . means old guy . for my opinion , he is not a very good rapper . he should retire pernamently
as a gothic-horror-lover i bought this according to the high-praising reviews , acclaiming it as `` atmospheric '' , `` moody '' , `` stylish '' , `` gothic horror gem '' ... well ... if you ever saw terence fisher 's 'horror of dracula ' from <NUM> ( in fact <NUM> years before this film ! ) you know where the benchmark for classic gothic horror lies . this hammer horror movie masterpiece delivers not only the visual beauty of gothic atmosphere and technicolor delights , but also magnificent performances and dynamic suspense . kill , baby ... kill ! whereas is really a lame and tedious experience in this genre . despite of its overly moody gothic sets , the suspensful musical score and the lush settings and colors , there is really not enough atmosphere or suspense that may grip you and get you into the story . the plot is very weak and holds no real surprises . overall it looks rather cheap and lacks of good performances or dialogues ( whereof there are few ) . the repetitive all too long `` creepy shots '' can get really annoying even if the director tries really hard to make suspensful hitchcock-style camera work . sorry , but that 's not enough . this is neither a real gothic horror ( cause it 's too cheap ) nor a giallo ( cause there 's no gore ) . if you think that gothic atmosphere sets , `` endless spiral staircase shots '' and a more or less creepy child staring into the camera are enough to make a good horror movie , then this one 's for you . to everyone else i recommend any cushing/lee hammer movie or v.price poe movie for real atmospheric classic gothic horror !
i would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the ( short ) history and theory of video art . as such , i will say this book is a very basic , sort of bland overview of the langauge of video . it 's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and `` hip '' ; all the stills are well printed and all the big , `` in-vogue '' art star names are included ( but where are people like haron faroqi ? or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut ? ) with that said , there is little to no actual critical content in the writing . it introduces concepts in a very simple way , and does n't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization . i do n't know maybe i am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic , but i actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring . if you 're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends , one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called `` connoisseurship of video art '' and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at `` all the pretty pictures '' ( which i find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video ) , then this book is for you . if you 're looking for anything deeper than that , i would look elsewhere to titles like `` illuminating video : an essential guide to video art '' by david ross , doug hall , sally jo fifer , and david bolt .
i 'm glad to see i 'm not the only one to notice the anti-white preaching in this book . not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that . i was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned i already knew . i graduated from high school in '89 and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history . perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education .
this sounds more like a & quot ; country gospel quartet & quot ; collection . for a much better bluegrass collection , try rounder 's & quot ; <NUM> years of bluegrass. & quot ; much better gospel bluegrass cd 's are ricky skaggs ' & quot ; soldier of the cross & quot ; and the isaacs ' & quot ; increase my faith & quot ; or & quot ; pieces of our past. & quot
i 've made <NUM> of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more . if i had known what i now know before i bought the book , i 'd never have bought it . the first recipe was a complete bomb : the tofu and vegetable curry , p. <NUM> . i found it too hot and also bitter . thin , watery gravy ; very hot ; and a nasty , bitter taste -- yuck ! i love curries , but this was by far the worst i 've ever tasted . i 'll never make it again ! the butternut squash soup , p. <NUM> , was a little better . i liked it , but my husband did n't and would n't eat it ( complained of a sour-milk taste ) . the soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking . and since cut-up squash is n't available in my town , the recipe took an hour of hard work , mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash . i 'll make this again when i can find cut-up squash , but i 'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking . when the slow cooking is done , i 'll puree the soup , then add the soy milk and margarine , and reheat gently on the stovetop . i think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product . my recommendation to others : do n't waste your money on this clunker
i bought this never having problems from amazon.com before . they did not state that this was a sony product and when i received it , all the cd had on it was a root kit virus . it would not even play in my cd player . when i tried to read the cd to copy and burn the `` wav '' files to a new cd so i could just listen to the music , all there were on the cd was executables and no sound files . sony is very poor quality now and i do not want to buy it again
when i was considering buying this film , i read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative , i decided to get it anyway because i am a huge fan of jane austen 's books and like bbc 's movies . i was very disapointed after watching it ! this was one of the worst movies i have seen . i could not believe it ! the music was much to modern for time period , and they made the movie much too creepy , whereas the book is much more lighthearted , though there are some dark parts to it . if you 're considering buying this , i would advise against it . i hate to be negative , but watching this movie was a waste of time .
i like what phil rogers said about cetacean . but to me , cetacean does n't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic . as a matter of fact , it 's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop . susan does n't impress me . i do n't hear what nicjaytee hears in it . cj & the fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called zacariah . and zacariah is n't included at amazon . so allow me to say something about it here . ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs ? well , let it be known that barry melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called all i need : `` all i need to have a good time is a reefer , a woman , and a bottle of wine . with those <NUM> things i do n't need no sunshine . a reefer , a woman , and a bottle of wine . all i want is to never grow old . i want to wash in a bathtub of gold . i want <NUM> kilos already rolled . i want to wash in a bathtub of gold . i wan na light my cigars with 10-dollars bills . i 'd like to have a cattle ranch in beverly hills . i 'd like a bottle of red-eye that 's always filled . i 'd like to have a cattle ranch in beverly hills .
although the video was easy to follow , there was no variation between the segments . the <NUM> minute segments were basically the same . i was looking for a quick video that i can do in the morning but it seemed that i spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves . if you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you
i rented this thinking it was an audrey tautou flick , but it is n't . she 's front-and-center on the cover line-up , but she 's only in a few scenes . that is n't the real reason why i think that this movie is so-so . there really is n't much in this movie that i have n't seen done elsewhere . i kept thinking that i 've seen other movies do this or that better . then again , i 've seen a lot of foreign and independant films , so i 've gotten a bit picky at times . nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one . it 's a mediocre flick , i do n't know why it got rave reviews . i remember seeing the dvd in a sale bin at a discount store for $ <NUM> but i thought it would be a waste , because seeing it once was enough and i do n't feel like i 'll ever need to see it again
just be sure to read up on this closely ... it 's not the orchestra you hear in the movie , and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents enya and annie lennox , replaced by no-name voices . this is not bad music , but do n't think you 're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-cd set
this book is not for people of color . paula begoun only devotes <NUM> pages to information regarding black hair , and actually has the audicity to say , `` suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color . '' is she crazy ? ? ? this statement is extremely offensive . ( would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people ? ) this is a part of our genetics and our looks . does paula notice all of the models , actresses , singers and even politicians who are black ( women ) who wear their hair natural ? ? ? even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours ! ! if she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable , then she should not write books abour hair care , and go live by herself on an island ( which is obviously where she has been ) . paula sweetie , stop sniffing hair care products ..
i loved the original movie , and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome.wrong wrong wrong ! ! first of all , the child actors were horrible , well the charlie and mike characters were ok , but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time . and what did they do to johnny depp ? he was so creepy and weird . i took my nine year old to see it in the theater , and even she almost fell asleep . if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
it had been years since i 'd heard this and thought i would add it to my collection , now i know why it has been years since i listened to it , i 'll continue with my ccw , bob seger , fleetwood mac ..
i have at least half of these armstrong 78s in my collection , and they are master pressings , not dubs . when played with a proper sized needle and equalized properly as well , they sound many times better than the tracks presented here . this collection is an inconsistent sonic mess . the timbre of the songs changes from track to track , some of the speeds are wrong , the volume levels are all over the place , and the overall listening experience is brash and painful . i do n't worry so much about surface noise , and this collection has plenty . but a bigger issue is the way the music has been eq 'd -- - in many cases an unnatural bass boost that makes the bottom end sound boxy and muddy , and which consequently makes the already-hyped highs sound even thinner and brasher by comparison . there was obviously no attempt made to properly compensate for the turnover frequencies of the original records , and it 's a big problem for me . the collection sounds like many contributors sent in material transferred/remastered 'their own way ' and the result was just thrown together as a finished product . i was very , very , very disappointed ; and feel that the inflated purchase price is not justified . the hard bound book is nice , but is mostly filled with fancy , decoratively framed pictures and montages ; very little real reading . also , after <NUM> or <NUM> 'readings ' , pages began to detach . extremely cheap manufacture . the cds had glue all over them , which i had to clean off before they would even play . there is mention in the notes about 'unauthorized ' reissues done previously ; i assume they are referring to the john r. t. davies version on british label jsp , which is sonically far superior to this set , and by the way , legal according to european copyright law . well , if columbia legacy could learn how to put out a decent product , people would buy it , and they would n't have to present mr. davies ' excellent work as suspect . do n't waste your money on this one
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
i was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the tv version i had originally seen . i did n't realize the dvd was being offered by a 'family values ' group . although the original version was barely pg , the editied version is now definitively g. several lines of dialogue between the <NUM> main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed . it 's still a good movie and if you have n't seen the original , you probably wo n't care . personally , i dropped off the dvd at the salvation army and just kept my video-taped off the tv version - commercials and all . for me , the interaction between the <NUM> main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $ <NUM> ( with shipping ) , so losing that was a big disappointment for me . for me , it was a waste of money . if you have kids , though , it would probably be a good buy
the ying yang twins are so bad that it is not even funny . now if they had talent then i could buy this cd , but that is not the case ..
in answer to a music fan from temple hills , the song was called king holiday by the king dream chorus & amp ; holiday crew . it came out on mercury in <NUM> and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned . it made no.30 on the r & amp ; b charts but did n't crossover pop . the lyrics are on the net ( try google ) but i do n't know if the song still is
half light ( craig rosenberg , <NUM> ) i 've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards , and it 's brought a somewhat related ( if tangentially ) point into focus for me : why it is that movies like darkness , the <NUM> spanish `` thriller '' with all the suspense of a pee wee herman monologue , and haute tension , france 's painfully bad <NUM> attempt at horror , come over to america and fall flat . well , i knew the answer , but really , you 're all providing me with more evidence . you 've never seen a good horror film in your life , have you ? because that 's really the only way i can see justifying darkness , haute tension , or half light as marginal , much less good , movies . demi moore plays rachel carlson , an american author living in scotland with her husband brian ( henry ian cusick ) and their son thomas ( the wonderfully-named beans el-balawi , recently in the tv adaptation of beneath the skin ) . thomas suffers a household accident , which leads to rachel and brian splitting up . rachel 's friend sharon ( coupling 's kate isitt ) finds sharon a lovely , secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write ( and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded , where they 're bound to be tormented by guilt ? ) . rachel meets a number of fine locals , including angus mcculloch ( the mists of avalon 's hans matheson ) , keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place , with whom she feels an instant attraction . despite being free of the marriage bond , rachel 's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger ... ... and neither are we . there 's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters , but it 's never realized . it 's probably off looking for the film 's suspense , which rosenberg reminds us we 're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clichÔøΩ in the entire book . once you 've figured out the movie 's big twists ( yes , there 's more than one , handled with all the delicacy afforded to , say , a road being repaved ) , which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film , rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end . there 's only one problem -- the movie 's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film 's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied . ( go look at the film boards in various places . there is one question that crops up over and over again . it relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across . ) it 's not often that i say darkness is better than another horror film . after all , darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible . but if you have died and gone to hell , and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity , darkness should be a no-brainer . yes , this one 's that bad .
it 's a little known fact but george peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series , frequently did not get along with his co-stars ( particularly mr.t ) and hate the child scripts that stephen candell would turn out each week . it 's easy to see why , two of the actors ; mr.t and dirk benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in <NUM> . dwight schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various tv movies and films , so he at least had some acting talent to speak of , but really the only real star of this series was george peppard , and his more memmorial tv work should be as the private insurance investigator , benecheck .
as an amazon reviewer , i have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that i have listened to that is worth reviewing . more often than not , i will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who have n't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it . however , i believe i have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it . chingy never was very talented , whether lyrically or flow-wise , but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use , helping make some of the song more listenable . but his follow-up is ... well , how can i describe while also being nice ... unmitigated crap . there , i used a big word in an attempt to be nice . even if you 're into the whole `` cash-money-hoes '' pop rap that 's been overtaking the mainstream , this album wo n't do a thing for you . some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young `` hood '' life experiences to make it their own , but chingy , other than his nasaly , thick accent , does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album . all that this album offers is more generic `` i 'm rich so i 'll flaunt it until you puke '' crap . worse , the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the `` music '' . i do n't even know if you can call this music , as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down . chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise . i ca n't believe i once even listened to this guy . it makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all . he and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives . and for the love of god , chingy , learn to spell ! you 're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like `` wurr da git it gurlz at '' and `` fall'n '' . i do n't see what 's so hard about spelling those right . here 's a short lesson : `` where are the get it girls ? '' and `` falling '' , my god , you ca n't even spell simple words right . bottom line : there is no reason why you should buy this album . like i said , even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms , you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once . you 'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full cd price for such a worthless waste of materials . for rap that actually warrants more than one listen , try busdriver or del tha funkee homosapien , who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow . for good music in general , listen to great metal bands like children of bodom and blind guardian , and maybe even some classical composers like dvorak and beethoven . those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than chingy has in his whole body . this cd gets no points whatsoever . i would also give <NUM> stars to it , but amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there 's at least a shred of quality on it , but this album does n't even deserve it . 0/1
these guys are the biggest joke in rock music . all of these <NUM> star reviews are an even bigger joke . ed kowizsychik ( sp ) or however you want to spell it sounds as pathetic as he looks . this is garbage , plain & simple . im glad radio is no longer saturated with their music . <NUM> years from now , no one will remember this group .
the beats are hot as fu * k but the singing is just terrible . the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all . you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs . but two stars for the beats . the lyrics are n't very good either
in this derivative , limp made for canadian tv movie , melanie griffith stumbled through the role of a glitzy `` courier '' for obviously illegal products . she has a younger live-in stud ( hugh dancy in a weak performance ) and is sent on a secretive mission by malcolm mcdowell ( he pops up in almost anything these days ) . melanie also has a sleazy additional boss ( played with absent malice by art malik ) who screws up the mcdowell deal and then demands eighty thousand dollars for the effort . along comes lovely rachael leigh cook ( who deserves better than this ) who suddenly becomes the true love of dancy 's miserable life . dancy is such a spineless cad one can hardly feel sympathy for the miss the three of them end up in . it 's all been done before and much much better . tempo is a composition without any heart
i so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book . i read it recently for a book club selection , and let me tell you , if i did n't have to read it , i would have put it down after the first twenty pages , and never picked it up again . i found it to be dark , depraved , disgusting , and depressing ! an examination of love in all it forms ? hardly ! these characters were just plain goofy . i finally figured it out towards the end of the book , these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually . they were looking to other humans to provide them with true love , and that is just barking up the wrong tree . i am giving it one star only for the rich use of language
this is movie is a nice big pile of warm doo doo.there nothing entertaining about this film horrible acting and serious over acting are just the beginning to this mess.no story to be found super bad special fx .i mean u can see raw meat toss about and the new guinea zombies look like brothers and sisters u find in compton california.and adding stock footage is plan lazy.i do n't know if the person who directed this still alive if he is he should be made to work at mcdonald 's making fries for lif
this is a poor production when compared to the ken burn 's masterpiece `` baseball '' . only for the deeply committed yankee fans . it may be accurate but it is n't `` history
while the book was plentiful of wild , sensual fantasies , i was disappointed in some of them . many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates . if you 're looking for this type of book , i strongly recommend & quot ; women on top & quot ;
i 'm a huge bone fan and i expected a great dvd and it has many performances but the catch is that they lip sing on all there performances . so when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our cd 's we have of them . the only performance that they actually rap in this dvd is the <NUM> mtv awards and you can clearly tell the difference . but to bone 's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap . if it was n't for that great performance this would 've got <NUM> star . and the backstage seens were short and worthless basically . so even if your a huge bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned ...
sorry . i 'm as big of a bowie fan as anyone , but i have to be objective and honest : bowie 's output from 'let 's dance ' through this album , 'earthling ' , just flat out sucked . sure , there were good tracks here and there , but bowie 's heart just seemed to not be in his music . in the '70 's , he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon ... but commitment was in each of those recordings . beginning with 'let 's dance ' , it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern , but his head was somewhere else . take this album . it 's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based , but that style combined with bowie 's anthony newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting . the opening track , `` little wonder '' , is such an alarming turn-off that it 's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the cd . thankfully , beginning with his next album , <NUM> 's 'hours ' , bowie seemed content to accept his past , his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up . the result has been three excellent albums in a row ( 'hours ' , 'heathen ' , and 'reality ' )
i was disappointed in the quality of the recording . the needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d . that i had burned from an old vinyl record
i bought this video for my <NUM> 1/2 year old because he is very interested in the alphabet . the dvd was a huge disappointment because it did n't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words , etc . not suitable for my son 's age , boring and short . they sing a <NUM> second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked . not a good buy
this author has so much talent and paints the most exquisite pictures with words but the plot of this book was so fragmented , disorganized and unfocused that it distracted from his lovely writing style . i was n't sure if the book was about jack the ripper , peter pan , alice in wonderland , a christmas carol , losing a child , hauntings , possession , redemption or all of the above because it kept going off in different directions . the relationships between the characters were confusing and the characters were never very well developed . worst of all , it just fell off at the end with no resolution . sometimes this works but it did n't work with this book . very disappointing
nothing is wrong with ` trauma ' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned . colin firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident , and john mathieson 's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting . except that , however , ` trauma ' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll . as for the film itself , it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery , drama , character study , or whatever that is worth spending my time . colin firth plays ben , who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife elisa ( naomie harris , '28 days later ' ) . in spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named charlotte ( mena suvari ) , ben 's mental condition gets worse and worse , and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares . in addition to the premise that is no longer original , the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress ( or singer ... sorry i forgot which ) that does not convince me at all . and the most surprising thing is , ben might be the prime suspect of the murder ! but how ? and why ? the script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things i pointed out above , ben must meet a seer ( played by brenda fricker ) who says something very predictable , and his estranged sister who is just forgettable . there are also big red ants crawling all over , paintings that imply nothing special , and the cctv surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in uk . all these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students . the difference is , probably they know what they are doing better . i simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking ( which it is not ) , and sincerely wish that mena suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days
this musician , if you can call him that , should be embarrassed . if he has something to say , more people would listen if he did n't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts . i wo n't be buying this and my kids wo n't either . repulsive
she has made a good albums and this one wasnt that better than emmas albums or victorias.shes my favorite spice but after the 90s is started to like all of them really.she was nice and brave i dont know as shes doing now tho without the spice girls beacuase when shed perform with them shed bring the word spice into spice girls . there is alot of rock music in this album too ! it would make a reat spice girls collection or melanie c fan collection so buy it !
horrible movie , only worth watching if you are a jayne mansfield or phyllis diller fan . movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about <NUM> scenes in entire movie . however , if you like cartoons , than you might like this movie . the singer laurie berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo . save your money for a fast food burger .
i did not like this album one bit , or one song . i had a hard time listening to it all the way through . i certainly would never listen to it a second time . affected and pretentious . miss fleming has a beautiful voice , but not here . the songs that were not ugly to begin with , ended up that way . so far i have `` standard '' albums from kiri , dawn , and now renee , please ladies let 's have no more of this , it does n't work .
alas , this book was a very disappointing reading . its one of the biggest sins is having a misleading title . `` sql server architecture and internals '' ? forget it . the first whole third of the book is win32 in a nutshell . it tells you about memory , processes , i/o and everything . but i already have my richter dog-eared all right , i would n't need a reminder in a book on sql server . then , about the sql server . internals ? what a joke . the only internals that you would find are names of the dlls where this or that sql server subsystem resides and a few hardcore debugger sessions to show you those dlls actually get loaded . uh-huh , thanks . can you imagine a book on sql server internals which does n't mention pages and/or extents ? in-depth description of different execution plans ? this is the one . what this book really is , is <NUM> chapters worth of overviews for more or less known sql server features . average-to-good overviews of a less known features . uhm , architecture , internals ? nope - sqlxml , dts , notification services , cursors , transactions . take cursors - it says there are four types of cursors , you know , static , etc . and shows an sql snippet for each . that 's basically it . take transactions - acid , isolation levels and usage hints . oh well , it could be worse ... difficult to say without reading other books by the same author ( not that i have an urge any more ) , but it appears he has written a whole series of them . you find sentences like `` in my other book ... '' all over the place . just love it : [ quote ] i must confess that i was conflicted when i sat down to write this chapter . i wrestled with whether to update the sqlxml coverage in my last book , which was more focused on the practical application of sqlxml but which i felt really needed updating , or to write something completely new on just the architectural aspects of sqlxml , with little or no discussion of how to apply them in practice . ultimately , i decided to do both things . [ /quote ] is n't it great ? oh , the chapter on full-text search was hilarious . how about this : [ quote ] communication between sql server and microsoft search occurs via a full-text provider . this provider resides in sqlftqry.dll in the binn folder under your default sql server installation . ... the sp_fulltext_ ... system procedures interact with it via the undocumented dbcc callfulltext command ... table 16.1 . dbcc callfulltext functions [ * * * a table of function ids taking the entire page * * * ] ... as a rule , you should n't call dbcc callfulltext in your own code . the function ids and parameters listed above could change between releases [ /quote ] what a heck did i just learn ? ? ? i thought this book would show me how to improve the performance of the applications that i write by knowing the database server architecture deeper . instead , i got a book of not so bad overviews of different things for which there either was no coverage in the previous books or the author thought a quick reminder would be nice . to be fair , some of the discussions were reasonably interesting , like chapter <NUM> `` query processor '' , but give me a break , it 's like <NUM> pages in a <NUM> pages book . do n't
the mixing on some tracks is awful , and at one point , vocals are lost altogether on the rascals track . i love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling ( i commute <NUM> miles round trip every day ) is great , but the quality could be lots better
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about <NUM> mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting <NUM> dollars
the sound quality on the dvd was atrocious . too bad , given the great burt bacharach score
annie proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media . this fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot . unfortunately , imagery is about all there is to recommend bad dirt : wyoming stories <NUM> . the narratives tend to drag in many of the stories , in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for . all in all , for this reader at least , a major disappointment . for readers who have enjoyed other works by proulx , i would n't recommend reading this one
what tedd tripp has to say may be true , but he says it without warmth , humor or compassion . if you 're looking for a good book on parenting from a christian perspective , pick up a book by dr. james dobson , dr. kevin leman , or gary chapman
i 'm amazed that the us still has to put up with this half baked rush release , if you want the fully realised package with english sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version isbn b000by9alu . ok so it 'll probably cost you twice as much and you 'll need a multi region player . but for something this good why put up with second best . this is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on , as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused . it continues the theme from gits <NUM> querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking . at times it gets a touch pretentious with batou and togusa swapping obscure quotations , but it is both beautiful and thought provoking . again a split review <NUM> for the film , <NUM> for the slipshod dvd release
my daughter and i had listened to the first two audio books , `` the bad beginning '' and `` the reptile room '' , both narrated by tim curry , so we were very disappointed by `` the wide room . '' tim curry was a fabulous narrator , why did they not continue to use him ? his voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it , and as an actor he really brought the book to life . often , the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with lemony snicket . his whiney , lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction . curry 's fabulous , velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story . lemony snicket narrating his own story is truly an `` unfortunate event !
nothing hear , just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man . whoa , if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions , i would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene .
this is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies i 've ever seen . daryl ( damon wayans ) and kevin ( david alan grier ) are two brothers who grew up on watching `` batman '' ... and nothing else is explored with that opening scene . kevin has grown up to be an writer for one crazed editor . daryl , on the other hand , is an inventor who , of course , has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off ... or will they ? yes , his tools are creative , but they serve no purpose other than comic relief , which i did n't find funny except for daryl 's embarassment . sadly , the two brothers ' grandmother is killed because she works for a city mayor nominee who ticked off a cliched mobster ( jon polito ) . daryl swears revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout ( which i 'm surprised nobody finds since it 's at the end of a train track ) . let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie . the bickering between straight-laced kevin and wannabe idealist daryl is side-splitting . in fact , just about every scene with these two is very funny . the problem with this movie is that it has such a dark , dramatic tone in some scenes that just does n't fit . for example , blankman takes a reporter ( robin givens , who 's basically a black version of lois lane - that 's not a racial slur ) to this hideout , but there is some music that reminds me of a despressed version of danny elfman 's score of `` edward scissorhands , '' and some comedic actors trying to be serious about the world and love . that scene is absolutely disastrous . there 's another scene when the mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks blankman to be present for the dedication . but then polito 's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the mayor , and possibly other people . this is not funny ! the movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all , but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in `` do n't be a menace in south central ... '' the contrast of tones and themes do n't work . another case in point , blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around , but then blankman 's genius idea is `` slap me around and call me susan ! '' the scene is funny , if improbable ... but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me . maybe i 'm taking this movie too seriously , but when i see some jabs at classic superheroism that make me laugh uncontrollably ( daryl 's inability to face life seriously instead of as a tv show is priceless ) , and then see some drama that is not only misplaced , but also horribly filmed and acted , then the potential hides itself underneath a movie that 's trying to be a superhero comedy `` plus '' an urban drama `` plus '' a hip-hop flick . this movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control . i really want to like this movie , but it strikes so many wrong notes that i ca n't quite recommend it
the author is obviously as out of her element as inspector monk , and clearly has little knowledge of the ships , seafaring , nautical quarantine requirements , etc . of the <NUM> 's . her characters are hardly believable : sutton , the rat exterminator and dr. crow are perhaps the worst examples , but not the only ones . would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function ? very disappointing
most of the people looking at this book most likely already have an interest in women 's studies , feminism , and the like . if that 's you , you 're going to be disappointed . you could already guess the author 's point and what she 's going to say , and she offers it all up without any interesting insights . if you 're just interested in stripping , you 'll also be disappointed , because there 's nothing particularly compelling about her story or the `` back stage '' scenes she offers . if you 're familiar with eaves 's reporting , from slate magazine and such , you 'll already be familiar with her style -- superficial analysis and lack of compelling argument or detail . skip this book -- there are better feminist analyses of stripping out there , and there are much more interesting stripper `` tell-all '' autobiographies as well .
mtv unplugged <NUM> was a great album , that blended very well . unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs
sounds like every other i 'm such a sensitive sad male garbage that is flooding corporate radio stations . boo hoo . the bravado of these people to take a beautiful song ( all is full of love ) and puke on it . it really makes me sick to my stomach
when it comes to big star 's <NUM> 's output , you can call me a hopeless fanboy , because after listening to in space , it seems that only a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later , exactly one-half of the classic big star lineup could -- -or in forever difficult alex chilton 's case , would be so inclined -- -to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great . this disc has way more in common with chilton 's oft-times difficult , mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of big star 's previous fascinating pop near-perfection . while i 'll admit that i have enjoyed a good chunk of chilton 's solo work , ( in a slightly guilty , rolling-my-eyes , `` oh ... that alex ! '' sorta way ... ) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that this group and that this particular collection of songs are presented as `` big star . '' in space is connected musically to the original big star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in this band were in that band . if you do n't expect much , you wo n't be disappointed .
the stories collected in this book offer the promise of exciting stories dealing with the knights templar , a topic that begs to be handled intelligently in fiction format . what the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue , educate or even entertain . the authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right , but that is not evident with these stories . some are poorly written ( such as & quot ; the city of brass & quot ; ) and others deal with the topic of the templars in ridiculous ways . one thing that really bothered me was the addition of kurtz 's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books ! basically , i would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story . very poorly thought out . the best thing about this collection ( and the only reason i gave it two stars ) were the interludes between stories , which offered up some basic info on the knights . definately not worth buying this book for , though
okay , ignoring the obvious fact that pyun made this ... `` film '' ... out of the scum that stuck to his shoes after walking through the cutting rooms of <NUM> or <NUM> other really crappy movies - all involving ... cityscapes and leather , i 'd guess ... where was i ... oh yeah . and leaving aside the question of whether any of these actors has every really been good ( i love them all , you understand , but i also `` like '' starbucks coffee when kona is n't available - ie all the time except payday ) ... um , i feel that what sums this hunk of celery up is that the bad guys `` hide '' a huge bomb on the roof of the san francisco city hall , and then have a bunch of henchboobs `` guard '' it so 's hopper and pressly can get out of range . now , let 's recognize that city halls do n't tower over every other building in any city on earth ( this is reserved for the buildings of banks , insurance companies and general commercial piracy outfits ) . which means authorities would be able to see the spear carriers guarding the bomb and act accordingly . this you could see in any bad movie . perhaps not in the light of the feeling that some of the guards might wonder who would be guarding the bomb while it was their turn to get out of range , though . and how , really , do you sneak a bomb the size of an elephant onto the roof of a city hall . even pre 9/11 my imagination failed . but here 's where i had to look under the bottom of the disc 's case to see if somehow , something had fallen out of it . can i really believe ice-t would play a man stupid enough to attempt to take this roof by force ? no ladies and gents , a bad movie can be the most fun you 'll ever have with your clothes on , but this ticker goes too far , crosses a line ( trips over it actually ) , and stumbled into chaos . it was like having korean subtitles on under a cantonese audio track on a mime film of about ladan as told by swedish esperantists . and if you 're high enough to actually enjoy such a thing i 'd suggest something in a medium budget godzilla , instead
some things are best left as they were . the first edition was simple to read , and did not seem to be trying to be the most complete guide to cruising ever written . unfortunately i loaned my copy to a friend and it never came back so i ordered a new copy and got this one . i think the author has tried to write about too many subjects and include too many different ideas- it comes off like a compendium of conflicting ideas . also this book more than the previous edition shows the author has a pretty big budget . not the best guide for those of us with more limited funds
`` with the dark magicks that fill these pages '' two types of cult could be founded : the cult of kon-stantinos , or a cult of complete cynicism . as someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs , i do not know which would be worse . the author 's insincerity is self-evident in every concept , and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering ... his tone is always `` prescient '' and always patronizing . the pseudo-goth aspect to kon 's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides , any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting . his obsession with `` naughty '' alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad . his spiritual perspective is the same : he plays with a safe `` bad boy '' boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the `` essentially i 'm not so bad '' image . the impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this . my one star i rate for `` nocturnicon '' comes from the book cover , which is far better than the book deserves , and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer . i have seen much worse get into print , including with his own publishing house , llewellyn publications . however if i was a cynic about occult arts , i would use this book to demonstrate why . as a reader i get the feeling that kon-stantinos feels the same . he 's looking to sell a concept , any concept . here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus <NUM> . it seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that `` little * * * * er '' ( he mentions in the intro ) in his head . either that or his misleading of the ( mainly young deluded goth ) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity . which makes him a true kon-man .
i was disappointed in this cd and have only played it once . there was nothing about the music that `` grabbed '' me or even made me identify with new orleans jazz or blues . not what i expected , but i was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort .
i hear this is a good movie , but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged . so what about quality control ? this disc should never have gotten out the door , but the odd thing is , i ordered <NUM> dvd 's from amazon - different titles , both damaged . are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us ? `` f
i saw this on a `` best of <NUM> '' list and i have to say i am disappointed . the musicality of this record is not too bad . it 's not terribly creative , but it is enjoyable . what really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics . unfortunately this is just another pop record , of which there are way too many these days . the only track on here that i would give a second listen too is seagull . i would n't recommend the rest of the album
i just saw gypsy and the well-known actress , patti lupone , playing and singing mama rose was superb . her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is rose . she soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever . i came home and put on midler 's gypsy , and it sounded flat , stale , weary , unprofitable . i have always liked bette midler , but this cd seems to have no dynamic , no sparkle . i think that you need a true broadway diva to sing rose , and perhaps even one with some operatic experience . i can only fervantly pray that the ravinia festival will release a dvd or a cd of the lupone production . it may be unfair to compare roses . midler does excel in different material but i do n't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is madame rose and to sing it
this cd is a total misrepresentation . many of the songs are very poorly done concert versions of songs . they even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs . buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection . do n't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits . <NUM> songs are live . one appears to be re-recorded . the rest are the originals . also , on cd # <NUM> many of the media tags are incorrect . when you play `` all i really need is you '' ( live ) the title `` heartbreak hotel '' shows . when you play `` headed for the future '' the song title `` all i really need is you '' shows . when you play `` heartbreak hotel '' the song title `` headed for the future '' shows . overall , a very sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality
i have to agree with anna hope 's review . this book was so painfully lame that i gave up on it two-thirds of the way through and stopped wasting my time ... something i very rarely do . but this book , while starting excitingly , soon dwindled into boredom and i realized that i could definitely put it down . i did n't care about the two main characters nor what happened with the storyline . as far as st. giles being beyond compare , try kresley cole . now that 's writing ; her books i hate to put down
bad movie , bad action and you do n't get to see almoust anything .... tho words : money waiste
this album is written for people that are emotionally <NUM> years old and insane . every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world . the end of ' i 'm gon na love her for both of us ' , when he keeps saying the title with different inflections ... do n't you just picture rainman rocking in a corner somewhere ? and if she does n't love him back , he 'll kill her ! unless she 's in bed with a group of his best friends ? ? no wonder 'everything is permitted . ' this is bad . the production is bad , the tone of the guitar is godawful , meat 's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far ( i know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back . i do n't hold it against him , but i 'm the one that has to listen to it . ) the band is fine , and i like some of the actual music . it 's the song titles and lyrics that are awful
sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost <NUM> year later i still havent gotten the book , a response from amazon , or a response from the shipper
the concept of this book could 've worked , but sparks did n't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track . it 's painfully obvious who is driving the car . the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying , as is their relationship . interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms . and the ending to the story is laughable . i wo n't give it away , but i 'm sure you can figure it out within the first <NUM> pages . i doubt i can read another sparks novel again .
i use to own this cd , but , i hated it and therefor ... did not listen to it much at all . i ended up donating it to the local library
i gave this <NUM> stars because i think dominique swan is right on - she was the most wonderful lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n ' rollers i thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever . but , it failed to impress . i was the dominique swan character , running after my favorite rock band because i was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him . i 've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that 's canceled because i loved that band so much . and my determination paid off ! * patting myself on the back * but the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie . the lesbian aspect was tripe , but i realize that were i in her ( dominique 's ) position at her age i would n't understand something like that either . the other characters were shallow , and it was n't all that swift a story line otherwise
triple bottom line ( 3bl ) accounting promises to keep score of `` people , profits , and planet '' -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results , but also its environmental , and social impact as well . it is , to be sure , a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large . and in business , what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking ? at one level , there is nothing not to like . it is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that . there is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet . there are two problems with 3bl , and this book glosses over or ignores both of them . the first problem is one of measurement . we can measure financial result with standard accounting tools . this is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system , some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure . moreover , we have a common unit of currency -- money . there is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact . quick example : a company that is passionate about its 3bl principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy africans . they proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation . problem is , the africans do n't want this stuff , so they dump it in their own landfills . the program is completely wasteful , but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3bl business . social and environmental accounting are in any case not new . the global reporting initiative ( gri ) , the sa <NUM> from social accountability international , the aa <NUM> from accountability , as well as parts of various iso standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior . 3bl contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that . andy savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy . but his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy , self-interested monolith . unfortunately , the new thinking he brings to 3bl is n't very good -- and the good thinking is n't very new
dru hill had some alright cuts , but were a dime a dozen r & b group . to me they were a poor man 's jodeci.sisqo had a decent voice , but seemed kind of gimmicky at times . `` tell me '' was a decent cut , but `` in my bed '' was my cut by them.i dug the re-mix.everything else i could take or leave
i did n't even want to see this movie , but my brother read the book and wanted to see it . ( we were unaware of the fact that this was n't meant to follow the book ... ) everything was poorly done in this movie . even hans zimmer 's score did n't save it . i 've mentioned that i 'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars , and if i could , i 'd give it negative ten
i was disappointed by this book . it does not help me to understand the 'truth ' about global warming . patrick michael 's subjective ranting throughout the book can be labelled 'humour ' , and 'readability ' , but i have to say that , for me , the rhetorical devices just put me off . it 's just sensationalising the subject . i can understand that he may feel he has a point here , and he may have one , i do n't know ( still ) , but , as a scientist , i find it impossible to take what he says seriously when it is just littered with remarks that would be better placed in a tabloid newspaper . he makes some good points about the links between science , media and funding - how organisations will link issues to the cute and furry animals and so on in order to get more support . but these have been made many years ago , and are n't news to me as a social scientist . ditto for the difficulties for attributing causality ( p.128 ) . what i find , as with lomborg 's book , is that these authors are so busy building a rebuttal to an argument that they themselves produce 'evidence ' that is just as biased , if not more so , the other way , and this reduces their credibility to anyone who is not already convinced that they are right . relying on the rhetoric of powerful soundbites to get those who agree with him is not going to convince those of us who are really trying to learn here .
i bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that i have not heard about before . well this book did n't do that . most of the stuff in this book i have read in other places and it was written better . like the `` red queen '' by matt ridley & `` why is sex fun '' by jarod diamond . this book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting . i found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics . if you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape , this book will give you plenty of that . other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book .
ok i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one takes the prize for worst movie ever . i am generally a big fan of <NUM> 's movies , especially 80s high school movies and chick flicks . but this was just so horrendously unfunny , pointless , dull and banal , with unsympathetic , flimsy characters and a weak plot . it tires so hard to be funny and emotional but fails miserably . i mean , the part where she says about how she 's with lloyd because he told her there was glass on the ground is just so artifical and contrived , yet it is supposed to be profound and emotional . i was actually embarassed to return this piece of garbage to the video shop . the two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and i fail to see what on earth john cusack 's character saw in the selfish , stuck up diane . i can not understand how anyone can give this movie a high rating , i can only assume that you 1. have all been smoking crack or 2. are all the same person . thank goodness cameron crowe 's films got better . please , do n't buy this pile of junk if you have any brains ! it will be two hours of you life wasted
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck . re : j czecholinski hey j , you could n't be more wrong ! your review is as flawed as lahaye and jenkin 's unbiblical writing . first , i am a christian who does believe that jesus is coming back , but i do not believe he is coming back in a secret , silent rapture that the left behind series is making millions of christians believe . i believe in the verse you used ( to try and prove me wrong ) , which is <NUM> thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'for the lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout , with the call of the archangel , and with the trumpet call of god . first , all the christians who have died will rise from the graves.then , together with them , we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and remain with him forever . ' when jesus comes back , we will know it . keys words being commanding shout and trumpet call of god . we 're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for <NUM> years . in the bible , <NUM> years refers to completeness or totality , which is time until jesus comes back for good . lahaye and jenkins are taking figurative language from john 's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies . this adding to scripture and polluting the word of god makes me think of galatians 1:6-9 which says : `` i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel -- which is really no gospel at all . evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of christ . but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you , let him be eternally condemned ! as we have already said , so now i say again : if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted , let him be eternally condemned ! '' this is what lahaye and jenkins are doing : perverting the gospel with their own spin . and your `` belief '' in the anti-christ is incorrect as well ( along with lahaye and jenkins ) . check out these verses : 1st john 2:22 `` who is the liar ? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ . such a man is the antichrist -- he denies the father and the son . '' or 1st john 4:3 `` ... but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god . this is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world . '' key words their being even now is already in the world . this is referring to satan who was in the world in john 's day and still in the world . the bible says in 1st john 2:18 that many anti-christs have come and anti-christ is anyone who is against christ . there are many people who are persecuting the church and christians ( as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd timothy <NUM> ) . why are we looking for somebody like nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the anti-christ ? why are polluting the word of god to try and sell books and movies . why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking ? do you think that the disciples , when jesus ascended to heaven , thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation ? no ! finally , you said that 2nd corinthians 6:2 says : `` today is the day of salvation i 'm looking so forward to that day when the lord will come for me and all born again believers that we wo n't have to endure the tortures during the tribulation . '' what bible version are you looking at . 2nd corinthians 6:2 clearly states : `` for he says , 'in the time of my favor i heard you , and in the day of salvation i helped you . ' i tell you , now is the time of god 's favor , now is the day of salvation . '' nothing about tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures ! ! ! you are just making up scripture , perverting the gospel ! now verse <NUM> talks about troubles ( lower-case `` t '' ) , hardships , distresses , etc . that is happening now , today until jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of god to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no <NUM> year tribulation period ! ! ! live today like it was your last day , because you could die or jesus could come back ( and believe me , you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent , secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years , i will continue to follow the god-breathed word of god and not fluff of lahaye and jenkins . `` tribulation '' is found once in the bible ( rev 7:14 niv ) and it is with a lower-case `` t '' and has nothing to do about what the books suggest . `` rapture '' never appears as this is a word that has n't been around that long . so in summary , jesus is coming back and we will know about it ( whether you are a christian or not ) . and off the subject , yes , baptism is essential to becoming a christian and being saved ( not praying jesus into your heart ) ... it seems that the same people who believe in lahaye 's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well . please do yourself a favor . read the bible and follow it . if you do that , then you wo n't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like j. czecholinski who can not even get his scriptures straight . re : j. czecholinski wow , j czecholinski 's perverting of the scripture is uncanny . somehow , he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with lahaye and jenkins . most of his words are empty , his verses taken out of context , the use of visions in revelation taken literal , and his best response is this : `` this thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past <NUM> years . '' wow , <NUM> years ! forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and jesus 's own words and the scriptures ( again i point to the verses you brought up 1st thessalonians 4:16-17 - loud command and trumpet call of god ! ! ! ) . and then he tries to debate the baptism issue which jesus and the disciples have passed down , but in the last <NUM> years new thinkers have changed that to just `` pray jesus into your heart '' , although there are many verses about baptism being essential and zero about praying jesus into your heart ( big one being said by peter , a disciple of jesus in acts 2:38 `` peter replied , `` repent and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins . and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit . '' then there is : matt 3:11 , john <NUM> ( water and spirit ! ) , acts 2:41 , acts 8:12-16 , acts 8:36-38 , acts 9:18 , acts 19:3-5 , acts 22:16 , romans <NUM> , <NUM> corinthians 12:13 , <NUM> corinthians 15:29 , galatians 3:27 , ephesians 4:5 , colossians 2:12 , and the list goes on and on although the bible never says to pray him into your heart ! i think the disciple peter said it best in 1st peter 3:18-22 `` for christ died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to god . he was put to death in the body but made alive by the spirit , through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built . in it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water , and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also -- not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god . it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ , who has gone into heaven and is at god 's right hand -- with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him . '' do n't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context . salvation requires : believe , confess , repent , baptism , and living by your faith . that is the belief that jesus and the apostles have passed down for <NUM> years . so j , you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last <NUM> to <NUM> years by man , but as for me , i will listen to the scriptures and to jesus and to paul and the apostles . for paul says in galatians 1:12 `` i did not receive it from any man , nor was i taught it ; rather , i received it by revelation from jesus christ . '' so there you go .
while this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of & quot ; all too common & quot ; web mistakes , i have to disagree with the author 's conclusions in many cases . in particular , he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible , responsible for poorly written content , lackluster site maintenance and other & quot ; bloopers & quot ; as he calls them . fact is , most web developers would love to spend the time & quot ; investing & quot ; in doing a thorough job . however , in many cases , the client often does n't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job . while there is enough blame to go around in poor web design , it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes . i also take exception to his commentary at times , in specific , his early mention of enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company . he points to a bold claim enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature . while enron may have troubles , it 's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers . we can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point . lastly , i found the layout to be a little difficult to read . often , the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about . the book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book . these are only a few points in a long list of what 's wrong with this book . while the author makes some valid points , i found this book a little too much to stomach . read at your own peril
do you really think cliches are the `` secrets of success ? '' this is a book to give to someone whom you know wo n't actually read it .
it is ok i think but too many tools are needed to do it properly . i travel a lot and ca n't take things with me all around , so do n't use it much but if you have all the tools at home it is effective . the abs section is at the end and very short too , mostlly focused on hips and tighs
i should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars matthew mcconaughey . mcconaughey plays one thing well - the smarmy yuppie . having grown up in a working class manhattan family , i know the type well . he does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again . this film is no exception . the worst thing about this movie is that even though i only watched about 2/3 , i had to use grease-cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime .
ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title . the review is for invasion of the boy snatchers . com'on people ! ! ! xp only <NUM> star for the idiots at amazon .
while i was watching this movie i thought to myself , `` am i going to die ? have i gone to horrible movie hell ? '' you see i was trapped in a theater . it 's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you ca n't leave cause b actors are pretending they can act just because they 're fat . the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it 's grossly bright outside and it 's a sunday afternoon and you 're in a car and you 've been sitting for <NUM> hours and you feel sweaty and there ' a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape . in conclusion , this movie turns me into melting snow . but i suppose there are worse movies -- ( see my review on gummo )
we 're huge monk fans , but how could they tear-out the spanish subtitles for season <NUM> ? this is an outrage and an insult . we 're two hugely disappointed fans . tony , make it right , please
bay of blood ( mario bava , <NUM> ) it amuses me that mario bava himself hated this movie . the first thing i thought after it was over was `` man , that was miles better than black sunday . '' it 's still not worth rewatching , but if you 've steered clear of bava after watching the borefest that was black sunday , this may entice you to at least give him another try . the plot , what little of it there is , is this ; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake ( the bay of the title ) . her daughter stages a suicide , so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves . a bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident . complications ensue . it 's hopelessly entangled in its own plot , despite that plot not being in any way complex . it throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity ( but some , at least , courtesy the lovely softcore actress brigitte skay ) , foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come . basically , it 's mindless fun . dario argento did it far better a few years later with profondo rosso ; see that instead . *
why does n't amazon mention that this video talks about wicca in their review or in their product description ? i also looked at the video in a store , and there was no mention of wicca on the case . that 's important information to leave out . if it were there , consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children .
i was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ecm masters . after struggling to listen to this album several times i have to say molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead , or perhaps find another producer for such outings . the electronic textures and ambience are fine , and the playing is nothing less than you would expect . really it 's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me . extremely cheesy and extremely cliche . my friend commented to me that it reminds him of a <NUM> 's movie soundtrack . i think that 's about right . molvaer is a great player , but he 's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record . for jazztronica i would go with dave douglas ' `` freak in '' or the aforementioned e.s.t
clocking in at just under two hours , i love your work leaves the viewer feeling as though from the opening sequence that stones have been tied to your feet and your body thrown into the very deep and dank water to slowly settle into the mud at the bottom . sound dreary ? then avoid this little mess of a film . it is hard to believe that adrian butchart who is giving us the radiant goal ! the dream begins trilogy could help write this script : one wonders if writer/director adam goldberg did n't just bring him in for help . the story is tired ( small time guy gives up love for a career as a movie star with all the accessories of money , fame , celeb status , gorgeous wife , etc . only to find life in its simpler fashion was preferable ) and the choices of casting this very dark and dreary tale are inappropriate . giovanni ribisi , superb an actor though he most assuredly is , simply is not credible as a movie star sex symbol whose stardom is accompanied by alcoholism , self hate , paranoia , fragmented thinking , and bad decisions . the only time we see anything vaguely suggestive of his ability to create a role is in the many flashback scenes ( with girlfriend christina ricci ) : his on screen chemistry with his famous wife mia ( the enormously talented franka potente who here is wasted in a mannequin 's role ) is nil , and his interplay with such actors as vince vaughn , marisa coughlan , judy greer , shalom harlow , joshua jackson , jason lee , and elvis costello is unilateral . goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner of artsy camera tricks that only serve to make the tedium increase . with a cast like this the product had promise . goldberg needs some time to think about this phase of his career . grady harp , november <NUM>
with the caliber of musicians playing on this album , i expected a hard hitting original . instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of `` filler '' salsa . no surprises here . the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious , you 'll play this one once
ok , first off , this is the first corrs release i 've listenend to . i 'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done . i 've listened to the cd <NUM> times or so , on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock . it sounds good . a little too good . i agree that it 's overproduced , does n't sound even remotely spontaneous . the studio work is well done , but overdone . i 'd like to hear something else to see what they really sound like . the content of the songs is what bothers me . aside from being sappy , sentimental drivvel ( this is pop music , after all - i was n't expecting anything else ) , everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack . mmm-hmm . track <NUM> - i see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at curves ( tm ) , then hopping in the ford expedition ( tm ) , and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a sunnyd ( tm ) in each hand . track <NUM> - helicopter pans out as mid-20 's girl drives curvy mountain road in vw cabrio ( tm ) ( r ) with top down , thinking about handsome lover ... `` lmn '' ( r ) watermark in lower-right corner of screen ... track <NUM> - sad animals . images of puppys in cages . track <NUM> - actually , i like this one . mellow , laid back . track <NUM> - ugh . track <NUM> - this one is the most clever ! i see the band members - <NUM> girls , <NUM> guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room , while <NUM> gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money , push it towards them and say , `` as you 're aware , the radio has lost it 's credibility . the kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there , beside what we pump across the airwaves at them . we need to entice them back . if you want a single , and this pile of cash says you do , then you 'll do what you can to save this dying medium . hell , you work in the word `` radio '' and we 'll double what we 're giving you . '' come on , the song even sounds like a psa for the international radio marketing council ... track <NUM> - sounds like a pepsi commercial . track <NUM> - ugh . wait , was n't this track <NUM> ? track <NUM> - sappy , but ok . sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics . thumbs up . track <NUM> - not remotely original , but alright . track <NUM> - interesting sound . good beat . correct me if i 'm worng , but was that a semi-pagan reference there ? that would be a bold move , for which i 'd applaud them , if in fact it is . not that i 'm pagan or anything , but hey , its a religiously positive , non-christian reference that does n't involve marilyn manson , and that takes guts . especially for radio-loving girls bands . track <NUM> - laid back . almost has a jazzy , lounge feel . track <NUM> - produced by former ace of base member ? bubbly , upbeat , not too bad . track <NUM> - written and produced by avril lavigne ... track <NUM> - wow ! a relatively celtic-sounding song from a relatively celtic band ! ! and instrumental , too - big thumbs up ! in fact , maybe that 's the key . whatever . long-winded , i know , but fair . this album did n't turn me off to the corrs completely , but i do n't have very high hopes now . flame away , kiddies .
so not at all what i was expecting . i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it , i was terribly disappointed and confused .
i made it to page two of the text ( page seven of the book ) and got disgusted with her style . from this page alone : ka-boom . and this man skinner . maniacal psychologist . baby in a box so as to raise her . whatever humanity he touched turned to bone . [ ? ] . this i know to be true . this much we presume we know . genuine court of law . boom-boom went the gun . note there is not one quotation mark here . this is her writing and the editor 's editing . i do n't know if i can go on ! i 'm very sorry i bought this book .
perhaps i was expecting too much , but i thought this set was a big letdown . in addition to the points brought up by some of the other reviewers ( missing tracks , songs out of sequence , etc . ) , i thought the sound quality was anything but excellent . i could see some of the recordings from the 30s sounding weak , but there is no excuse for those from the 40s and 50s sounding as poor as they do . i have a ton of 40s recordings and very few sound as bad as these do . hell , i have 78s that sound better . it 's a shame as i really like the sons of the pioneers , but for good quality cowboy recordings going to have to stick with riders in the sky until some one comes up with a better set than this
this is just absolutely terrible from beginning to end . i 'm so sick of these underground d -- -riders giving this <NUM> stars . this is garbage . i 'd much rather listen to a good commercial rap album than this garbage . the lyrics are boring and wack , the production is bad , and the concepts are stupid . i 'm gon na go pick up cam'ron 's new album `` killa season '' next week and i suggest you go do the same . for good west coast rap , wait for ice cube 's new album that comes out june 6th . this is one of the year 's worst albums
everytime & quot ; whoa now & quot ; comes on , i flip the channel . b rich is a disgrace to hip-hop . i hope he wo n't be around for a while . look at the album cover , that 's the worst i 've seen . pack yo bags and b poor
this was a very important record to young nerds who bought the nme and melody maker back in the day . this is supposed to be some sort of subversive stylistic endeavour , and maybe it is compared to your parents supertramp records , but it 's really about how cute young jim looked in his black outfit . i trudged along in my black outfit to see them when they toured oz in the early nineties and they did their bit by being hopeless musicians ( like all touring english bands of the time , such as mbv ) and storming off like spoilt brats after <NUM> minutes or so . it was a hell of a lot of fun i suppose , but not any more about making interesting music than supertramp , for instance
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
oo god , one more time ! this is a collection of the cream of the cream of the great american songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to american culture . this rate # <NUM> is to express my deep deception about the successful album series . over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully . i am not a dictator but i would vote for a law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of american culture . more than that , the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way . that 's the deal : there is truth missing , there is a sensation of a money-make production . mellow arrangements , neglectable performances , lacking creativeness . to be completely forgotten some years ahead .
i give a <NUM> star to the dvd 's not the movies . just to let you guys know about a new collector 's box set coming out soon . read below . yes ... looks like it 's true . we 've known for a while now that warner home video was working on new dvd special editions of the superman films to tie in with the release of bryan singer 's superman returns later this year ( in theaters 6/30 ) , but now we have the first actual confirmation ... from ilya salkind , who co-produced the first three superman films ! salkind has acknowledged that he 's working with warner on the new dvds , and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment , a-la last year 's batman anthology collection . by far the best news in all this , is that it seems that warner is finally allowing richard donner to create his original director 's cut of superman ii ! how damn cool is that ? ! as many of you know , donner directed superman : the movie and most of superman ii back to back , but was eventually fired from the sequel . director richard lester was hired to replace him , and it 's lester 's cut of the film that we 've seen all these years . what 's cool is that lester 's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well , so you 'll be able to fully explore both versions of superman ii on dvd this summer . lester may even do an interview for the dvd - something he 's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy . this information comes from salkind via the superman homepage fan site , which expects to publish a full interview with salkind in the coming weeks . very cool news indeed ( though keep in mind that until warner announces this set , it 's all still unofficial ) . thanks to bits reader matt k. for the heads-up on this .
if you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book . it blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve . example <NUM> . the problem of evil is solved thus : `` and god has done something about the problem of evil . he has done the most dramatic , costly , and effective thing possible by giving his son to die for evil men . '' example <NUM> . to john wisdoms damning parable , the book argues : `` for in christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving gardener ; we have the actual , empirical entrance of the gardener into the human scene in the person of christ ( cf . john <NUM> : 14,15 ) , and this entrance is verifiable by way of his resurrection . '' all of the arguments assume the ignorant position . the argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general . reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they were n't , we would n't be here . too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there . i 'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge .
<NUM> 's elvis presley as recorded at madison square garden is not elvis at the top of his game . the numerous covers he performs sound awful . i can give the album a few points for having some of his best known songs on it , unlike some of his live albums . although the set is good , the performances leave something to be desired.forget about this one and buy the nbc tv special cd instead
the very best of the dj tiesto real live show is the amazing synchronization between the music and the show ( lights , fireworks , etc . ) this dvd is totally unsync ; and does n't make justice to the real thing . the real thing is just amazing . the dvd version is just bad ; very bad . more than disappointed i hate the moment when i made my decision to bought this dvd . realy bad ! !
what made the original <NUM> zatoishi movies as one of the best creations in japanese movie history was its profoundness , the depth of a blind wandering swordsman , often lonely but inevitably beloved by some beautiful young women , usually giving you a helpless , melancholy , nostalgic romantic broken dream . the original zatoishi movies were also having the integrity of solid screenplays , fantastic directing , wonderful settings , perfect supporting performance , amazing fighting scenes and sequences , seamlessly perfected editings .... from the first two black and white ones to the other <NUM> colored ones , none of them was never seriously produced . and best of all , shintaro played the zatoishi role almost seamlessly perfect that oscar or any other kind of film festivals would suffice enough to honor him . i just do n't know and do n't see why and how this new addition would be necessary in any way . why suddenly the great zatoishi blind swordman became an overly ruthless , heartless , and cunning mobster , a stereotyped trademark of an vicious yakuza killer instead of guardian angel of the helpless common people ? so bloody and so pointlessly gory gross ? it 's a quite hollow and shallow one if compares to those originals . yes , the movie industry 's technique maybe more modern , but if we failed to deliver a better and newer version and interpretation of this great legend and character in japanese samurai genre , we better not , shall we say : you do n't need add crawling feet to a snake when trying to make a snake look more alive . it 's totally unnecessary
alicia drake writes well , that 's a given - she 's a journalist . she makes all the excess of paris during the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's come very much to life . cocaine , heroin , disco , silk and lace . but the main argument of her book , that karl lagerfeld and yves saint laurent are both sociopaths is not that earth shattering . after all , who is she intending to enlighten by this book : middle america ? - they could care less - the fashionistas ? - they already know all this stuff . drake does n't seem to understand that when writing a biography the last thing you want to do is create it in a vacuum . in the end , i did n't know anything more about lagerfeld and ysl than i did when i began this turgid ice-capade . the two enigmas remain enigmatic . her threads are stretched beyond their breaking points through their endless repetition and as with all fashion journalism , there 's a heavy air of self-hatred and revenge hanging over the whole endeavor
this pianist is painful to watch and boring to hear . we can only hope he is not the idol of a new generation of classical music listeners . it would be a bad omen for the future ...
i received this book for christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first <NUM> pages . the story itself is n't bad , but i found the writing styles simplistic and like i said before , annoying . the four main characters have no chemistry . they are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them . the same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again . here these people are , on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character 's mouth is , `` i sure wish i knew . '' hey look , i ca n't believe it , how did those people build gateways to other worlds ? boy , i sure wish i knew . hey ! look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect , how does it fly with such small wings ? i sure wish i knew . maybe i expected too much of this book since i do n't read sci-fi only . but as i said , i could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style . what a shame =
when i got this book , i could n't put it down . after reading it , i was anxious to get started on setting my goals as mr brown described in chapter <NUM> , but i hit a roadblock . mr. brown gives an example of the goal planner , but he did n't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month . mr. brown even states , `` the following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals . they are here to assist you in your planning . feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires . '' one frustrating problem , mr. brown gives no formulas . i followed up by going to mr. brown 's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration , i got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on `` need a financial plan . '' this requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $ <NUM> for mr. brown to preform the calculations for me ( the same calculations that should be outlined in chapter <NUM> ) . in addition , i get a free copy of a book that i just bought . what ? ! i bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals . or at least to understand how calculations are made before i seek out professional help . but mr brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn does n't fully explain them .
this hippy master of cheese made my middle years a living hell with his horrid m.o.r . sap toons ! how can anyone actually praise these corntastic am gold leftovers from an era that had some real music going on ? this is like putting air supply over the beatles as a great rock band -- -wake up america !
regarding the review of wesley horton ( edmond , ok ) on <NUM> january <NUM> , i agree with his assertion that the subject of the song was a plane crash , not a car crash . however , part of his argument for that is based on the following lyrics ; then i looked straight at the attendant ; his face is pale as it can be he bends and whispers something softly he says there 's no chance for me . i think he is assuming that the attendant is a male flight attendant , which would lend support to his claim that the song is about a plane crash . at that time , however , flight attendants <NUM> ) were almost exclusively female , and <NUM> ) were referred to as `` stewardesses , '' not `` flight attendants . '' ( the term `` flight attendant '' did not come into use until years after the song was written . ) i think the attendant referred to in the song is likely an * ambulance * attendant ( in the days before `` e.m.t . 's , '' etc . ) encountered after the crash . i agree with his assertion , but i think the support for it is based upon a faulty interpretation of the term `` attendant '' in this section of the lyrics
i am returning this book . i have not read it , i am angry the book has <NUM> pages , i am not sure it is an entire book . you had the audacity to charge me $ 4.98 when on the face of this book it is marked $ 2.99 . if that is the way you do business , i do n't want to do business with you .i feel cheated and disappointed
i was disappointed in this book after hearing friends rave about it . the illustrations are beautiful and the theme is endearing -- but , oh , how boring it is ! in our family , we make up our own words to go along with the great pictures
i ca n't speak with authority about other deseg cases , but i am knowledgeable about the st. louis case , having spent four years on the st. louis board of education ( <NUM> - 1993. ) . simply put , deseg has destroyed the st. louis public schools ( slpss ) , which were arguably , the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg , when they were segregated and run by white lutherans . today , after <NUM> years of deseg , the slpss are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of missouri . let 's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as kozol : costs deseg has cost the state of missouri about $ <NUM> billion between the kansas city and st. louis cases . the bill in k.c . totaled about $ 3.5 billion when it finally ended , while the st. louis case has almost certainly passed the $ <NUM> billion mark . ( these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media . ) what have we realized from this expenditure ? first of all , state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case . small , rural school districts routinely spend between $ 4,000 and $ 5,500 per pupil each year . in st. louis , the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $ 11,711 : yet , those rural , so-called `` out-state '' districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students , despite having half the resources . ( i 'm sure in kozol 's mind they are merely `` goyim , '' and deserve no better ... ) ironically , while less affluent `` out-state '' districts were robbed of state funding by deseg , the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg : since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer , ( rather than their `` marginal '' cost , ) wealthy districts such as clayton , ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues , although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more . ( for example , clayton currently spends about $ 15,000 per pupil per year . ) achievement in the slpss , half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests . this stat would be even worse , except that ( i am told ) the `` ld '' ( or `` learning disabled '' ) kids do not take the standardized tests . there are legions of ld kids ... in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety , a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s . that study , called the `` lissitz study '' revealed that city students ( i.e. , black students ) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps . that is , they improved less than students in all-black , the `` naturally '' -integrated , and `` magnet '' schools . when the educational testing service still `` normed '' the sats between <NUM> and <NUM> , the average slps student had a combined sat of <NUM> . worse yet , these were the best and most motivated students , with further educational aspirations , who `` self-selected '' themselves to take the sats and were therefore , a highly `` skewed '' sample relative to the average slps student . deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that , if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools , black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids . now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject , ( `` the coleman report , '' cited in `` brown v. board , '' ) kozol and deseg 's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of `` the bell curve '' in order to understand academic disparities between the races . vested interests it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system . this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a `` co-plaintiff '' in most ( if not all ) u.s. deseg cases , and is periodically distributed `` legal expenses '' by the federal courts . these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp , which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades . similarly , deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around . one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers . the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a. , and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections . essentially , the same black women who , <NUM> or <NUM> years ago were employed in middle-class households as `` domestic '' help , are now slps teachers and administrators . ( `` i is a teacher . '' ) how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg 's other defenders . if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s , more than half would test significantly below average : we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact ! approximately half of all slps teachers and about <NUM> % of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher 's college , which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of `` higher learning '' in missouri . last time i called their admissions office , i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of <NUM> . it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers . hypocrisy a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program . it does n't take a parent long to understand that deseg is n't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day , or your daughter gets beaten up because she wo n't date outside her race . now kozol may not have kids , but i 'll just bet that if he does , they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs , if any were available where he resides . ( the jews are mustard for this sort of thing , as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it does n't actually cost them anything ... ) i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle , the jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg 's `` voluntary inter-district coordinating council '' throughout the 1980s and 1990s . ( she was paid $ 60,000 per year , but from what i could discern , her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media , so the rubes out there would n't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing , gun-shot incident , murder , or race riot . ) i considered it an `` opportunity '' because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before : `` have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program ? '' ( that is , were her kids , who would have been `` poster children '' for the county-to-city deseg program , allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools ? ) what do you think was the answer , oh gentle reader ? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants , such as jonathan kozol ... ( i 'll give you a hint : susan uchitelle 's attitude toward deseg is very much like leona helmsley 's attitude toward taxes ... )
self indulgent , purile , child-like , pure unadulterated garbage of the highest order . a truly horrible movie .
just in the first few paragraphs alone she makes the same point about the smell of the slave market not being quite as strong because of the cool weather <NUM> times . it seemed like a redundant effort to fill pages with nonsensical information . if she had a better editor who helped her catch these errors she could concentrate on making an even deeper more rich story which i believe she desperately wants to accomplish . sorry to say i wo n't be reading another of her stories again
estrich is far from unbiased and makes an attempt to come off as such . she 's in the hip pocket of the liberals and is exactaly what her book claims coulter and her fans are . a friend forced me to reed this claiming it would forever change my views . quite the opposite . ann coulter wrote her book standing up for conservatives and christians since people like estrich is out there trying to say the liberal way a good person would think . everything else is wrong . she now comes out with phony outrage and tries to claim that the conservatives are the ones who have been attacking . fact is bill clinton did do monumentally fould and dangerous things to this country . when clinton was in office estrich defended everything he did . we had <NUM> terrorist attacks under clinton and she felt it was appauling to speek so negatively about a seeted president . what a double standard . now with this book she shows phoney moral outrage and copies coulter trying to reverse the flow . if you can , borrow this book , do n't waste your money . reed it if you plan to argue with someone though . it is full of flawed logic and total bull . it will make your arguing easy . libs hate facts
i 've been a merle haggard fan all my life and this cd is about as great as he gets . but , if you want the original recordings of these hits , look elsewhere
turns out i purchased this cd for one song . i was very disappointed with the rest of the cd . the song at last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd
both versions are pretty much the same quality , only one is b & w and the other in color . i ca n't think of a more childish or ridiculous story as this one . it 's embarrassing even to tell it here . on a humoristic level i could stand it ( like the marx brothers films ) , but this story is told seriously . the characters read their parts of the script , they do n't interpret it , because it 's impossible to be natural with such lines . maybe some kid would like this film today ; i doubt it
anna netrebko 's i puritani selections are way below the art and skill of callas , sills , sutherland , caballe , and gencer . she has no passion , no trills , no high notes that are deep and rich . her best is in the russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding mozart . her broadcast from the met live of the i puritani was alright , but scooping , avoidance of repetitions , running through passages like a locomotive , and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world .. scooping again , and a tight awful sounding high note . the same tentativenes is also here on this cd.she should know this . her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses , not the voice , which is forgiven everything . too bad ; she could be a lovely tatyana some day.also too , the traviata is not that great ; anna moffo , renee fleming , m. caballe , and of course maria callas .. listen to these and hear the difference
okay , i 've wanted this film for a very long time , so this year i finally get around to ordering it . however , i was n't aware that ridley scott ever put together a director 's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this dvd being the director 's cut . so , it gets delivered , i open it up excitedly ... and see a box on the cover that says includes ridley scott 's director 's cut with jerry goldsmith 's score . okay , cool . it includes the director 's cut . that implies that both the theatrical release and the director 's cut are on the disc . not so . this is only the director 's cut ... and to be honest , it 's not all that great . and goldsmith 's score is not one of his better ones . i was wanting the theatrical release with that wonderful score by tangerine dream , the version i remember seeing so many years ago . so , now i have to shell out the money for the ultimate edition which has both versions on it . if amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which . i feel about as shafted as when i bought `` the exorcist '' on dvd ... only to get the version you 've never seen , which was equally lame
i 've purchased seasons one and two thus far . if this third set is as poorly done as the first two , stear clear . if you remember the old lps that stated `` all songs performed by original artists '' meant that the songs were rerecorded . the first <NUM> sets were poorly done . season one , from nbc has been named `` bonus '' selections . this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season . the music on the series is nothing short of annnoying . it simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory . the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated . i ca n't get over the music . it is really that bad . bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers . one ca n't help but feel cheated when the waited for dvd set lacks the original audio ( replaced by truly awful songs ) , and the picture quality so poor
a few good things , but she 's lost her edge and i find it impossible to identify at all with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there , botoxed , massaged , pt-ed ... plus i 've never made $ 150,000+ per year so i feel like i live in another cosmos . besides , i live in france , where real faces are appreciated . constance rodrigu
melinda and melinda is a concept film . and a good concept at that . basically , two writers are having dinner with some friends and discussing whether life is comic or tragic . a friend begins to tell a story and each writer gives their perspective on how to make it a tragic or a comic tale . so begins our two movies within the movie . with the director , and such a great cast , you 'd think this film would easily be bound for greatness . on the contrary , you 're bound for boredom . the biggest problem with the movie is the casting of radha mitchell as melinda , the only character that is involved in both stories . her acting is stilted and she stumbles along taking scene after scene down with her . another fault is the fact that none of the other actors are in both stories . melinda and melinda would have been a much more interesting film ( both for the audience and for the actors ) if the entire cast would have been involved in both sides of the story . as it is , the story switches back and forth between the two at a confusing pace , and does n't apologize for moving slowly and drudgingly along . will ferrell offers the only breath of fresh air in this film as a married man who falls in love with melinda and ca n't tell her . overall , this movie is quite slow and although there are moments of clarity and even brilliance , you will find yourself wishing to fast forward til something intersting happens ... and if you do so , you may find you 've missed the whole movie
ok so now metallica decides hey lets ripe off some more people because we ca n't do our own stuff without it sucking ! you do know that dave from megadeth wrote all of there good songs . without dave around they sucked ! ! ! ! ! i have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and i would just like to for the most part this thing sucks ! ! ! ! the misfit 's song they did was the worst cover ever ! ! ! ! ! hell cof does a way better cover of a misfit song . if your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd 's . now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from slayer , megadeth , cannibal corpse , deicide , dimmu , and even cof because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out ! !
the album is rushed , being produced just in <NUM> days . it did not showcase casey 's talent and sales charts speak even louder . poor casey . she deserves a better album than this
i saw a few scenes and could n't even continue watching . i like a lot of charles bronson 's movies . examples include `` death hunt , '' the 80s `` death wish '' series , and `` the white buffalo . '' but his acting in this movie is unrealistic . he does not act like a real apache . bronson seems to overdo it on being `` stoic . '' a relative and i watched a few scenes and just switched channels . bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real apache . paul newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an apache-raised white man in `` hombre , '' which i purchased on amazon . i do applaud bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s . given the time period , perhaps bronson should have hired roman gabriel instead . he does a realistic job of portraying a cherokee indian in the `` undefeated , '' which was also released around the same time ( give or take a couple of years )
the only reason pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in nations such as india , pakistan , indonesia and parts of africa . firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the quran in a coherent fashion . people `` claim '' that he is very much true to the arabic of the quran ; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context . well that is the point how can it be a `` literal '' translation when it is infact out of context in most places . there is also an issue of a history with this translation , it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator ( pickthall ) but other individuals . most quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error . that is the problem , most readers who rely on the english ( first hand ) may not even know if there are errors . not only is this translation subjective , nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is not substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he ; ( or now in the case of so many revisions , as `` they '' ) did .
i have not read this book but i am a real life eunuch . i had my testicles surgically removed . in an interview on salon.com the author says `` castration does not get rid of the sexual drive , get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity . '' wrong ! ! ! how would he know any way ? he is not a eunuch . he has had a vasectomy but that is totally different . i can speak from experience ; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero . i had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone . the only way for a eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement . i have never heard of any real life eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive . do n't waste your time on this book ; the author obviously did n't do enough , if any research . if you want to learn about eunuchs then search the web . there are a lot of us out there , and our numbers are growing
let me first say this , roots is basically paul simon 's graceland , except nu-metalized . these guys went to south america , cut a couple of terrible tracks with `` natives '' ? , then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure . this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics , excessive `` guesting '' of other crappy artist , bad guitar , bad sitar ( ! ) , and the inclusion of anything to do with korn , all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and rambo style striped face paint . the biggest waste of time , money , and matter . its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using . a real bummer .
they introduced the red tape . uhmmm that made the whole movie null and void for me . after that it just seemed like a very drawn out veronica mars `` halloween '' episode . * spoilers * this film is about evil spirits who have a vendetta against pc 's , cellphones , and pda 's . god forbid you own either or else you will be visited by one of these beings . forget about being killed on the spot . it just makes you so depressed you want to commit suicide or better yet you turn into what looks like remnants of an ashtray . oh but wait , theres more you can keep the spirits at bay w/ red electrical tape . sounds preposterous right ? ! well it is . to sum up , this movie was a hot `` thrown together at the last minute '' mess .
this has to be my least favorite of my kiyosaki collection . i will sum it up for you ... think and know the power of leverage , passive income is taxed at a lower rate than earned income , and you got ta buy assets ! there , you can continue shopping
you know it 's interesting , when you open the ramtha web site of the `` school of wisdom '' , one finds a high school essay in neoplatonic metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats , however when you hit the link that says who is ramtha , you get a `` this information is not available '' message , kinda makes you go , hhmmmmmmm ? ? ? ? ! ! ! now do n't get me wrong folks , edgar cayce and the author of a course in miracles might have tapped into something , but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative , it kind of reminds me of the lines in the revenge of the sith movie that palpatine gave to anakin to turn him to the dark side ! ! ! ! ! you know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik , you know esteemed jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the sith ; or even tolkien 's saruman , hey folks get christopher lee 's opinion of the dvd before you fork over your hard earned bucks , and uh ... do a search on this ramtha spirit , er channeled , er thingy ! ! ! live long and prosper ! !
this book is a huge disappointment-it leaves out <NUM> % of the movie , and the pictures are only so-so.i do n't recommend this boring book to anyone who 's a die-hard poppins fan.all kids will do is look at the pictures to cure boredom , then toss the book aside and forget about it
this book is a complete waste of paper and ink . as another reviewer stated already i do n't get it . i got a little over half way through this book and hollered uncle . it made no sense and was headed nowhere
did n't like this one to much starts off ok and take a nose dive . the ending was crapping were stitch all of a sudden is well when he was dying . i like the first one much more than this one
the title of this book should be <NUM> things you really do n't need to know about disneyland . it was a complete waste of money and not at all interesting to read
that was the worst novel ever . i did n't follow the story line at all . it seemed so random , almost like there was n't a story line at all . i was soooo confused with the book because i did n't see any characters except some hydrogen , cobalt , and zinc oxide . there were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people . i was revolted when reading that <NUM> hydrogens married an oxygen . do not get this book . it is possibly the worst story i have had the misfortune to read
hardly any of this music was heard in the wonderful documentary series . a poor album by a decent fiddler but a genuinely lousy composer
this book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands ! if you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria , actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live , reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere . this book was too preachy and did n't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology , human physiology , or health .
for good and ill , i am one of the hippy westerners the book talks about . the little i know of taoism i know from a conversation with a friend and reading the tao of pooh . i bought this book while trying to learn more . the book is very up front about contradicting the seemingly widely held ( western ) view that taoism is largely about attitude and how you live life . this book is not about philosophy . the book is concrete how-to advice about practicing taoism in a traditional manner . different sections explain how to make your own altar and wand to use in rituals , why taoists should never participate in felatio , and introduce a whole pantheon of dieties to worship . it would also make a much better source for a school report about a religion than a philosophy text would . in general , i found the book interesting but not what i needed . from the start , i was turned off by the tone of the book . the introduction takes the attitude that new agers are messing up taoism and people interested in it as a philosophy should get lost . it makes some pretty broad declaratory statements about how all taoists live their lives , and tries very hard to push a `` one right way '' to being a taoist . the book could easily be completely right , and i 'm not an expert to say it is n't , but either it was n't what i was looking for or taoism is n't what i am looking for
as said by other reviewers , a lot of what was in the original story was changed , and the film was updated to the time period where it was . the boys are american , from a military school , and talk about fear of the russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams . the choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals . i do n't want to sound like i 'm stereotyping people in the military , but people in general already think there 's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal . basically , i think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost . you do n't feel like there 's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the <NUM> film . for example , during the bonfire sequence jack is shouting out directions : `` ok , you be the pig , we 'll be the hunters , '' and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire . ( not actually hurting him , mind you , just chasing him ) that 's not chaos nor barbarism , that 's an organized celebration . it 's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation . the director tries to play this scene out like it 's a terrible thing , but it just does n't come across that way . i might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation , that being the john hurt `` <NUM> . '' that film , if i recall correctly , did n't have a single `` big brother is watching you . '' likewise , this film does n't have a single , `` kill the pig , spill her blood ! '' that 's right , the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie . actually , a kid in one scene says quietly , `` we killed a pig . '' that 's about it . this leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior . the fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal , chanting and screaming , `` kill the pig ! slit her throat ! spill her blood ! '' was one of the most poignant moments of the book and <NUM> film , and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to `` tell me about the rabbits , george . '' on a final note , the character of piggy is ruined in this film . danuel pipoly was terrible in the role , and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play . i do n't wan na give too much away , but i was happy when `` something something '' happened to him . that sounds mean but it 's true , and it 's a very bad thing in a film like this . this film could have been good , but it fails on all levels . the transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable , making the whole point of the story lost on the audience . the best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end , and he 's in about ten seconds of film time . i hate comparing it to the <NUM> film version so much , but i would really suggest people see that instead . avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion
the two stars are for the entertainment value of this series . there 's no doubt that penn and teller can put on a show . however , this series proves very little . they employ the same techniques they blast as b.s . to make their points : questionable `` experts '' , misdirection , and even petty name calling . i have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are b.s. , but to say that penn and teller `` prove '' them wrong is stretching it . if you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility , watch this series . if you want to see well thought-out , unbiased skepticism , this is n't it .
if you happen upon the video for makedamnsure and the sound on your television is off , then you would think that the band taking back sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune . they look like the mc5 in the video , jumping off amps , winging guitars around there head , looking serious as all hell . but if your like me and you turn the sound back on , your going to hear that it 's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important . i was asked to listen to this by one of my friends . i gave it an honest to god listen , but i could n't handle it for too long . being earnest is fine , but stop with this emo stuff . you 'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it 's all the same . if you like emo , please , buy <NUM> songs by fugazi . they practically invented the genre , but i actually buy what they do . i do n't buy this crap , this is just the same drivel that i 've been hearing for ever . avoid at all costs .
yo nu-mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac . this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan . they take great songs and make crappy beats . get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money
sorry , i thought this would be a great updated version of the classic shr music - and i was really disappointed . i do n't really understand the point of this album - why `` remake '' music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place ? i ca n't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes ( and bottom line , was n't that the point ? ) ... and listening to `` no more kings '' was downright depressing - when shr has always had the exact-opposite effect !
the songs were cut to pieces to fit them on the cd . do n't bother , the great stuff was just ruined
if i had seen this in the movies , i would have walked out and asked for a refund . it was indescribably terrible . i returned this dvd because i really , really did n't like what i saw
apparently , their last work with frontman steve perry and quite the let down.'trial ... ' was the band 's '96 comeback attempt , but if i remember correctly this cd was a stiff from the get-go.i tried so hard to get into this fifteen track disc , but even with a duration of <NUM> minutes , i just couldn't.the songs do n't completely suck , they just do n't appear to have much life.fantastic cover , do n't you agree ? if you 're an old school journey fan , i encourage you to check out their new <NUM> release , 'generations ' with vocalist steve augeri , who 's been with the band for awhile now.that cd is surprisingly good , as i 'd give it <NUM> 1/2 , maybe <NUM> stars.keep in mind that guitarist neal schon is their 'key ' player
this book reads like a phd dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books , much like a college research paper . i wonder if these <NUM> star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and i ca n't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all
whatever happened to hey dude or salute your shorts ? those , for sure , should be on dvd . not the shows that are still on air
the first <NUM> minutes was ok. after that , this tv-movie started using all the cliches of ... a tv-movie . a bad one . these cliches include : <NUM> . many references to babies both on and off the plane . <NUM> . young love as apparently-orphaned young adults ponder their future together . <NUM> . a supposedly very drunk man becoming rowdy and argumentative , yet showing no real signs of being drunk though much was said about the volume of his drinking . <NUM> . an unhappy man dictating some thoughts - then eventually joyfully reconsidering his comments and throwing the tape recorder away . <NUM> . the expanded time frame , where events that would normally take perhaps a couple minutes dragged out for 1/2 hour - in this case the final descent of the plane . <NUM> . simplistic explanations of some `` technical jargon '' for the benefit of only the audience . <NUM> . voice-overs of the thoughts of some of the characters as they are about to land . there were also some bad lapses of reality . these include : <NUM> . the claim that the airplane had never been test-flown or simulated when out of gas . <NUM> . having some sports cars whiz by only feet away - on a wet surface no less - from recreational hot-rodders parked on the abandoned runway who are working on cars and milling about . <NUM> . the apparently stupid teen who ca n't hear his father yelling and waving at him from <NUM> feet away to get the hell off the runway as the plane is about to land on him . the worst for last ... <NUM> . no one even attempts any crash position during the landing . <NUM> . after landing , the pilot and co-pilot sit there for <NUM> seconds and contemplate the minor amount of smoke coming up through the console . note there is no actual fire whatsoever ... <NUM> . after all the passengers slide down the rear slide , the co-pilot and other crew slide down , and gather right at the bottom of the slide rather than , say , getting off the runway away from the plane . only the pilot remains on board . he lingers in the doorway , then decides to go back into the nose again . why ? to fight the nonexistent fire . egads ! he is now overcome by smoke . we wait and wait for him to reappear , but gosh , he does n't . so the crew must climb back up the ladder to rescue him . finally everyone gets off the plane . everyone cheers and congratulates the foolhardy pilot . the end . except it 's not . there is a freeze-frame on each of the characters with a caption telling what happens to them in the future . i wanted to give it at least <NUM> stars but in all honesty i ca n't .
shedaisy does not have the staying power . in a few years everyone will be saying `` shedaisy who ? '' their music is very forgettable !
i was extremely disappointed by this album . it just did n't grab me at all like fallen did . it has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable . i guess nightwish has spoiled me . before , evanescence was about the only female-fronted band i cared to listen to . now that i have discovered nightwish , evanescence just seems useless . sorry , but i just do n't care for it
because most everybody wanted to stick a dirty sock down eric burdon 's mouth , that 's why . the animals were great ( a later incarnation included andy summers ) , but burdon just absolutely alienated anyone with an iq of greater than & quot ; <NUM> & quot ; by his flat vocals and his embarrassingly poor jagger imitation
this book is lame . it 's black and white drawings are sloppy and they do n't instruct . there is little or no instructions this book is way over priced . stay away from it
after reading `` the kite runner '' - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship , loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in afghanistan during the russian war and the taliban rule , i set out expecting more of the same from the swallows of kabul . the latter was quite disapointing . the swallows of kabul focusses on <NUM> main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence , cruelty and desolation of their surroundings . the dismal context of this story is properly set up . enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the taliban and the desperation of the afghan people is clearly communicated . unfortunately , the novel reads like a short story . proper character development is not established , so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits . the novel is successful in painting a truly depressing picture of afghanistan , making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place . but if you 're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances , then i would n't recommend this book for you . i was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down
why does this cd not appeal to me ? well , it does n't have what it takes ( in my opinion ) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat . his previous songs did that . sure , will is growing and i hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me . i expected more . should you buy this cd ? sure ! if you 're a fan of will then go for it . if you want a totally different style of will then give it a bash . if you 're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then i suggest you pick another cd
never have i seen a movie violate a book so badly . john grisham 's runaway jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction , in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on big tobacco in the courtroom . the movie runaway jury is a slapped-together suspense chase , in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers . this movie is , at most , a caricature of the book , and not a flattering one at that . hackman transforms fitch 's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery ; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall . parts of marlee 's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events . the most interesting aspects of the story -- jury selection and nicholas easter 's manipulation of the court -- are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around . if i had never read the book , i would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick , rent-worthy at best . but knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad . even if you are n't a lover of fiction , i highly recommend buying the book instead .
james loewen 's `` lies '' is a valuable tool , debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions . where this critcal work fails , though , is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm american institutions . loewen 's praise of a figure like john brown does nothing to further this end . i do not believe , as the author does , that history as taught today is propaganda , but i do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose , and this being a capitalistic society , they are also written for consumers . i am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of christopher columbus bashing . it serves no interests to villify columbus in the name of historical accuracy . all who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity . loewen rails on about the `` exploitative '' element in columbus 's story , but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for african discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination . similarly , his accusation of lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present . it is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined . both the author and i agree that history is written by the victors , so why does loewen rehash this ad nausem ? loewen asks the question , `` how is one supposed to feel about the america that has been presented ? '' my answer after reading his book is , overwhelmingly negative and cynical . his criticism of texts , as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies , must be taken into account in teaching history , but his negative tone must be balanced . students do need to become , in loewen 's words , `` crap detectors . '' students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions , on that much i think we would agree
the song that ends the movie or is & quot ; send me on my way & quot ; by rusted root . that is worth getting . does anyone know what the other songs with singing are
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade , with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic . fortunately its been <NUM> weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind , but it was a mess .
an air force pilot [ ice-t ] fakes his own death only to resurface as the partner of a deadly latin american arms dealer [ andrew divoff ] . when a stealth gets stolen and it 's used to target the military , it 's up to one man [ costas mandylor ] to stop him before it 's too late . one thing that ca n't be denied is that this movie is boring . the action is not worth watching , the script is dumb , and the story just gets tiring after a while . ernie hudson 's acting talents are once again wasted in another low-rent direct-to-video film . if you like ice-t and wan na see one of his more recent films , save your money and rent or buy `` out kold '' .
this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth . as some readers have complained , this is not really a `` christian '' book because the focus is n't on christ , it 's on you . a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally , the way jesus would , and not on trying to `` find the perfect spouse . '' the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike : making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you . it 's rather selfish , really , when you consider the words of john the baptist : `` christ must become more , i must become less , '' as well as the warning in song of solomon `` do not awaken love until it so desires . '' should n't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires ? finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines . hearts can be broken , and therefore authentic , christlike love must take precedence . i do n't mean to sound accusing , but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls `` seduction . '' my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a `` poser . '' this happens when 'forcing yourself ' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex . you have to ask : what kind of people are you trying to attract ... people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are ? i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality . it is a combination of both action and faith that is important . faith to set the situations up . action to knock em down
although i love the firm , this one is not my favorite.it is a good workout , there is just something about it ... it drags.perhaps ms delrio is not quite as toned as one would hope .. i do n't know.at one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.i have dozens of firms and some with this instructor , that i like.it seems that most firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it , but this one falls short in some indescribable way
i have read in another review that the `` john wayne collection '' edition of this dvd is of poor picture quality . i have the `` collector 's eddition '' , and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well . this is a great movie , a classic . it was filmed beautifully in ireland and deserves better then this . i hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves
musty , dated , old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers . this stuff was n't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it . i like mr.asimov , and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery ( maybe ) . all in all , read benchley or woody allen again for literary laughs and leave asimov for the <NUM> other genres he dabbled in
i have listened to this cd , also watched the dvd , of john fogerty 's long road home on amazon . nothing can compare to his dvd of premonition.i own it love it , put it on and makes me rock out , with one of the best entertainers in his prime time of life.the guitars and instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.his voice is so excellent & clear.had some friends over with john 's premonition dvd playing.it took all of us back to that time in history.they all went to amazon and bought premonition.i know soon they will all be gone.i went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.as i consider premonition to be a collector 's dvd.if you see it again.do not wait buy it while they are available . i know its a import as most dvds are today.mine plays excellent in audio and picture.you feel like you are sitting in the audience with john performing.give premonition <NUM> stars.anything after john 's premonition dvd can not compare to it.no matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a cd or a dvd.premonition is the best dvd of all of times . all the rest get <NUM> star for trying . though not coming close to what i call my collector 's edition dvd of john fogerty 's prmonition .
this is the longest textbook i have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that . i know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations , but the book was too detailed and wordy for me . many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding . but this book does n't do that . it is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise , straightforward text . a really good book is investment science , by david luenberger . although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory , the writing , examples , and organization is far superior . you 'll actually begin to understand how investment really works , without getting bogged down by the numbers , terminology , and jargon
i loved `` the rm '' and expected the same level out of this movie , but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest . the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene . they also loved `` the rm '' . if you can get it from the library go ahead , but do n't spend money on it
not terrible , but i do n't get the hype . to me , it 's just new wave disco-and disco was bad in the <NUM> 's . finally , what 's this doing in a `` power pop '' category ? no freaking way is this remotely power pop ! what a disgrace to power pop lovers
i hate to rain on everybody 's parade , but i found this book to be a rehash of stuff i 've read over and over in other places . there 's too many numbers in here . what people need is an attitude about money , not just & quot ; save so much money for so long at <NUM> % interest per year and you 'll have so much saved for retirement at <NUM> , but if you wait until you 're <NUM> to start , you 'll only have this much saved .... & quot ; ( that 's not a quote from the book , but you can place that quote in almost any financial book , and it will fit just fine ) . personally , i thought the millionaire next door was better and rich dad poor dad in a leauge of its own . any book on this subject will certainly convey & quot ; some & quot ; information . the problem is that they are too number oriented . people need to focus on paying themselves first regularly , having a set savings program and intelligent investments . this book seems to be more focused on getting rich by retirement . that 's just great , but anybody who saves money over 40+ years darn well better be rich by retirement or they do n't know what they are doing . on the other hand , i think the authors are realistic in the sense that this is not get rich quick by any means . if you want to sum it all up , no matter who you are or what your circumstances are , save money on a regular and consistent basis , cut up all of your credit cards , pay cash for everything , keep your wants and spending under control and that 's about it really . it 's not that hard to get rich . i just wish the book had more practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers and statistics
a run-of-the-mill hired gun oater told from the hired gun 's point of view . yul brynner stars in invitation to a gunfighter , a western with a conscience from <NUM> , a bad time for westerns made in the lower <NUM> . brynner plays jules gaspard d'estaing ( jewel , for short , ) a silk-shirted top-notch gun for hire who 's enlisted by a small southwestern town to shoot george segal , a young man returning from the civil war who , much to town owner and chief psychopath pat hingle 's horror and disgust , fought for the confederacy . segal returns to town bereft of farm , stolen -- - er , claimed and sold by hingle while he was gone - and sweetheart janice rule , a new england lass who married a one-armed piano player out of pity . after segal tries to take back his farm , rather forcefully and impulsively , hingle 's hatred for all things southern boils over and he hires one of the best guns in the lawless west . at some point in the movie brynner 's character observes that this cowed frontier town is filled with hens ( civil war widows ) and capons ( injured vets of that war . ) it can be ruled by anyone with enough moxie to take it over , and hence we 're given the reason why hingle 's character is named brewster - well , it rhymes with rooster , anyway , and his penchant for quoting and paraphrasing passages from the bible is hollywood 's shorthand way of telling us he 's either a fraud or criminally demented . in any event , the slave system segal may ( underline and italicize the word ` may ' ) have been fighting to protect and defend is clumsily contrasted with the hingle-led town 's treatment of women and resident mexicans . neither can vote in town councils , the mexicans ca n't buy ammunition to kill game to feed their families , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . which reminds me , brynner ai n't half-bad as the suave and conflicted gun slinger . it probably goes without saying that there was only one man , recently returned from the war , who treated the resident mexicans with any respect . that fact does n't escape brynner 's attention , anyway , and it sets up the big conflict - does a hired gun let outside factors interfere with his contract to kill ? invitation to a gunfighter would have been a whole lot better if it had n't tried so hard to prove the town 's moral hypocrisy , if it had n't spent so much time developing a sticky romantic quadrangle between rule , brynner , segal , and the one-armed man , and especially if it had n't loaded a simple story with so much ` message . ' westerns , and action movies in general , work best when the connection between motivation and action is simple and direct . in itag that connection is hopelessly , and needlessly , tangled . brynner has a lithe intensity that rises above the material and almost , but not quite , carries this movie along with him .
i 've read all of nevada barr 's anna pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until i reached hard truth . after writing so many intellligent , suspenseful stories , barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime . murder 's not nasty enough ? how about the murder of children ? still not gruesome enough ? add incest/rape/torture ... you get the picture . ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains , but really , who cares ? the kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal . it 's like bad language in humor -- in general , it 's just a cover for bad writing . in hard truth , barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness , in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable : the charm and intelligence of her main charcter , the well-reasoned defense of nature , the lush descriptions of each story 's setting . i found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable . i give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character ( a recently paralyzed ice climber ) , but otherwise i 'm sorry i spent my time and money on it
if you want to find out about evel knievel avoid this garbage . i do n't own it but i saw most of it on tv and was appalled . george eads was not too bad a choice but they could have found someone better . and what 's with the peeing scenes ? what kind of a statement were they trying to make ? ? ? ? i never did see the ending of it ... it was that lousy . it 's a complete disaster . someone needs to do a big motion picture about evel knievel like they did about muhammed ali . the best actor i can think of is matthew mcconaughey as evel .
who 's idea was it to have victor garber as daddy warbucks ? okay he is a good actor , but once they had shaved his head , did they not see how freakishly enormal it was ? or the shine ? the original annie was awesome , it was perfect , it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.the new annie doesnt even fit the bill , no red curly hair , which wasnt the original movies idea , it was based on the cartoon . my niece saw this one first , and then the original , and she loves the original even though she saw it second , she said the new one isnt `` as fun to watch '' and i agree
this was n't the worst movie i have ever seen , but it left me just feeling sad that i spent money to buy it . the characters are predictable , the plot is predictable .. well , i should have seen it coming . however , there are a couple of funny moments . that 's why i give this movie one star
yes , this is the great pbbb 's 3rd album , but it 's not the cd you should be buying . this domestic cd was released in <NUM> and has never been remastered . the import 2cd version of this title ( backed with the pbbb 's 4th `` in my own dream '' ) is the one to get . it was remastered in <NUM> . ditto for `` the paul butterfield blues band '' & `` east west '' ; the <NUM> import 2cd is also remastered ( and sounds incredible ) and the domestic cd 's are not . why wea and elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery . do n't waste your money on these inferior versions : get the imports
this book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history , with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot -- but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad . i listened to about half this book on tape , but found i just could not bear another minute of it . it was stilted , repetitive , and trite . the language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing . some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c , but i do n't believe anyone in history would 've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech ; if so , such conversations are best forgotten . i love mysteries and historical fiction , but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read .
these guys without max suck bad fire derrick green and bring back max cavalera
i 'm really tired of the shoddy dvd manufacturing used by many studios and distributors . this is a great film . i have it on tape . i was thrilled to see it 'd been released on dvd . i love italian knock-offs of american films ( street law seems inspired by death wish ) , and i 'm a barbara bach fan . so i bought this street law dvd brand new , as soon as amazon offered it , without waiting for the price to go down . i unwrap the pristine-looking dvdm pop it into the player , and after a few minutes it pauses . then it pauses again . it pauses constantly throughout the film . i mean at least once a minute , often several times a minute . pause , pause , pause . most of the pauses are brief , some last several seconds . i eventually took out the dvd , cleaned it , but it did n't help . i suffered through <NUM> minutes of this film , then gave up . vhs was a decent format . tape had problems , but nowhere near as bad as dvd , with all the skipping and scratching . ( and google `` dvd rot '' -- see what comes up . ) still , changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we 'd already bought , so i guess it makes sense for them . i do n't know whether i got a bad copy of street law , or if this dvd is part of a bad batch , or how widespread the problem is . but beware
i 'm a sucker for anything christmas . i generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year , but come christmas-time , i lap up these sappy movies . but even i could n't stomach this one . the screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time i was watching it i wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a christmas movie could be written and shot in <NUM> days that suckers like me would buy . what a waste of money & time
absolutely unwatchable . cliche-ridden . so silly it 's very nearly offensive . it 's like watching one long music video by a b-level rapper - full of dumb , beautiful women , buff , monkey-headed ghetto thugs , and jokey tricked-out cars . without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . the script is laughable , the acting worse . vin diesel and paul walker are more `` dumb and dumber '' than `` butch cassidy and the sundance kid '' . awful
funk is that kinda vibe you eat hotwings and groove at fish fries funk is when you come out of church 's chicken jamming , sorry but half this cd is not funk , d train is bubblegum pop , gap band outstanding is not funky enough , but hits , why is queen on here they was not a funk group , the whispers no way hose , carl carlton 's she 's a bad mama jama is not a funk classic , i always said these funk compilations does the artists injustice , if you wan na learn what funk is check out the original recordings well i 'll list a few , the entire catalog , and entourage of james brown , parliament-funkadelic , sly stone , larry graham , bootsy collins , barkays , ohio players , chaka khan and rufus , cameo , curtis mayfield , mandrill , earth , wind fire , war , the list is endless
i do n't feel that miller made much of an attempt to prove that anna was in fact a `` good '' mother . like another reviewer said , i do n't think she was a bad mother , but the book really did n't go into much detail about anna 's relationship with molly ( especially up until anna ' ex-husband filed for custody ) and instead focused on anna 's life experiences and psyche . after brian said he would n't send molly back , anna did n't even seem that concerned about molly 's mental and emotional well-being . she just focused on her notion that leo 's actions were simply taken out of context , and while she wanted to see molly again , i got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her `` rights '' as a mother , not out of a concern for her daughter . and what was so great about leo anyway ? ? he was n't exactly nice to anna , often condescending to her , and from the beginning i felt that his affection for molly was a farse , simply to stay on anna 's good side . he also seemed sexually possessive of anna -- like the scene when he kept having sex with her after molly came into the bed because of a nightmare . i think anna loved her daughter , but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love , since she had never felt such an attraction before . as a result , her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for <NUM> months , with dire consequences . although she did show some signs of remorse , she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter 's welfare . if she had put her daughter first from the beginning , instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new `` family '' she and leo were forming , then she probably never would have lost custody of her child .
well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book written on <NUM> , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so
this book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss . although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief , it does not offer solutions . shakesphere and poe may have had similar experiences , and may have written about them elloquently , but that does n't help me today . i think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers
the quality of the recording on the audio series is very poor . it distracted from the message . i was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book , but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons . tape <NUM> of <NUM> was a recording of someone besides tommy tenney
despite attempts to keep an open mind , i grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions , exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book . the author calls cuba - a country under a dictator which holds no elections - a & quot ; democracy & quot ; and extols the virtues of the revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated against those who opposed the revolution . it is a shame that a work which could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a propaganda pamphlet
hi . actually i did n't buy this movie , i watched it on nickelodeon . and it 's sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring . i almost fell asleep just watching it . i ca n't believe i used to like these dolls . i bought a mall maniac madison doll a few months ago , now i 'm thinking about selling it on ebay . bratz are much better , and prettier . i mean , have you seen the my scene bling bling dolls ? u-g-l-y . alot of people say bratz dress like sluts , but they do n't . my scene dolls are the ones who wear halter tops and mini skirts almost showing their * ss . i have n't watched the bratz movies , but i 'm sure there much better than these . do n't buy this . please . br @ tz girl p.s.- sorry to any girls who like my scene dolls . it 's just my opinion . please do n't be mad
troy why did you put your name on this . this cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it . i am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed , by the way the group was better with conrad the colonel ( ehhhh hehhh ! i am dsgb !
i love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown . with the exeption of `` liberate '' its the same tune from begining to end . not great . i love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic
this is horrendous movie . i will never claim it as the movie of my generation . it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the `` <NUM> 's '' . the others are : breakdancing , the yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women with manly handshakes , new wave music , and junk movies like this . i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself , and what he can get out of life . he ridicules his friend because he 's sick , and does n't feel like driving ferris around ... especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage , so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for `` it was a good day '' . i do n't care what decade it was , or what was cool back then , or now manipulating your friends is `` not '' i repeat '' not '' cool . i know with john and johnette q . public this is something of a sexual relase . i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie , and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny .
robert allen is one of the many real estate `` gurus '' in the world who probably makes more money selling you the `` secrets '' to real estate then actually practicing his own advice . i have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it . i am guessing those who love his stuff have n't actually tried to do it . the book has a lot of wealth building ideas , but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully , which is not the typical reader of his books . he is looking for the person who needs to find the `` magic bullet '' for easy wealth and success , but unfortunately you wo n't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book . what you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work , money , and experience you actually need to be successful . he spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing , which is where he got his start , but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard , takes a lot of time , and requires experience . you will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales , marketing , construction , and general business . some of the actual investing ideas are ok , but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work , which will exclude a lof of people . he also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while i know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information . overall his ideas are average , but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work . if you can take any of one of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work , knowledge learned , and experience you must earn . it will not be as easy as mr. allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests . if you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you wo n't get much more from it .
the content of this book is adequate , but the layout leaves much to be desired . the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents . pages are not labeled with chapter information , such as which chapter that page belongs to . the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half . this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book . you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused . if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book , i would rate it much higher
i 'm a very spiritual person and i was expecting this cd to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life . unfortunately , for me at least , the cd is rather boring and not very inspirational . i 'm about <NUM> minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it . fortunately i have a christian radio station that does a lot more for me .
although the historical parts of this book are great , these moments are few and far between . it seemed to me that this entire work was solely the author 's attempt to justify why she did not have children . instead of standing up for her decision she makes it well known throughout the book that she missed her chance ( s ) to procreate . this book is most likely for women who fall into that catagory and not for the determined childfree
not that attention-holding . plot seemed to drag on too long before coming together , as best it could . realism just never made it . disappointing .
if you do n't understand russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you . the dvd quality is perfect ( i 'm not gon na say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here ) . but the fact that amazon said it is russian but it turned out to be chezh made me sad .
this book led me down the road of jesus ' death and i thought it could have done a better job . it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring
vanishing voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones , and the methods of language death . this is all pretty much common knowledge . however , the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to why language death is something with which we should be concerned . the only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy , which says that biological diversity is good and stable , therefore , linguistic diversity must . however , they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages . they also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity , but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas . the violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science . i would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with `` saving cultures '' or with yet another critique of the west
bad boy did a horrible job with this album . there are some good songs ( maybe 2-3 ) , but over all this album is wack
this is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons . first , there 's the logistical problems . so much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband , both punk fanatics , wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was . second is the truly unforgivable part and that 's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events . i understand if you ca n't cover everyone , of course you ca n't , but they left out more than they included . really disappointing ... i doubt i 'll ever want to watch it again
in this book popper presents two contradictory theses : ( a ) science can be based on deductive logic only , and there is no need for induction ; ( b ) science can not have a logical basis . because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge , as bertrand russell clearly stated , popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science . he talks about replacing `` inductivism '' by `` deductivism . '' in reality , he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory : consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts , which is something known by many . induction , on the other hand , is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests ( a ) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation , and ( b ) also to some phenomena that can not be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis , or hypotheses , that are produced inductively . when popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism , he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results . but in the rest of the book , popper concentrates on the generalization of test results , which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with , as explained above . consequently , popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge can not be produced using deductive logic , which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier . the truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction . induction does not yield logically sure knowledge , but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction . thus , everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction . someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely . similarly , when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work , he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds . popper 's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only , but in fact , they shed doubt mostly on theories , because a theory is not deduced from anywhere , unlike empirical knowledge is , about some singular phenomena . a theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction , as necessary , at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge . popper 's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth . read also my evaluation of kuhn 's views . another erroneous idea of popper is that theories can be falsified but can not be verified . it is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test , there is usually no more wish to keep testing it . but when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon , it is not discarded as invalid . its use continues where it gives good results . it is also true that a theory can not be verified in an absolute sense , but this is true also about empirical knowledge . the generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution , as mentioned . the verification of a theory , or any knowledge , means that it can be used where it gives useful results . unfortunately , the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed , tested , and used .
ok , i bought this cd and it gets <NUM> stars one each for the songs `` believe '' and `` i 'm building bridges '' . the other songs are horrible . ronnie is the lead vocalist for a very good reason ! they were very smart to get vince gill ( the best ! ) to do background vocals on bridge 's . save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale !
like many people , i bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie , amadeus , and the truth . i am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions . the effort and research in this book is excellent but , unfortunately , it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which i 'm not particularly interested in . it may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer . how do you get deep , deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago ? i 'm sure some of solomon 's conclusions are valid but i kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book i had left to go so i could say i finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable
i was very disapointed . the reason manuel is <NUM> times better . i went back reading reason 2.5 power by michael prager. gon na buy his version of 3.0.should have done it in the first place
crying of lot <NUM> flat - senseless - one dead accumulation of words - in , fact this book is , at times , so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders . a book worthy of burning . has writing become a whim of the well read , a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness poor plot poor writing read - umberto eco 's foucaults pendulum . if you are looking for conspiracy . do not read this book ( unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth )
asides from an extremely anti-sinclair slant , this book does adequately handle rosslyn 's architecture and some of its cultural importance .
it is bad ! as much as i like `` <NUM> new songs '' , this one disappointed me a lot .
i 've watched most of segal 's films , and i own several as well . but this film is one of the worst films i 've seen in the last ten years . excepting for a chance to look at jacqueline lord ( a catherine zeta jones look , act , and dress alike ) for a little while , and her acting was n't very good most of the time , there are no redeeming aspects to this film . for a film in the action genre , it consists of all bad elements . the plot actually had potential , except the dialog is on the level of a bad high school film . segal is so over-weight that you can tell he 's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences . unless he can lose weight and get into shape , this is the last film of his i 'll spend any time watching . unfortunately , the sets , the action , the dialog , the acting , the directing , and so forth , are all between the d+ to c levels of quality . i 'd rather have seen a corny kung fu movie . at least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film . avoid this film totally
come on , folks - it 's $ <NUM> for a reason . i was so bored i almost cried . why did n't they take the money they wasted on a horrible film like this and go feed an african city for a day
predator is the worst book i have read in <NUM> months ( i read a lot of books ) . it is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events . the characters are poorly drawn ( i hardly recognized the scarpetta and marino of earlier books ) . the transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak , leaving me feeling : `` huh ? ? '' this the fourth ( and it will be the last ) book by cornwell that i have read . it was totally disappointing and i spent extra time on it just so i could complete it and `` forget about it ''
this movie was terrible .... i went into the theater skepical because i heard that the screenwriters were untested ... well , this disastorpiece is what you get as a result . the movie did so poorly that it bankrupted square pictures . the dialouge was filled with one liners , wasted several talented actors like donald sutherland . the drama seemed artificial , and the story was just bad . what i did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by pixar ( monsters inc .... which was actually far better than this ) this movie is just bad .... avoid it ... i want to see them make a movie out of final fantasy <NUM> , which was the best of the series in my opinio
my church has been using this cd , and many people have been raving about it , but i feel that the reviews are unjustified . to me the cd promotes an experiential feeling of worship , where it is the music and the experience of the cd that is creating a 'feeling ' of god 's presence - many of the previous reviews appear to be alluding to such a thing . because the songs are conference songs the songs stick to adoration-type songs only ( ie . songs expressing the greatness of god ) - and there are n't really any songs which give their * focus * to expressing what god has done for us , or songs of confession , or songs of supplication , or songs by which we can encourage one another . the theology is very one-sided and i think for this reason very unhelpful - compare , say , to having a service where all you prayed for was to praise god for how great he is - while it 's a very important thing , it 's not the only thing - you are missing out on something and that 's what i think this cd does . the other problem i have is that the arrangements are just too high - sure , the singers on there can sing them , but anyone with an average voice range ( especially males ) will have some trouble hitting some of the notes in this . `` indescribable '' hits a top f - not great for congregational singing . there are some much better cds out there with good christian songs - i 'd skip this one and try something else
a hopeless mess of headlines and confusing comments , very little structure . no rankings of what you should see and do , no pictures , no useful restaurant and hotel recommendations . endless yatter about nothing makes this a boring read with almost no real content . absolutely worthless on our japan trip to tokyo and kyoto . this is not the first time we have been disappointed by lonely planet . they cater to backpackers only , usually looking for the cheapest accomodation and meals , and with no value added for the traveller who is short on time but still wants to make the most out of his/her time . we ended up buying the eyewitness guoide which is fast and easy to use .
thsi book is for someone who has an extense knowledge of the byzantine empire . i do not posses such knowledge and got lost inmediatly while trying to read this book . the author 's style adapts for someone who knows all the history of the people involved in this empire already . i could n't even finish the first chapter because i found myself asking : who is he talking about ? every two lines
this is a beautiful but creepy book : a lost sheep all alone , terrified by ufos no less into fleeing into a strange , deserted home , is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child . the strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel , but they are also ominous and deterring . his utter solitude , in exploring the house ( creepy corridor with blood-colored doors ) , eating , and finally sleeping , is horrifying to a child with imagination , whose most overriding terror is abandonment . i give it points for beauty and originality , none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience , and can not recommend it
this is your standard , generic , run-of-the mill comedy , with ben stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc . and jennifer anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible . stiller marries some woman , they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon , he catches her having sex with some guy , and he goes back to new york depressed . then he meets polly , and they have absolutely nothing in common . they go through the usual problems ( yawn ) , then at the end they sort of get together , i guess . if you 'll laugh at absolutely anything , i mean , if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious , then you may find this amusing . truthfully , it 's a lousy , unfunny script , these people have absolutely no comedic sense , and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat . there 's nothing worse than watching a movie where you 're sitting there thinking , `` oh , that was supposed to be funny '' , and not laughing . do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor , even though he obviously did n't slip or anything ? do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really , really thick accent so you can barely understand him ? are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them , and they act like a complete loon ? i mean , come on . this crap was old when they were doing it on the carol burnett show <NUM> years ago . anyhow , if you 're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight , brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time , then you 'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else . it 's probably better than reruns on the cooking channel , but only by the slimmest of margins
this my first review on amazon but i was compelled to write based on my experience with this course . the first cd is fantastic . it starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson . within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work i had mastered all the lessons on the cd and could easily translate the english phrases in the final review lesson into italian . i was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine . my opinion is that most people write their review based on the first cd . and then i put in the second cd . i thought there was some mistake , as if i had switched to a completely different italian course . the slow , clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking italians who did n't repeat anything , and certainly did n't give you time to repeat in the pause . the assumption appeared to be that i already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course . within ten minutes i knew this was no longer the course for me . i listened to the entire second cd just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn italian . no such luck ! i have gone back to using the first cd for practice while i wait for the pimsleur italian course to arrive
as a fan of buth and his song contributions to the flatlanders , i was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle , strident polemics against war or the obstacles to peace . the melodies were not memorable . it is in sharp contrast to neil youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic .
this is a complete waste of time . there is virtually no plot , the whole point of the movie is the celebrity cameos
this work was recorded at eastern sound in toronto under the worst of creative conditions , produced by vinnie testa who 's only claim to fame was supposedly being aquainted with shadow morton who produced the fudge.the album was released on mgm lion and followed the release of the single lost son which was a london parrot single . now the facts : earth omen , new horizon and lost son were in truth composed as a trilogy by jon wearing who had been working with another michigan artist and associate dick wagner after the demise of the frost.wagner went on to form ursa major and wearing who had been working in the detroit music scene since <NUM> with the tidalwaves and had a hit farmer john signed with pink with the agreement for the first work <NUM> % of his writing would be distributed equally among the other members of the band who were totally lost and down and out . testa and wearing could never see eye to eye , the management had no idea what they were doing , irs and legal issues and the entire project was a wash and wearing left to form a very good r & b influenced rock band called deluxe . deluxe toured with joe walsh , james cotton , atlanta rhythm section , opened for seger and many others.dallas hodge , ray craig , kimballlee , greg caulder and wearing comprised the band that had been targeted by epic to sign . leo fenn part of the alice cooper business organization and wearing pal was the manager until heads got out of control in part do to johnny winter 's medling and then john sinclair became the manager and demise of this fine act . hodge continues to work with canned heat overseas and wearing still provides moments with the detroit based ghostband.wearing attempted to provide some quality to pink however was stiffled by the mis-management of clyde stevers and marv wilson . enough for now , the truth
in let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth , justice , and the american way . just the title represents everything true and good about him and america . for his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and hannity 's words are the validation of those beliefs . if this was written by a ghost writer , he should have withheld payment . if it was n't written by a ghostwriter , hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole . the first chapter is written in a maudlin , `` those-were-the-good-old-days '' wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity , and a believer in the american dream . but before you can say `` erin go braugh '' he is talking about the courage of george w. bush for standing up to terrorism . exactly how g.w . does , he does n't elaborate . how he goes from grandfather to dubbya is a bit of magic . hannity 's next trick is to impugn clinton and gore as being soft on terrorism . his source for this is , of all people , dick morris who knew the clintons and now works for the fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements as `` it seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism , '' or `` they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism . '' these `` morris mind-reads '' are conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he does with impunity . let 's take a closer look at hannity 's unimpeachable source for a moment . it was dick morris who quit the clintons shortly after the second election . it was morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers , did some jail time , and entered alcohol rehab . you 'd think sh could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring ! but , hannity does n't skip a beat . he points out how democrats such as senators kerry and daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills , or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills , or the many defense bills that kerry and daschle did vote for . he never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by dick cheney when he was secretary of defense . such deception is called propaganda . propaganda is something that hannity has no compunction using here . this he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked . namely , it is the story of president clinton being offered osama bin laden by the sudanese government . again , it 's what he does n't say that misdirects the reader . sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading , lifted . however , the fbi determined that the sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin laden . the sudanese also made the offer to saudi arabia , but the saudis had revoked bin laden 's citizenship , and refused to take him . benjamin franklin said `` statistics is a liar . '' hannity uses charts for the same purpose . he shows how under reagan , the army bought over <NUM> tanks . under clinton , the army bought none . this leads one to the assumption that clinton did nothing for the services . he does n't mention that the army buys tanks , not presidents . he does n't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the soviet union that never came . he does n't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . be grateful that hannity can not rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history . if he could , instead of seeing a dead captain ahab being killed by the whale in `` moby dick , '' we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption : `` i caught a fish this big ! '' there 's something very fishy about his facts , his historical parallels which are n't parallel , and what he chooses to tell you , and what he chooses to leave out . in this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !
something that someone who claims to be country should not do . even though these girls are already pop , remixing it to make it even more pop was a huge mistake ! then again , they have to do something to sell more cd 's ! lol ! !
ahhh , the long awaited scott stapp solo album . the resurgence of scott stapp begs the immediate question -- is there anything scott stapp ca n't do ? the answer is invariably yes : sing , write decent songs , or stay out of jail . lets start with the album cover and the goofy aramaic looking symbol behind him . when loosely translated , the writing reads the phrase `` i 'm a tool . '' though i 'll have to give him credit , i was expecting the album cover to be a picture of him nailed to a cross . instead he went with a tastful picture of himself dressed like a biker and posing like he 's being voilated by a [ ... ] thermometer . for all those folks out there looking for that `` inspiration '' they all seem to find in stapp 's lyrics , i suggest you get some inspiration from the business end of a lousiville slugger . maybe then you wo n't reach out to the psuedo-christian rocker that got arrested on his wedding day . and i do n't even have to mention the video of him and kid rock having sex with groupies .
i actually quite enjoyed this book until the last few pages . the individual stories of the pilgrims are relatively interesting ( if a bit clumsy ) , all having some connection with hyperion . progress towards the story 's climax on hyperion seemed slow , but i assumed there would be some kind of closure to the story , which would also lead on to the next book in the series . sadly , there is no closure to the story , leaving me feeling cheated . most authors are able to find a good balance between providing a satisfactory ending to one story , and leaving you keen for the next one . most annoying of all , the author completely pulled me out of his fictional world by dropping in a trite and annoying reference to 20th century fiction at the very end . i felt like the joke was on me , the author was deliberately trying to disrupt my suspension of disbelief . i 'm disappointed , i feel betrayed by the cheap ending , and i sha n't bother reading any further in the series .
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for . the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality . this must have been taken from a 16mm print . it may be that this film is in public domain , so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd . there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues . note : amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of `` meet john doe '' . the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this : [ ...
just listening to the samples of this new remix of `` gold:35th anniversary edition ~ the carpenters '' i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly . certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well . i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs ? as another review noticed and i agree with , is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice . this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters . the older cds ( if still in production or if you can find them used ) `` carpenters classics 25th anniversary '' a <NUM> cd disc 98:04 minute collection remastered digitally , is a much better pick . especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with . the other cd 's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen 's deep resounding perfect voice , would be the cd `` voice of the heart '' this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song . the other one i would highly recommend , if christmas is your holiday , would be `` carpenters christmas portrait '' ... `` special edition digital version .... celebrating <NUM> continuious minutes of the seasons best ... '' with karen and richard . there are <NUM> carpenters songs as timeless as their sound , and <NUM> performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time . these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing . these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard . this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter 's recorded and later remastered-not remixed- sounded . for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a <NUM> star rating . these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans , took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song . talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver . as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying `` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ! '' or in this case do n't remix it !
despite what the book title `` grammatically correct '' , this book is mostly about punctuation usages . grammar is limited to a thin , single chapter . there are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages , let alone correct them . i would recommend `` painless grammar '' over this title
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must `` ... forgive god '' and that we must love god `` ... even if he isnt perfect '' . kusher even has the will to say that `` ... god would not be god ... '' without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said `` ... let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that `` ... god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place. `` for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god ... '' the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped <NUM> million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question `` why ''
and simple math answers too . for example , ( 1/2 ) ( 2/3 ) = ? they say it 's 1/6 . i 'm of the opinion that it 's actually 1/3 . that 's just one of several i 've ran across . still , it 's better than nothing , but i think looking at your old college textbooks and doing the ets questions is probably a better route
liz hurley has her top off <NUM> or <NUM> times ; there is incest , lesbian love between sisters-in-law , the main character 's husband is having an affair with his brother 's girlfriend who really is n't his brother 's girlfriend , she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother 's girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a `` solved incorrectly '' murder from <NUM> years ago on an island with some norwegian people . and honest to god the movie is boring . sean penn broods , leers , pains , and smokes cigarettes , his wife is played by catherine mccormack who is like a young charolette rampling , very watchable but condemned to a weak role ; liz hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off ( unforgettable ) : all this and the movie drags , and drags . liz stops taking her top off at the 1/3 mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is . the parallel stories just do n't come off . actually it is a one star movie , liz taking her top off boots it one extra star
i have to admit , like others , i bought this cd just because i was excited to have another collection of three dog night songs . i was so disappointed when i played it and realized it was really only two dogs . without chuck , there is no three dog night . they can package it the same way , call it by the same name , but it 's not . these vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals , certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love . i agree with another reviewer here ... why ca n't they listen to the words of `` easy to be hard '' and patch things up ? if the eagles can do it , the dogs should be able to as well . eager fans are waiting for some new harmony ! oh yeah , and this cd , i threw it away
i bought this book based on its 5-star rating and feel i wasted my money . that 's how i really feel , authentically . i have read other works positing a connection between physical symptoms/illnesses and life trauma ; the idea is not unique or new . alice miller is fixated on the idea that the fouth commandment ( honor thy parents ) has poisoned lives and ruined society and restates this theory every page or two . this notion is so compelling to her that she actually went to the vatican to complain . ms. miller gives anecdotal information about famous people who died young and then leaps to the conclusion that their parents were mean to them . maybe they were -- but what are we supposed to do with this information ? find a therapist who is willing to become emotionally involved with us seems to be the cure . this medicine carries its own risks . i 'm sorry alice was also raised by abusers ( which she confesses ) but getting tangled up in some codependent parent-figure therapeutic emotional incest with her or someone like her is not really going to help anybody . realizing what happened to you is important , and raging and grieving about it is important , but sooner or later you have to move on . forgiving is n't forgetting or letting the abuser off the hook -- it 's letting you off the hook , refusing to be owned by the past anymore . and yes , you can love and hate somebody at the same time . it gets down to knowing you ca n't get what you needed from them or any other person in your adult life ... you have to become the parent of the wounded child within and help that child finish growing up . good luck and god bless ... if you 're needing a book like this for yourself .
the movie has many none-too-subtle * very * anti-christian elements , particularly in the typical hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing `` christian '' tv evangelists and christians themselves as stupid zombies ; life as basically pointless . i am sick of hollywood rubbish like this ! so , if you 're a christian , stand firm -- do n't buy it ! !
the only reason i finished this book was it was a book club pick - i read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit . this book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read . i ca n't believe so many people are giving it a good review . the constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read . do n't bother
a rewiver in a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of bottle rockets and the drive-by truckers . he must be kiddin ` . you ca n't compare apples with oranges . i rather say it sounds like bon jovi were playin somekind of nashville pop-country , like the great divide . some compare this to legends like lynyrd skynyrd and allman bros . they couldnt have been listening to the same record as me ! but if you like shelby lynne and pat greens newer stuff , lend an ear to these guys . but if you want blood , search the real thing in these bands the lost trailers thinks they have something in common with .
i read this book hoping for a clear understanding of buddhism . this book is written very bland . very few pictures too . i find it difficult to read and follow .
this film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes . it is as scientifically realistic as the roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a geico commercial . out of the hundreds of films that i have watched in my lifetime , of every stripe and quality , this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that i began fast-forwarding through simply so that i could see the meteor hit and make the big wave . if this film were a sexual encounter , both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay . life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film .
most upsetting about port of miami is that being a big fan of the organ-filled `` hustlin ' '' , i was hoping that quality-wise the entire album would stand up to that brilliant for single . unfortunate for the somewhat fortunate debut ( # <NUM> on the billboard <NUM> with 187,000 copies sold ) , the album to put it bluntly stinks . sure `` hustlin ' '' along with a generic repeat of young jeezy 's massive `` soul survivor '' hit ( `` cross the line '' which features nobody else by konvikt akon ) , are fine , but otherwise , ross has more inhabitions than attributes . while idealy ross should compete with new standouts such as southern rapper young jeezy or t.i. , or even more less known names such as slim thug or bun b , he does n't make the cut against any of those artist . in fact , ross 's gravely vocals tend to grate rather than inspire , all except on the opening tracks such as the above par `` push it '' , `` hustlin ' '' , `` cross the line '' , or `` i 'm bad '' . otherwise , ross unfortunately falls on death ears . it makes you wonder that if ross were to ever release a sophomore album , would it be successful ? with such boasts made of him by diddy and jay-z , mega hip-hop stars and talent-searchers , you wonder who dropped the ball with the excution of this star 's album , which is terrible to say about any new artist . and without a true single tall enough to stand against the incredible but minor radio cut ( it never did really well despite fan support ) `` hustlin ' '' , you wonder if after an impressive debut and support if the only way for ross is down instead of up ? no , i 'm not putting ross down , but i ca n't help but to say that i was expecting a meatier , grammy worthy debut from ross instead of the rather hit-absent port of miami . does he rep good for miami ? sure , but hopefully a second round will make ross more mature and more likeable than a rather bland debut . <NUM> stars for the album , 4.5 for killer single `` hustlin ' '' , a sure to be rap classic
this is a deplorable piece of work from a sad , talentless hack . with any luck , this will be last time nick hasted is ever asked to write about important figures in music , such as eminem , whom i love . he simply lacks the skill or flair required to tell the story in a pacy , engaging and believable fashion
i was excited when i saw this book with such a title . but it turned out to be one of the worst ( popular math book ) i have read in the last few years . then i read the review by sporkdude on november <NUM> , <NUM> ( thanks sporkdude ! ) . he made some very good suggestions ( that we should ignore all the odd chapters but a handful of pages , if not ignore the whole book at all ) . i gave the book a second chance , but it just once again confirmed that it 's a really badly written book . i can tell you why . on page xiii of the book , the auther claims that `` i do n't believe the riemann hypothesis can be explained using math more elementary than i have used here , so if you do n't understand the hypothesis after finishing my book , you can be pretty sure you will never understand it . '' is it true ? what i am sure is that you will not understand what riemann hypothesis is after finishing this book . the author never tried to get to the point , or i would say he was incapable in doing so . even worse , you would n't be able to grisp a big picture of what the hypothesis was all about , as the author jumped around too much , that you 're not sure what it 's all up for . together with his tedious writing style ( e.g . he likes to throw you with some random decimal numbers upto a hundred digits ) , it wo n't take you too long to realize it 's just a waste of time to keep on reading this book . it is `` amazing '' that such a book would get an average of 4.5 stars by <NUM> reviewers . if it was your very first popular math book and you found it delightful , i can assure you that there 're some a lot better popular math books out there waiting for you to explore
indecent proposal 's intriguing premise starts off with a provocative question : `` what would you do if i offered you a million dollars to spend the night with your wife ? '' in its attempt to explore sexuality , morals and ethics in america , the movie 's writers , producers , and director are too afraid of the controversial subject matter to provide a clear answer to the question it asks the audience . instead of being thought provoking film , the movie deteriorates into another predictable by the numbers forgettable commercial hollywood drama . if the studios gave me million dollars i could make a better film than this . indecent proposal follows a struggling california married couple drowning $ 50,000 in debt . out of work and desperate for cash , they go on a trip to vegas . browsing in a hotel store , diana runs into a billionaire john gage who has eyes on her . he offers to buy her a $ <NUM> dress she has eyes on . diana says she ca n't be bought . gage sees a challenge . shawn sees a predictable plot twist . thinking nothing of her encounter she returns to the gambling tables with her husband . after winning $ 25,000 , halfway towards their goal , the couple heads back to their room planning to gamble more unaware of how hollywood casinos operate . predictably they lose all their winnings . both run into gage who asks diana to go to his table for luck . gage plays a high stakes game betting a million dollars on a crap table . after winning his high stakes bet , gage asks the couple to join him in his suite . there he proposes his indecent proposal : a night with the wife in exchange for a million dollars . the cash-strapped couple declines , but ponders taking him up on his offer on the way back to the hotel room . set your watch for what happens next . soon after the proposal the movie falls apart . gage buys her the expensive dress sweetens the pot . upon getting the dress the couple decides takes up gage on his offer . with his wife on the way , woody hangs out with a lawyer buddy . soon after talking to him , harrelson 's character gets second thoughts . he races for the roof to cancel the deal but is too late to stop the helicopter . how predictable . on the boat we watch diana getting ready . she and gage meet up and have dinner and drinks . we do n't know if they have relations ; the movie leaves that as a mystery . diana and her husband return to california to pay their debts . they soon find out john gage has bought out their mortgage . things start to get ridiculous from here . the manipulative gage only bought the house as part of a tactic to possess diana . he goes to her real estate job and tries to court her . i guess one night of her good stuff was n't good enough for her . harrelson 's character starts to become insecure , wanting graphic details of the encounter . his jealousies cause him to act irrational and angry like every other movie husband . feeling stressed out , diana leaves her husband for the super rich gage . yawn . losing his woman , harrelson takes a teaching job and starts working on his future . getting the divorce papers , he goes to an auction for animals . there he spends the one million dollars on a hippo to prove how much he loves her . he signs the divorce papers and she goes off with her billionaire man . he gets a change of heart when he realizes she still loves him . yawn . later in the car , gage and his driver talk about how they 've played this game over a dozen times . diana requests he stop the car . they break up and she gets on a bus . later she meets her ex-husband at the pier he proposed to her at and the movie comes to a clunky unsatisfying close . the performances are terrible . the entire cast is uninspired ; no one in this film makes an effort to bring any type of depth to their characters . woody harrelson is horribly miscast . i do n't believe him as an architecture expert . demi moore is wooden in the role of diana . she brings no dimension to the character at all . i feel no tension or stress from her even though she 's playing a woman conflicted by tremendous emotional and moral pressures . robert redford is charming and handsome , as john gage but the character seems like a one-dimensional caricature instead of a human being . look for billy bob thornton in a small role as a tourist . indecent proposal is n't indecent it 's just bland . it does n't take any of the risks in its exploration of its taboo subject matter . aside from some lukewarm sex scenes early on between the married couple , the movie is just another by the numbers hollywood drama pretending to be a thought provoking film . the provocative ideas about sexual morals and ethics advertised in its premise are just a selling point to trick customers into spending money on it . do n't let this movie con you out of your hard earned cash . instead of accepting this mediocre proposal on the video rack , i suggest you pick up summer of '42 , when harry met sally or love story .
how in the world that dave chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery ? ? so now that he choked a <NUM> million dollar pay day away he got smart & knows he does n't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place . this is a insult to wattstaxx . that documentary from <NUM> was important this is just a mess . the music acts on here are lame as well . you want the big acts of today not no milk carton , has-beens or non-hit having acts . the only thing funny about this film is that it got made & was released . glad his corny show is no more . good riddence . this movie is equally bad as well .
i ca n't believe none of the other reviews of the ultra lounge series state that these cd 's contain almost all instrumental music , with very few songs that feature vocals . i expect a lounge music cd to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks , and of the four ultra lounge cd 's i purchased , i count only three songs with vocals on all four of them . while the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music , they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them . the titles of the ultra lounge cd 's ( such as bachelor pad or bossanova ) mean very little , as each cd fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks . the best lounge cd i have heard so far is from an unlikely source . i purchased it at pottery barn , and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs . keep this in mind when buying lounge music cd 's so that you wo n't be disappointed the way i was with the ultra lounge series
this show was supposed to be about letting horror directors compete with each other to see who can come up with the scariest little horror show of the season . it has devolved into a bunch of has-beens using their ready-made audience to condescendingly lecture us with their dime-story philosophy and politics . joe dante 's homecoming , argento 's pelts , and now this .
this review refers to the uncut dvd version . like the other reviewers here , i loved this movie . the movie i would rate as <NUM> stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress juliette marquis ( from ukraine no less ) . the image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video . i can undertand and accept that . this dvd however is a lousy pan and scan version . some movies can be pan and scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future tv transfers in mind . but this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and did n't make room for transfer to fullscreen tv . it is intensely frustrating to watch this damned dvd . you watch noses talking to half faces , half faces talking to ears , heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly . i am furious at the studio a__holes at hart sharp video who sanctioned this pan and scan monstrosity . and they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen . to add insult to injury , they show pictures on the back cover and the insert , of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the pan and scan cropped crap . hart sharp video goes straight to my list of never buy from again . by all means see this movie - at the theater . or wait till a more responsible company releases a new dvd edition
sure , it 's steamy , and the leads are sexy , but we never really get a chance to know or care about them , so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter . in fact it was a little boring . plus , what language are these folks speaking ? i know it 's english , but it might as well be french . the supporting cast is universally nasty , selfish , uninteresting , and unlovable . not much to like here . avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights , of which there are a couple
boring , outdated ex-patriate story of life in paris between the wars , focusing on a young american actress , a psychologist dr. diver and his wife , an american baroness with issues . lots of drinking and gossip
all of the songs on this album are very good , however it does n't live up to standards . sublimes a much better band than this album shows . if your a casual fan , i would not recomoned this to start . instead , i 'd recomend `` <NUM> oz . to freedom '' thats my personal favorite sublime album . it may not have all the hits on it , but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled . great songs , terrible compilatio
if you want to learn isapi programming , getting this book might help little
i 'm a fairly dedicated blur fan , so it seemed that i 'd enjoy this dvd . the only problem was the sound ... which was mostly distorted and sounded like it was `` static-y '' , for lack of a better term . after watching it a few times , i went to the fan site www.blur.co.uk and in the forums found that many others had experienced the same problem . apparently `` starshaped '' was originally realeased on vhs when this footage was first captured in the early <NUM> 's and the vhs version has much better sound , confirming that the sound is n't just `` raw '' , as it is live concert footage . one theory is that the sound was not correctly `` mastered '' when this dvd was produced , hence it is likely a problem on all copies of this dvd . i do have to say that the us version of the video for `` there 's no other way '' was good ( it 's a hidden easter egg - click on the star in the top level menu ) . but i could n't justify spending $ 13-14 for just one music video . i have returned the dvd for a refund
in `` epicenter '' joel rosenberg provides the background information that drives his novels about the middle east and the end times . this nonfiction book will grab readers ' attention due to its analysis of current events through the lenses of politics and economics . however , rosenberg insists that a third lens of biblical prophecy is necessary in order to truly understand what is happening in the middle east today . but is rosenberg 's third lens properly focused ? has he understood ezekiel 's prophecies correctly ? it should first be recognized that rosenberg 's approach to biblical prophecy is nothing new ; he follows the general outline of end time events that have been taught for years by dispensational premillennialists . all the bible scholars that he relies upon fall within that school of prophetic interpretation . they include c.i . scofield , john walvoord , and hal lindsey . he refers to tim lahaye as `` arguably the world 's preeminent prophecy expert '' ( p. <NUM> ) . during the thirty-seven years since my conversion and the twenty-eight years in which i have pastored an evangelical christian church , i have studied both the biblical prophecies and the modern-day prophecy teachers . at the beginning of my christian life i was convinced that the prophecy teachers had the future figured out , but i have learned over time that they are less than reliable . for example , lindsey suggested in `` the late great planet earth '' that christ would return in <NUM> . in the first edition of `` the beginning of the end , '' lahaye said that world war i was the first sign of the end times , but in the <NUM> revision of the book he changed that first sign to the founding of the modern nation of israel in <NUM> . so i approached rosenberg 's book with caution . `` epicenter '' gives the impression that ezekiel <NUM> and <NUM> are easy to understand . rosenberg does not mention that evangelical scholars disagree . peter craigie says , `` the series of prophecies concerning gog . . . are among the most difficult parts of the entire book of ezekiel to interpret . '' even dispensational premillennialists can not agree on when ezekiel <NUM> and <NUM> are going to be fulfilled . will it be before , during , or after the tribulation ? or will it be after the millennium ? advocates for each position can be found . rosenberg also skips over what ezekiel <NUM> meant to ezekiel 's contemporaries . since they were living in exile in babylon when ezekiel delivered his prophecies , would n't they naturally have thought that the divine promise of return to the land referred to them ? but rosenberg does n't even mention that possibility . instead he takes a hermeneutical leap and immediately applies the prophecy to modern israel 's founding in <NUM> . the biggest error comes from rosenberg 's reliance upon a nineteenth century scholar 's teaching that in ezekiel 38:3 `` rosh '' refers to russia ( pp . 85-86 ) . even dispensational premillennialists like charles dyer and ralph alexander reject that interpretation . what about `` meshech '' and `` tubal '' ? in his novels rosenberg readily identifies them as moscow and tobolosk , but in `` epicenter '' he briefly mentions that questions have been raised about those identifications . scholars today understand those terms to be names of tribes that lived in the area of modern-day turkey . why does rosenberg prefer outdated scholarship ? it 's worth noting how the author deals with the other nations mentioned in ezekiel <NUM> . by the amount of emphasis he places on events in persia ( or modern iran ) , he implies that it will be the major ally of russia in its attack on israel . but is that suggestion derived from the text itself , or is that an interpretation rosenberg imposes on the text in light of current events ? ezekiel himself does not highlight persia any more than cush or put . rosenberg points out that egypt is not mentioned in ezekiel <NUM> as an ally of russia ( p. <NUM> ) . that , he suggests , is evidence of ezekiel 's remarkable accuracy since egypt currently has a peace treaty with israel . but in <NUM> hal lindsey identified egypt as a key member of russia 's ally called `` the king of the south '' in daniel <NUM> . how can two prophecy experts come to such contradictory conclusions ? paul boyer observed in his excellent book , `` when time shall be no more . '' `` while the core structure of the premillennial scenario remained remarkably stable for <NUM> years , new events were continually elevated to the status of ` prophetic fulfillments ' or ` end-time signs ' while individuals or events that failed to live up to their expected role were quietly dropped . . . the historian , reading hundreds of prophecy books published over a two-hundred-year period , can readily see this process of inserting current events into an archaic belief system . the average believer , encountering the genre for the first time , may be stunned by the uncanny contemporaneity of the prophecies . '' timothy weber likewise writes in `` living in the shadow of the second coming , '' `` in retrospect , premillennialists had shown more enthusiasm than accuracy in their interpretations . . . their leaders were confident that biblical prophecy was being fulfilled , but events kept forcing them to reevaluate their interpretations of how it was being fulfilled . one is struck by how forgiving and forgetful the premillennialist rank and file must have been during this period . they stuck by their leaders even when they misread the signs of the times . the leaders themselves seemed little deterred by their mistakes . events were changing so quickly that they had little time for apologies . '' while `` epicenter '' may become a bestseller , i 'm afraid that it will eventually prove to be just another prophetic disappointment .
this is the first patterson novel i have ever read , and it is certain to be the last . most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters , but patterson does none of that . the author 's writing style is akin to that of a small child 's , as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters . patterson then holds the reader 's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation , presenting a book written by a ralph wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy . how does the reader know alex was scared ? the reader knows because patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style : `` the man pulled out a gun , alex was scared , alex shot the man and he was happy , and the man was dead . '' do n't believe me ? simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare i had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who i thought he killed , or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist 's evil deeds . quite simply , this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs
this is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie . the main character 's hair is short , then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long , then the next day it is short again . when one person gets buried in the graveyard , it is located downhill by the water . when another person gets buried in the same graveyard , it is up on top of a hill . it is very hard to concentrate on the plot , characters , etc . when this is happening all the time . but two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary
when david rabe 's play `` hurlyburly '' opened on broadway in august <NUM> , it was directed by mike nichols . it ran for <NUM> performances -- a long broadway run -- and was nominated for the tony award for best play . william hurt was nominated for best actor in his role as eddie . judith ivey who recently appeared in the clint eastwood film `` flags of our fathers '' won the tony as featured actress in a play . the rest of the cast included harvey keitel as phil , cynthia nixon as donna , ron silver as mickey , jerry stiller as artie and sigorney weaver as darlene . it 's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen . with lead actors sean penn , kevin spacey & anna paquin , there are four oscars to make this an award-winning cast . perhaps there is a great difference from a mike nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film director anthony drazen who won the filmmaker 's trophy @ sundance for `` dramatic zebrahead . '' whatever the reason , the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void . it is hard to deny that sean penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today . he won the best actor award for this picture @ the venice film festival . as eddie , he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker , snarls , cries & puts his hand in his pants . watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that william hurt 's on broadway . penn is worth watching . he 's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star . kevin spacey as the manipulative mickey is hardly endearing . yes , compared the other guys he seems relatively together . but his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay . it leaves spacey with a mono-level performance that , while interesting , does not move us because he does n't change . chazz palminteri as the gorilla-minded neanderthal phil that ca n't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious . it 's unclear why eddie keeps him around . perhaps to feel that he 's better than someone else , as the dialogue indicates . but we do n't really get that emotional need . thus when phil drives off mulholland , we 're really just glad to be rid of him . i agree that the women are the most likeable . however , we fail to understand why they hang around these guys . robin wright penn 's darlene seems too bright & together to connect with eddie . as the waif donna , anna paquin almost made me forget her rogue character from the x-men movies . she is so vulnerable that i felt sorry for her . as bonnie , meg ryan takes the role that won ivey the tony , but we fail to understand why she is loose . she does n't seem like a girl who 'd have such low standards . the fact that she walks out on eddie seems to confirm this . screenwriter david rabe had worked with penn in two other films , `` state of grace '' & `` casualties of war . '' while penn comes off the best , the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the hollywood hills , but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy . it was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film . i could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed , because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first <NUM> minutes . so while this project may have been wonderful on broadway , the film version nose-dived into oblivion . taxi !
a second season of even more bad writing , cliches all over the place , bell can not act , and silver is a joke of a tv and film producer . just another example of bad marketing and the tv add guys having too much say in how a show is done
orlando bloom tries to act too cute by trying to channel the karma of johnny depp , and it just does not work . kirsten dunst basically just acts cute throughout the whole movie . so , if you like movies about two cute people acting cute , then this movie is for you .
i like several songs on kasabian 's old album but there were also many poor ones . still on this album i dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than club foot , reason is treason , and processed beats . it seems kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process , there is nothing special or creative on this album
who is her editor ? the main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea . we got it . we do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say . i felt , as the reader , that the author did not trust me to `` get '' her own work . it would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit . not to mention , if she grew up in a cold family , with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality , i did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression .
well , it did n't appeal to me personally -the story , the characters , no , usually i am such a big fan of steven spielbergs ' various masterpieces , and despite `` always '' i 'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies , and so well . jaws , close encounters , schindlers ' list , minority report -you name it ! the man is a genious , no argue there -but this movie simply has n't got the touch nor the style
a disappointing rehash of early works on the <NUM> siege of yorktown . half the book deals with the southern campaign of the american revolution . the portion of the book dealing with yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege . for example , the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts <NUM> and <NUM> , which occurred on the night of october 14th . before completing the account of the assaults , he jumps to the sortie by the british on the night of october 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts . a better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is henry p. johnston 's book on the yorktown campaign
it seems extraordinary that a man who claims to write about the sixteenth century has omitted some of the key aspects of the period , such as the crusades and the norman conquest . this oversight is deeply criminal and the book flounders for it
this movie is a hoax . i expect to see a good erotic drama with laura gemser , and i get porn scenes ...
an unreadable book . bits and pieces stretched out over <NUM> pages that never add up to a whole . to use delillo 's garbage theme : it was like finding litter on a sidewalk . each piece once meant something , but who knows what . i finished it because i had read so many good reviews that i thought there must be something worthy in it . sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end . not in this case . torture for <NUM> pages and then poof ! delillo tidies everything up in an epilogue . nice scenes and nice sentences and big ideas do n't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read . it was my first delillo book and it will probably be my last
this is the first book by deaver that i have read . apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- i will never read them . deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller . he also has some skill in character development ; however , he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story . perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because i have not read the other novels in this series , but judging by their inconsistent behavior , bizarre motivations , and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel i doubt the other books could be much better . worse than deaver 's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist . like many other second-drawer mystery writers , deaver portrays such notable organizations as the fbi , ins , us coast guard , and the nypd as ridiculously inept and corruptible . nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story . deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics . this is normally excusable in a mystery writer , but since deaver sets chinese/american economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel . a note to deaver and other mystery writers : it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all . it has been <NUM> years since doyle introduced the world to sherlock holmes , and we have had <NUM> years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing doyle 's character . please try to be original . and also , if the final `` twist '' in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it , perhaps it should n't be there in the first place . i give this book a d .
bad , bad and bad . this book could have been condensed down to <NUM> chapters to tell the story . it was dragged out for no other reason then to make it a full book . i have enjoyed this authors other books , but this was was very disappointing . save your money on this one ladies
there are only <NUM> songs , mildy mediocre ones at best , the total run time is around <NUM> minutes ... on that basis alone it is not worth the <NUM> bucks
kate bush 's second album , `` lionheart '' , may be the weakest in her catalog . its clear bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing `` the kick inside part two '' , and instead reaches in a number of different directions , some successful , some less so . musically , the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ( `` in search of peter pan '' , `` in the warm room '' ) , a more pop structure ( `` wow '' ) , rhythmic shifts ( `` do n't put your foot on the heartbrake '' ) an almost shuffle ( `` fullhouse '' ) and a gret rock song ( `` hammer horror '' ) . lyrically , bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ( `` symphony in blue '' ) and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ( `` kashka from baghdad '' ) . the problem is that it does n't hang together well to my mind -- admittedly , my rating for the album is in many ways relative to bush 's other work , no album with the absolutelyu amazing `` kashka from baghdad '' can be all that bad , and certainly `` symphony in blue '' is strong enough to stop you in your tracks , but the album just does n't work for me . for early bush , try her debut ( `` the kick inside '' ) or the stunning `` never for ever ''
i never recieved this item . so i cant review it . id like it sent i vaguely remeber ordering it . so if i its on backorder or ill be recieving it soon let me know please . thanks
i tried many times to finish this book because once i buy it and start it , i hate to just walk away from it . but , this book did it . i was never really interested in the plot , i thought the writing was very basic , elementary actually , slow , and just plain boring . i tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up , but i never did get into to , making this the only book i 've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing
mack <NUM> could n't do it twice . his first album is tight , but this one lacks good beats . also , his rapping style is too lame to carry the off beats . the only way could have saved the album is if he would have had alot of guest rappers and producers
if you knew me , you would probably know that i love punk music .... old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly .. they days when epitaph was the punk label .. you know , the label with all the re-mastered classics , plus phenomenal newer acts anyways , until recently , this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves ... mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as `` punk . '' yes , this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise .. which is great .. i mean i would never buy this for just <NUM> decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo , but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched `` punk o rama '' since they contain very little punk . epitaph has a great extension in hellcat records to appease the punks/skins ... i would surely recommend that someone pick up the `` give em the boot '' compilations if they want punk rock . now , the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find ! bottom line , if you want punk go to hellcat , if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this , the new phase of punk o rama . <NUM> stars because i dont really care for this , but it earns my respect
to be honest , i must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something i really had n't intended on buying . there was no way to cancel it on-line so i figured i 'd give the cd a listen , since i had nellie 's first cd , which i love . i must say , i was disappointed . just seemed like every song sounded the same . maybe it will grow on me , the more i listen to it , but kinda doubting it
as a long-time fan of mountain , i found this set to be far less than satisfactory . leslie west and felix pappalardi are here , but corky laing and steve knight are absent , replaced by bob mann and alan schwartzberg , neither of whom plays well . mann 's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by schwartzberg 's drumming , which is simply dreadful . however , no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm , slogging through one ragged number after another . the version of & quot ; nantucket sleighride & quot ; is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium ; it 's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through . none of the other cuts on this album is much better ; in fact , the highlight is the moment during leslie 's & quot ; guitar solo & quot ; when a speaker blows ; the rest of the album merely blows . this entire set sounds like a contractual obligation , and nothing more
expect no sparkle from stars or script in this remake of the witty comedy classic , which has been repeatedly filmed with varying degrees of success since <NUM> . there is no chemistry between the male leads , and burnette is unspeakably bad in her cameo appearance . recommendation : see instead & quot ; his girl friday , & quot ; starring rosalind russel and cary grant ; it is easily the finest screen version of the famous stage play
disney does it again ! they manage to turn two beautiful , compelling books into a story of squabbling american adolescents . i find it supremely ironic that disney felt it necessary to turn a murderous troop of marxist guerrillas into a murderous , greedy mining agent - this from one of the most devouring , money-hungry corporations in the history of capitalism ! did they perhaps believe that depicting a troop of black soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering the boy 's family would n't be as politically correct ( or as comprehensible to a pre-teen or early teen audience ) as showing a greedy white mining agent ruthlessly slaughtering the boy 's family ? of course , francois joubert simply has to be transformed into the obnoxious harry winslow ( to make the movie more appealing to an american audience ) . and must every story involving young people of opposite sexes be turned into a `` girls are stupid ! - boys are stupider ! - i love you ! - i love you too ! '' tale of teenage battle of the sexes turned to love ? it 's been many years since i read the novels , but i do n't remember that particular twist to the story , perhaps because van der post was n't necessarily writing for the 11-14-year-old american market . if you 're at all disenchanted with the world as mickey sees ( and sanitizes ) it , skip the movie and read the books ( `` a story like the wind '' and `` a far off place '' )
i do n't care what others stated ... sabata rushed the opera to fit the lp capability , maria screamed at all times , no pianissimis , and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album . best tosca is maria callas with pretre recording . do n't buy this mono recording . maria did not understand who tosca was during this moment
i hate to take the time to write this on here ... but , as far as i am concerned smooth jazz is a sad excuse for music . i am an avid jazz fan and musician . smooth jazz is a joke
apparently , their last work with frontman steve perry and quite the let down.'trial ... ' was the band 's '96 comeback attempt , but if i remember correctly this cd was a stiff from the get-go.i tried so hard to get into this fifteen track disc , but even with a duration of <NUM> minutes , i just couldn't.the songs do n't completely suck , they just do n't appear to have much life.fantastic cover , do n't you agree ? if you 're an old school journey fan , i encourage you to check out their new <NUM> release , 'generations ' with vocalist steve augeri , who 's been with the band for awhile now.that cd is surprisingly good , as i 'd give it <NUM> 1/2 , maybe <NUM> stars.keep in mind that guitarist neal schon is their 'key ' player
this is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller . nothing here particularly surprised me . i would guess that if you have enjoyed mr. flynn 's other works you will enjoy this one as well . mr. flynn needs a more assertive editor . his use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story . this probably is n't detrimental to the reader 's comprehension , but it is irritatng . finally , one very minor quibble : non-standard spellings are used throughout ( such as `` harken '' rather than `` hearken '' ) . this may or may not matter to any given reader , but i found it to be worthy of mention
deaver 's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound . he has the bare bones of the work down to a science , and when it comes to most of his tales , the bones themselves are strong , hearty , and glistening white . in this case , however , those bones have virtually no muscle . this tale is about tate collier , his ex , bett , and their kidnapped child , megan . the villian for this tale , a slick-tongued psychiatrist named aaron matthews , is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything , a talent that rivals that of our protagonist , tate , a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom . as i said , the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns , as all suspense tales should , and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries , but they fall flat for a number of reasons . <NUM> . when the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities , the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize . in this case , neither matthews or collier ever speak convincingly enough , in my opinion , to warrant their being labelled as men who `` speak in tongues . '' and although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium , it still does n't seem like matthews ' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be . <NUM> . the book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type , and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs . we even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot . <NUM> . implausibility . there are some areas of the book that are downright laughable , aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess . <NUM> . my biggest pet peeve : deaver can not write dialogue for teenagers . in an attempt at creating authenticity , deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of `` like '' s and `` way lame '' s so that they sound like rejects from some b-grade rip-off of a dazed and confused remake . i understand that kids still occasionally talk like this , but deaver 's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous . if you want to try deaver , check out the devil 's teardrop or the bone collector . this is not worth the effort
beverly hills cop iii~ eddie murphy is not a terrible movie . then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment . eddie murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas . the plot is paper thin , and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies . man , i was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies . this is a mediocre movie at best and gets the <NUM> stars that it deserves . not recommended .
i would n't mind writing a review on riverdance but as of yet i have n't received it . it was ordered 8-16 and as of 10-22 i have not gotten it yet . is this normal
i thought the album was boring . i did n't watch nashville star but i 'm a big country music fan and i like to listen to new artists . i bought the cd and loved the catchy song `` i break things '' . the other songs really did n't grab me , even after several listens . i was disappointed in her cover of `` i 'm not lisa '' - although erika jo has a beautiful voice , i found the rendition lacking emotion . she 's a good singer but i hope her next album has some better material
wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal . that 's how wack paul wall is . after i have eaten a full meal and listened to paul wall , my dinner is regurgitated through my ears . i am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage . this guy would n't know lyrical content if i slapped him with a mos def cd
as much as i like morgan freeman and ashley judd , i really wanted to like this film . i enjoyed them in kiss the girls , and i expected another interesting film . their performances were the only bright spot , but they could n't rescue this movie . this film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream . there was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible . as many other reviewers noted ( i only wish i had read the reviews before i wasted <NUM> hours with this celluloid pile of feces ) , it was so very predictable . i rented <NUM> films yesterday , and i had trouble watching both of them , for very different reasons . the other film was `` monster '' , starring charlize theron and christina ricci . i almost could n't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and i forgot that it was a movie . it absolutely is a gripping story , and ms. theron richly deserved the best actress oscar that she received for it . conversely , i almost could n't watch high crimes because it was so ridiculous . do yourself a favor and skip this one .
great idea for the book but spoiled by incorrect facts and explanations on almost every page ! thus it is good if you use it for the questions but not the answers . someone ( wish i had the time ) needs to list all the corrections on a website ( just a suggestion ) for this book to be fully utilised - until the author can correct the mistakes . ( if someone gets the website off the ground , i will gladly contribute correct answers ) having said this , i am still glad i got the book for the questions and to be pointed in the right direction . if only the author would correct the answers .... gavin atp
dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed . the only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller . other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the alan smithee psuedonym - what a pity mr. king did n't . just awful
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick . a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant . it was n't a `` bad '' movie it simply was n't a `` good '' one . boooooooring ... zzzz .. zzzz .. zzz
i watched anger management on the plane . since there is nothing else to watch , and the flight is more than ten hours , you usually watch whatever is on t.v . i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad , though there are some funny parts . there is some offensive language . overall , it 's a bad movie and is not worth watching .
i grew enamored with eric carmen 's music , drawn in by not only the many honest , complicated emotions of his first two solo albums ( especially boats against the current ) but also by the occasionally hard-hitting pop of the raspberries . i got away from carmen 's work for a long time , but recently have been relistening to the old lp 's and gave change of heart a spin . after hearing it again , i was surprised at three things . first , most songs seemed half-baked , with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly . these are short songs , devoid of development and any compositional reach . second , the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time . overdone in the all-star backing musicians ( danny kortchmar ! leland sklar ! nigel olsson ! burton cummings ! jeff porcaro ! ) playing very simple stuff . overdone in the too-thick orchestration . timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on `` hey deanie '' and other examples throughout the album . finally , i was surprised by the brevity . only <NUM> tunes , with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track . again , underlining the overall theme of an uninspired , tired work
sorry , folks , i found the sunday wife to be shallow , predictable and just plain boring ! none of the characters were appealing and , as i said , i thought it a boring plot
i recently gave this movie another shot , at the request of a friend . i was impressed , this time , with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography . it 's as if every scene could be a postcard , and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing . and the songs are great , if a little `` forced '' into the movie . unfortunately , that 's all there is , except beautiful brad rowe , totally wasted here in this nothing piece about self-indulgence and galling disregard for everyone that loves you ( while pining away for what you obviously ca n't have . ) add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others ( sean p. hayes ' character ) while simply pursuing your own desires . ( `` i want to be there for him . '' ) right . it 's so artificial , it 's about as convincing as plastic palm trees . there are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers , but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long , heart-felt pauses of nothing . someone made this picture to fulfill their dream , and did a fine job of casting and cinematography . there is little else to see here . even as a fluff piece , it 's barely worth your time
i bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from . the accounts are potentially very enlightening , but the author 's writing style obfuscates their values . her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who i was reading about . while i do n't know of any other book which tells these stories , there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective
well it looks like my question regarding why these two `` classic cartoon favorites '' dvd 's are being released in september has been answered ! anywhey being honest , i do own one dvd of this series and that is called `` starring chip n dale '' that is because there has never been a chip and dale collection on dvd before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons
if you want uncut original version , always look for original licensed production . not us release . its a foreign film , it should not be us version to begin with~ ! hello ! ! ! ? ? why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie 's fighting scenes . and us release ruins the speed and sound as well.i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable , and higher in quality . american market always like to `` americanize '' and `` control '' . regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market . why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way rest of the world enjoys it ? ? no one makes hollywood american movies to `` french version '' or `` chinese version '' ~ ! this what americans are doing~ ! well , enjoy the cheap `` american version '' then~ ! lo
pundits would have you believe that fox news and rupert murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism . they even based a bond villian on murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies . nothing gets a liberal 's eyes rolling than when you say you watch fox news . this attackumentary wants you to believe that fox is biased and not credible . watch this attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions . the former reporters gripe throughout this `` piece '' that rupert murdoch changed how reporters operate , for the worse in their opinion . what actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change . they had to work hard , something they probably never did before . murdoch , like any driven person , demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees . those that could hang , rose with fox news . those that could not keep up appear in `` outfoxed '' . fox does have a bias on its commentary section . this draws ratings . the thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the journalism from the commentary sections even with fox putting a big sign up saying `` commentary '' . they are so used to their `` mainstream '' liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they can not tell the difference anymore . here is my latest scorecard : mainstream media : latest and greatest from reuters , a major supplier of news to the always objective `` mainstream media '' ; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened . this photographer decided that his photos ( or the war ) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image . how many other war photos have been doctored this way ? on the reuters ' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage . you had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story . i guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident . the bastion of liberal `` non-thinking '' ; new york times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on . in other words , they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events . they also revealed secrets that hurt the world 's efforts on fighting terrorists . cnn - nicknamed the clinton news network during the <NUM> 's for swallowing anything the clintons had to give and asking for seconds , the only thing they were upset about during the whole lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk . on their online `` news headlines '' section they repeatedly have lou dobb 's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news . lou dobb 's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for cnn and everything he states is opinion not news . you would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike fox they do n't have one . they think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news . usa today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal . oops , turns out it was n't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily . over <NUM> % of the american population agreed with the bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating . cbs 's dan rather , this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the republican revolution swept through congress in <NUM> . all his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away . he launched a smear campaign against president bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable . his background investigation was nil . people discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it . after everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant . the editor for the los angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the <NUM> election . finally there is newsweek , whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries . they were so eager to report the desecration of islam 's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened . they ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves . the blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain ? that is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer . if so , that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the world . perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues . these are just minor examples of how the `` mainstream '' media operates . these are real stories and influence real events in the world , sometimes with serious consequences . this is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day . if you want more then read the book bias by bernard goldberg to get a real understanding . i will stick to fox news as i have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news . like any prudent person i take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means . i do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct . cnn , reuters , cbs , newsweek , ny times all fall squarely into the `` dubious at best '' category . all i have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because fox separates the opinions from the facts , allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and america loves them for it . the liberals hate fox news . fox actually investigates and reports on what happened ; not what the liberals wished would have happened . they show the liberals for what they are , full of $ % $ ^ . they hated it when fox repeatedly showed then president clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up , that is until he saw a tv camera and started shedding crocodile tears . fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the <NUM> 's was due mostly to newt gingrich . clinton had a disastrous first <NUM> years of his presidency . gingrich 's congress would not send clinton the pork barrel projects so he could n't spend to excess . i wish we had gingrich leading the congress doing the same to president bush . i am sure rupert murdoch is feeling `` outfoxed '' ; right now his network is ranked numero uno as it has been for some time . this dvd is hovering between <NUM> and <NUM> . i am ranked higher than it is .
i have never seen a worse production by national geographic than this . i have lost respect for them after this awful dvd . they did not do their homework , nor did they connect the dots . very disappointing . watch `` 9/11 - in plane sight '' instead
all the care bear merchandise is heavily marketed to preschool aged children but these `` original '' dvd 's from the <NUM> 's are far from appropriate for that age group due to the evil scary content in every episode . the new care bear movie `` journey to joke-a-lot '' is much more appropriate for young children
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta . their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie . besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it . as usual , uma 's acting is simply dreadful . i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad . how she became a `` star '' in hollywood is beyond me . she is not attractive nor can she act . she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit . i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles , they call her . john travolta is not much better . his version of `` cool '' just does n't do it for me . his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak . and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so . the only reason i gave this movie <NUM> stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn . their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie . i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping . while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes , i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes ; they were so funny i had to see them again . cedric the entertainer was also pretty good .
it would help if you 'd list the films in this collection so i could tell if i wanted to buy it
this is a horrible , horrible book . it does not deliver what readers have come to expect from a good romance novel . first , this novel is full of interesting history that the author does not describe in greater detail . she is a very poor historian and should concentrate more on the romantic part of the plot . all she does is confuse the reader with her vaguely described historical events . second , the male protagonist is mostly unpleasant and often cruel . very rarely do we see a soft spot in his heart for the heroine . i was really hoping that there would be a major confession of the & quot ; hero 's & quot ; love for the heroine at the end of the story , especially after the way he treats her throughout the book . but no . he never even says the <NUM> little words we have come to expect at the end ( at least ) of a good romance novel . we are just supposed to assume he loves her . very unfulfilling ! third , there are numerous loose ends at the end of the novel . definitely a book to avoid at all costs
... i was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1 ... and of course i did buy it right a way .... then i was shocked when i started to read it .... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools reference guide .... and actually a lot , lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well , i lost my money ..
godel 's theorem has been entirely overused ! lets get one thing straight people : all that theorem says is that in any decently powerful formal system you are forced to decide between either have a complete but inconsistent system , or have an incomplete but consistent system ! it has no relevance to ai , so go find some other argument to bolster your bio-bigotry
i bought this book for my pre-k class , to go along with our weather unit on rain . the cover looked so nice i thought it would be a great book . in fact , the illustrations are quite nice ; the problem is there 's really no story here . the language does n't flow ; its very choppy . the children did n't enjoy this book , and have not asked for it to be read again . good children 's literature should have a story to it : a setting , problem and solution ; a definite beginning , middle and ending ; and well-defined characters . this book has none of that
cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by mottola and been taken under diddy wings.this cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all im hearing .her voice is very weak and low , sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely can not perform live.this is not quality music.i would not reccomend this cd
the storyline and acting in this movie are painful , to say the least . the main character , devon , is too annoying for words . the band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melodramatic , and there is no plot line what-so-ever . i know we can expect these types of movies to stretch reality , but to show the main character begin school at one university , drop out and transfer to another university , and then return to the first university ... all in one semester was absurd . have the writers of this movie ever attended a university ? did they do any sort of research for this at all ? i would not recommend purchasing or renting this movie . it is not worth the money . if you feel you must see this monstrosity , i would borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to buy it , pull up the main menu , and go straight to the scenes with the band performances . the whole movie is garbage and a waste of time .
dear amazon , do n't ever recommend any grateful dead to me ever ! i consider it an insult to my undeniably good taste in music and movies and the like . i tried to step outside myself and tried to understand why this `` band '' is so goddamn popular , and i still gladly do n't get it . the worst part is i saw stupid jerry on some documentary on ifc and i enjoyed what he was playing , but this grateful dead ? they 're boring ! not mellow , boring ! ! their is a difference
the best part about this book was the intro . in fact all you need to understand what the late mr. bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction . the rest of the book is a chore to read . the confusing and tedious writing style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make . someone should have counseled mr. bloom that `` brevity is the soul of wit . ''
i write from the perspective of a life-long fan . this was one of the first modern bands that i loved and i followed their every release from my preteen years onward . they seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically , and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production . but on this release , they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion . that hurts to say , but it is painfully true . i 'll accept this as their auto-pilot record . the reason i give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate yoshimi , an album i initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the soft bulletin , as a proper album ( albiet a lateral move )
the first thing you should know about the hurricane is that it was based on two books , one of which ( the sixteenth round ) was written by rubin carter . the second thing you should know is that rubin carter is not a man of exemplary honesty . the third thing you should know is that the other book ( lazarus and the hurricane ) on which this movie was based was written by two of the canadians who bought into carter 's hokum , as have so many after them . i will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that carter makes in his book , since other posters here have already done a good job of that . instead , i 'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews . these are divided into three groups . the first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride . if you belong in this group , i do not fault you . hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public . but let me ask you this : if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title `` hero , '' would you still rate it highly ? if your answer is `` yes , '' then you belong in the second group , those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama , and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies . to this group , i have this to say : if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story , he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right . it 's called integrity , and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability . you say this is a dramatization and not a documentary ? well , even a dramatization should be done with some integrity . i can go along with some minor embellishments here and there , but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story , that , in my book , is unforgivable . and so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie 's dishonesty ? vested interest does not render their arguments invalid . finally , to the third group , those who actually believe that carter is in fact a martyr-scholar , i ask you to please open your eyes . there is absolutely no documentation to support carter 's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile , that he was a civil rights activist , that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory , and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image . on the other hand , there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man 's delusional fantasies . you say that cal deal , the man behind graphicwitness.com , is a racist ? please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html . also , know this : deal went into the rubin carter case actually believing that carter was innocent . it took just one interview for deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in carter 's statements . he went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed carter as a liar . many accounts today have it that carter is a changed man . i sincerely hope this is a real change , and not just a show . but whatever the case , the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash . i 'm not counting on that , though
the movie is awesome - <NUM> stars . hd dvd transfer looks grainy ( digital noise ) and the colors are off and washed out . as crazy as it sounds , it looks worse then i remember it on vhs . anyway , the standard dvd is better than this on an upconvert dvd player . really dissapointing ....
why wo n't this crap stop ? i keep telling you that there is no need for a sequel to the original children of the corn . crapy garbage
the first chapter will pique your interest . the next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior . the remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter <NUM> . the density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses , degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog ( i 'm serious ) . i must admit i have n't been able to finish the last chapter
i remember christmas a couple years back , when i saw a cd wrapped under the tree . hoping it would either be by the beatles or a computer game , i eagerly unwrapped it . i thought , oh no not pop music , but gave it a chance anyway . i 'm sorry i did . the first three songs are all raps , and you know my feelings toward rap ( if you do n't , i hate it . ) hot in herre is on my list of overrated songs , although weird al 's parody , trash , is hilarious . a bunch of boring songs , then landslide , which is okay ... more boring songs ... no doubt ? dear god , do n't let them hurt me ! more boring songs ... hey , hero , that 's good , do n't know why is too . more boring songs ... in my place , that one 's good ... more boring songs ... one last breath ? make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do n't buy this .
frosty is a perfect classic as always . great story and characters . but , boy frosty returns makes this one you should probably skip . first , the story and songs are weak . second , christmas is n't even mentioned . the directors have fallen for the left wing anti-christmas agenda , resulting in the kids school having a `` winter carnival '' instead . pathetic . the real frosty would melt with anger .
if a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that adams makes about thomas eakins , one would think that the artist was homosexual , heterosexual , bisexual , and a pedophile , exhibitionist , voyeur , sadist , and masochist ; and further , that he practiced incest and bestiality ( all of which , adams suggests , was driven by a desire to posses his own mother ) . take your pick ! adams covers all the bases . eakins is not so much `` revealed '' in this book as he is `` concealed . '' he seems to ignore altogether , what to my mind , are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man : that he studied logarithms for fun , that science , not art , was his first love , that he was conversant in five languages , and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness . among the more humorous assertions that adams makes about eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor ( he used an easel ) , that he shot his sister 's cat for fun ( adams conveniently leaves out the fact that eakins ' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid ) , and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses , which supposedly reminded eakins of outfits his dead mother wore . after reading this dreadful book i came to actually like it as a study of how inbred ( dare i say incestuous ? ) that some members of our academic community have become . even if you are convinced , or want to believe that abraham lincoln was homosexual , you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously
undoubtedly , felons who commit heinous crimes deserve to be sentenced to death . there is no argument there . in my view , child molestors , murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society . it should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances ; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this can not excuse let alone justify his actions . this is irrefutable ! as is well-known , psychopaths are usually cunning , insidious , manipulative , narcissistic and charming . moreover , they are unable to feel guilt and remorse . rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work . notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release . psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd . therefore , capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence
what else is there to say ? the acting is mediocre , the story line is nearly non-existent , and the only redeeming thing this film has to offer is the somewhat interesting cartoons superimposed upon the original score . the vast disconnect between the book and the movie is at its most evident when the film ends , concluding with a quote from phillip k. dick that has virtually nothing to do with what you 've just seen and makes you wish that it ( the film ) did
my first exposure to leonard cohen was hearing allison crowe singing `` hallelujah . '' i was awestruck so i decided to get the essential leonard cohen . bad decision ! the man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he 's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment . he 's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works
with the exception of missy , and lil kim track , this whole cd will make a great coaster at best . the only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin ' only . this is no hip hop compilation . straight dance to the fullest . pop for the most part . and tracks of hits that i did n't even no was hits , by a rapper almost no one cares about . even though i do like some of what he puts out but still , addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more
for you young'uns , pauline kael was a powerful , maverick movie critic who , aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer , often went against the grain of your rex reeds and roger eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human . and smart as hell . this movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever , beautiful and enlightening . i could not find one less-than-amazed review at rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better . but friend , think about it just a little bit , how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices ; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed <NUM> year olds - friggin ' kiddie porn in <NUM> scenes no less ! and the protagonist 's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot , working at a fast food joint ( with a cliched smiley face logo ) , driving a hot cherry-red pontiac and having sex with a <NUM> year old ( which is a crime in the us , ja ? no ? ) . kevin spacey 's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful . annette bening , given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned , in the course of <NUM> seconds still manages to move us in the finale . another amazon reviewer cited ray lawrence 's austrailian film from <NUM> , bliss as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for american beauty . having seen bliss several times , and being a huge fan of that movie , i think he is correct . written by alan ball , a tv sitcom writer , this film pushes a screwed-up message . it entertains , that is if your brain is on stand-by . i wish pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision
no true cw mccall fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper 's most seminal work ! looks like i 'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with cw mccall 's greatest hits . what a disappointment
so far , so good ... so what ! ( in it 's origional form ) used to conjure feeling . the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did n't quite hit the nail on the head . if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s , get your hands on that version .
i came to this book with great anticipation . i had read its a modern american classic , a gem that is full of meaning . i thought i was in for a treat . i worked my way through it , and wondered where , in god 's name , it was going , and why i bothered reading it . its a huge bore , a monumental waste of time . binx is about as dull as anyone can be , and none of the other characters are interesting . the reader goes from one boring situation to another . percy was trying to write about despair , and in that he was a success . the reader feels terrible despair each time another page is turned . the end of this dreadful novel can not come quickly enough . i realize i might well be missing what others admire . my loss , i am sure . the book failed to move me . its not for everyone . i do not wish to disparage those who like it . many regard it as great . i do not
what is the exact need of academics to write their autobiographies ? case in point : hazel barnes . an academic who was the first to provide a faithful translation of sartre , she also wrote an excellent little study , an existentialist ethics . if she had left it at that , she might have been left with a nice little intellectual legecy , albeit , a mostly anomymous one as her books go out of print and more precise translations of sartre become available . but she has to write her autobiography , and if there ever was a useless tome , this is surely it . though well written , the reader will quickly come to the conclusion that there is nothing really to write about , nothing that could n't have been captured in a magazine article for the new yorker or the american scholar , that is . i found it a surprise that she was , indeed , an existentialst , for she is surely among the most repressed people on the face of the earth . not the stuff of existential heroism and certainly not the stuff to charge a person $ 20.00 or so dollars to read
i read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them . in addition to this book , i purchased illustrator cs killer tips and adobe illustrator cs idea kit . now , not to the insult the author , but this book was horrifying . i felt like i was reading a boring , difficult college textbook ! i 'm not new to adobe or the interface , and i self-taught myself elements and photoshop . i must say that i was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid , visual detail , and failure to get me intrigued - how could i be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork ? i have to find another illustrator book so i actually learn something ... what a dissapointment ! the cd was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on cd . plus , some of the lessons were advertisements for steuer 's online classes . ha ! the only good thing was the art that it did have was in color , and color is good - which is why i gave it one more star than i would 've . if you buy it , do n't open the cd so you have the option of returning it
jaws was great , jaws <NUM> was very good , jaws <NUM> was bad - but zthis one is worse . i have jaws and jaws <NUM> on dvd and will keep them . i had jaws <NUM> and jaws - the revenge on dvd - but i gave them away . they are not worth keeping ! walte
i have some of ehlert 's other books and have found them to be wonderful , however , i found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it . although the author portrayed activities that cats do , i was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children 's book . i teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class
i think it 's disgusting the lack of research yale daily news put into this <NUM> guide . there are a hundred things wrong with this guide , but just from opening to the school i go to ( university of delaware ) , and seeing that one of the things i have to do before i graduate is `` go to the stone balloon , '' i could tell this book was just a new cover to the <NUM> with updated admissions statistics . the stone balloon , a historic university of delaware bar and music hall , announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on main street . this was true , and it was closed for the spring , and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over . pretty sad that no one will be able to fulfill the insider 's guide 's instructions . sweet life yale ... do some research and stop making money reprinting the same `` best-selling '' book each yea
so whose brilliant idea was it substitute jean reno 's trademark french accent with a bloody yank 's ? what a total let down , the entire appeal of this bloke is his gruff , natural french accent and to trade it off with a yankie accent is beyond comprehension . idiots . ray duncan australia .
simply put , the music is fine , but for what it 's worth , you might as well see the movie . unless you have a hunger to listen to music intended for background music , just get the movie , you 'll see that the songs fit better when placed along with the movie
what a total hack . do people really think this guy has talent ? he is ruining the genre ! stupid me bought the cd because it seemed to be everywhere ... big mistake . avoid
well , i was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack . i do not however think it 's fair to say this is a cd only for blacks because it 's all rap ! that 's ridiculous . but , i 'll overlook that naive comment & say , even for those of you who do like hip hop , there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing . i loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one ( let 'em fight ? ) . that 's the song i wanted the soundtrack for & i was so disappointed . as for those of you interested in that lynyrd skynyrd song playing during the car chase , it 's called , `` saturday night special . '' the soundtrack was n't bad , just a disappointment . to see all of the songs that were played in the movie , visit : http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack
after reading other reviews , i expected something a little more . other than gim me little sign , the first listen did not impress . maybe it will grow on me . if not , my daughter may like it
if you are looking for video of actual bomb tests , this video is not for you . it is basically actual d.o.d reels declassified . it shows many in-depth testing measuring blast waves , heat etc . good if you are of the sceintific nature , but gets a little boring if you are just looking for some 'action '
i admit it . i bought this one because i think sandra bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box . i need not have bothered . she is a very minor character with minimal screen time . she does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a `` good show '' . the story revolves around a madison avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion . he sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income . near the end , he begins to see the light and reforms himself . there are a few brief moments of laughter , a few moments of sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief
this movie was terrible . even for an indie it was pretty dull . the acting is lousy , and the story is boring . just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver . the script is almost laughable and i actually considered turning it off a couple times . it was a good effort , but i would n't waste my time on this stinker
seriously , folks ... this band sucks ! every one of these hits ( dancing queen , sugar sugar , mamma mia , take a chance on me ) is dated , sugary , and awful as awful gets . how they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me . keep away ! ! ! ! ! ! !
if you want to waste two hours of your life watching a movie about the most implausible hooker in the universe , you are in luck . jane fonda plays a call girl with a sensitive pimp and harmless businessmen for clients . she goes to a psychoanalyst on a regular basis to moan about her failed attempts to become an actress/model . all we see of her on the job is having sex with a few passive businessmen who meet up with her in high rise hotels and wait for fonda to guide them through the act of sex . donald sutherland stars as the world 's mopiest detective investigating the disappearance of some offscreen character . did i mention he is a man of few words ? most of sutherland 's screen time is spent in mute staring and trying not to react to anything . when he does say a few lines it is in a mumble that registers no emotion . his investigation consists of going up to hookers and asking them if they would like to be interviewed by him . <NUM> % of the movie is sutherland and fonda wandering around from one setting to another asking extras if they know something . like a guided tour
`` problem child '' has made my top ten worst movies list . how could anybody enjoy it ? `` problem child '' paved the way for little monster movies . in its footsteps would come `` clifford , '' `` the good son '' and more recently , `` are we there yet ? '' in this genre , children are little sadistic monsters who stop just short of killing their adult supervisors and cackle maniacally . usually , these movies are billed as `` comedies . '' in this one , this kid could have a tea party with damien from `` the omen '' and samarra from `` the ring . '' he 's not funny , he 's not charming or cute ; he 's a scary little creature . plus , are we supposed to think it 's funny that his idol is a serial killer ? that he writes letters to him ? that the serial killer comes to visit and `` takes him away , '' therefore putting him in danger ? that the father proves himself at the end by battling the killer and rescuing the kid ? horrible , cringe-inducing stuff . the filmmakers should have had a long discussion before making `` problem child .
it tells me 'no device to download to ' . amazon , debug your product before you take people 's money ! ! you are acting like microsoft . there is no way to report this to amazon . does anybody there care anymore ?
like other uses have pointed out , the music are not conducted by john williams nor performed by the london symphony orchestra , and they do not sound the same with the music from the movies . you are still getting a nice collection of music , but for the real john willims music , you got ta buy the original soundtracks . these products just do n't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by john williams
i 'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with , but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence . this work , however , is pure tripe . critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it 's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas . the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play . in my mind , it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis , because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense . beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the `` extremely difficult themes '' and `` brilliant artistry '' of the play
although the book is filled with very nice and informative pictures , it is nevertheless quite limited . i needed to relocate a toilet in a renovation project . advanced enough , right ? well this book was useless . there was no information on venting requirments . if you like learning-by-example , this book may be for you , but only if the examples match what you need to do
i 'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and i 'm even less interested when they deal with children . children in peril is not entertaining . that said , however , i picked up `` rage '' at the airport . and thus , my first jonathan kellerman novel . this was a dumb story and far from believable . i could not suspend disbelief . if you read mysteries , the bad guy screams `` it 's me ! it 's me ! '' in the first <NUM> pages . i was hoping i was wrong , but unfortunately , that was not the case . so , i tagged along and watched alex and milo chase obvious red herrings , useless leads , eat some donuts , theorize and solve the mystery ! i can not mention how bad i thought the story was without giving away the plot , but let 's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years . i 'll try an earlier j. kellerman book . maybe it will be better
i purchased this dvd a while ago - fyi - a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie . i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found . here , years later , when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe . i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this book from what other reviewers said really does n't add much new info in terms of the much-publicized deaths of tupac , biggie or jam master jay ... which is one of the big motivations i 'm sure most of us consider reading a book like this . also the fact that this book was written by a cop from the once secret `` hip hop police '' is also somewhat novel . you 'll spend most of the first <NUM> pages sifting through this guy trying to straddle the fence -- sounding official & professional to rep police but also trying to come off as empathetic and altruistic in his quest to `` save '' hip hop 's elite from crime & corruption . read this book with a grain of salt ! ! ! ! i dropped it after page <NUM> ( go to a bookstore or library and read the bottom 2.5 paragraphs ) . parker 's basic premise in his defense of policing hip hop is not that he sees the stars as needing protection ( which is why soooo many rappers still roll deep , packin ' heat ! ) , but rather that so many are still so heavily involved in criminal activity he 's doing what he does for public safety . give me a break . who 's really afraid of ludacris ? jay-z ? kanye west ? chamillionaire ( or <NUM> cent for that matter ) ? parker dares to use the term `` public safety '' in this defense and discusses how any number of acts of gunplay could `` breakout at any time '' when rappers are in public . let 's see , we 've got ... a raging war in iraq & the threat of nuclear terrorism . ongoing police brutality issues . trickle down damage from crooked politicians . real crime . all kinds of sexual predators . increasingly fragile school systems not to mention poverty , intolerance & all kinds of social ills . yeah , parker 's doing a great job defending society from public enemy no . <NUM> : poor black men who use hip hop success to rise to a better life . skim the book 's latter chapters for the minor details you seek if you 'd like , but i pass on reading more of this crap . i 'm sure he 's got interesting stories to tell , but this book just reads like an opportunist looking to make a fast buck by preying on the weak-minded blind enough to believe rappers ( code for young black men ) must be tamed
lewis ' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but i was disappointed by this book . although interesting , some of the essays are indicative of senility . the title says `` interpreting '' so i will allow him creative license . expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in stalin 's treatise on the u.s. constitution
sounds just like the last record if you ask me . always has a great band , arrangements , and mixing , but bob 's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters , old cars , the dustbowl , annie , frannie , sarah , ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with . god bless him
<NUM> years ago i was so stoked that clapton was finally coming out with a new album , i walked five miles to deorsey 's records in lewiston , maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record . the still near virgin vinyl remains in my lp collection and has only been played once . once was enough . heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness , inspiration and technical ability . sad .
i found that i was not disappointed by any of herrmann 's works , until this one . the first track is good , but much of the others do not sound like the herrmann i know
this movie is one of the <NUM> ~worst~ movies i 've ever seen . these <NUM> minutes seemed more like <NUM> hours . and for chrissake - he 's not an american
this film had a lot of potential -- interesting premise , compelling characters and a strong cast -- but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story . there 's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director . the above-average cast , that includes the wonderful bonnie hunt , michael learned and several other very likable young actors , seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone . the redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion did n't quite make it . a pity as , despite the film 's continuing weaknesses , i wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters .
... do n't buy this cd . most of this is emo , and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy . there are a few good bands on this cd -- enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice , but it 's not worth your time if you 're an actual punk fan . it has an interesting mix of music , but it does n't fit together too well . the upsides to this compilation are as follows : one , the dropkick murphys song , and two , it 's inexpensive . however , it 's even less expensive to just forget about buying this cd at all
very dissapointing . too many wildlife creature noises . if i had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises i would have looked for a title that matched my request . i wanted to hear rain and thunder only .
i do n't know what you people are talking about . this album is horrendous . terrible , peter-frampton-cum-boston arrangements of velvets songs . the guitar tones alone are enough to make me want to scream . this is not rock , nor is it animalistic . for anyone who loves this album , i recommend doing drugs . or having some soul
do not watch this garbage ! this is the worst movie i have ever seen . i 'm honestly upset with the other reviewers here for misleading me so badly . this film is so bad , with so many problems i do n't know where to even begin . i can only hope that someone on the verge of watching this changes their mind after reading this review . if i saved one person from buying/watching this disaster , then i have done my job . at the very least buy it from the used bin , that 's where mine will be
i 've seen many films from all over the world including bollywood but `` devdas '' is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards , so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in bollywood films . its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen
i 'm not into r & b so i 'll skip the tracks i 'm not interested in . bought it only for junior vasquez dub which is i must say really bad . totally boring . i think junior should release his latest work ( simone denny - cliche , deepa soul - as i am ) on cd 's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes . very unsatisfied
this is a very simple review . call it a warning . this album by gm is cheesy , period . the squeaky vocals and the weak synth lines are far inferior to gm 's other album , `` from here to eternity . '' on that cd , the tracks are very trancy , features electro vocals and nice chord changes . the beat is stronger and harder . especially good , besides the title track , is track # <NUM> : `` first hand experience in second hand love . '' excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals , dated expose sound effects and stabs . it just rolls and rolls and rolls . nice driving cd . however , e=mc2 is a cd to pass on . i was very disappointed . one more note , this album sounds old and dated . `` eternity '' could still work a dancefloor now . no one would think it 's almost <NUM> years old
this is one of the very worst books on law and legal theory i have ever read . the authors deliberately confuse important issues , libel those with whom they disagree , and string together a series of logical fallacies in order to reach a set of conclusions they favor for other reasons . readers who waste their time on this book will learn nothing of law and -- strikingly -- less than nothing of legal philosophy
i felt the author was showing off his skills but not teaching much . other than the very basics , you will not learn much about rythms and technique from this dvd .
the new edition ( vocalist stu block ) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous , overkilled `` <NUM> 's power metal '' screams . it just does n't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release , which is a far cry from the last one anyway . there 's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies , further widening the gap from oblivion . i keep listening ... hoping it 'll grow on me & i 'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore , nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals , but it just ai n't hap'nin . fortunately for the band tho , it would seem i 'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving . i sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as i am . these guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd . better luck next time fellas
i 've listened to the samples of this cd , and i was proved right . this cd , along with this groups other cds were emotionless , has no depth , originality , or meaning . the songs like `` without you '' are just sickening to listen to . not only do their voices sound sickening to the point where i want to wretch , but the songs on this cd are just depressing to the point where you want to kill yourself . the originals were depressing , and so are the new versions of these songs . this is really getting old . buy something from joseph vargo instead . maybe there is something with originality in it . i 'm sorry , but the truth hurts , and we need to face it . do n't buy this cd , or all of il divo 's cds unless you want someone to laugh at you
i 've seen several mentions of grainy photos , and they are grainy , however that is the least of the problems with this book . first of all many of the figures have been traced out from the background the photo was taken with and pasted onto a plain white background , causing multiple problems , like persepctive and flat or squished body surfaces where the models were originally sitting or lying on something . the `` cutting and pasting '' is sloppily done , and in many of the photos the tips of toes and fingers have been cut off , very annoying . secondly , there are several photographs that take up two pages ... but this is a bound book , so the entire center of the body is not visible , and because a portion is in the binding even the countour is not usable . in additon to the two page layouts , there are multiple other figures that fall directly in the center of the book , and are rendered unusable by the binding . the only thing i can figure is that this was originally a spiral bound book , or had pull out pages , like a magazine centerfold . i ca n't imagine someone would intentionally publish a book with such an awful layout . lastly , some of the `` motion '' figures are cheats . one in particular is clearly a man laying on something propped up on a pillow , but he has been cut and pasted as though it were an upright pose ... maybe that explains why so many found the poses `` unatural '' . that would n't be a big deal if the book was n't called `` the figure in motion '' , and was maybe titled `` some figures in motion , and some sedentary but turned to appear as though they were in motion . '' could n't give it no stars , as i will use some of the photos , but my money could most certainly have been better spent
these is beastly , useless dvd . instructors do n't count at all and do n't dance to music . they dance only cumbia constantly . they have no style . do n't buy this video , you will not learn salsa . i think to return these dvd
reading dark harbor is like watching a mediocre tv show that you ca n't be bothered to turn off . i listened to dark harbor as an audio book , so i do n't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because i ` read it ' while i was doing other things that had to be done anyway , like driving . if you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - dark harbor is not for you . this novel is about as innovative as an episode of murder she wrote . to illustrate : stone barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim 's wrong hand . ( i think i actually saw that one on murder she wrote ) woods either ca n't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply does n't care . it is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in dark harbor . this is n't because the clues come together in any logical way , but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel . you can just tell . this does n't mean that the solution makes sense . in fact , there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced . it is as if woods could n't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through . woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do ( except of course , to have sex with stone ) . holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island . on her second trip she has an obligatory romp with stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel . why was she kidnapped ? i do n't think anyone - including woods - can answer that question in any plausible way . my theory is that woods needed to work holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages . it also allowed him to include holly 's dad ( another regular character ) in her search . wood 's motive seems obvious . the kidnapper 's motive however is n't - her kidnapping makes no sense . but clearly this was something woods did n't think was worth worrying about . the best i can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read ( of course , in my case it was read to me ) . it may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read ( and certainly not to buy ) - but as an audio book from the library ( with a limited selection of audio books to choose from ) it helped me pass the time in traffic .
there was no <NUM> page inventory insert . where can i get one ? d.charles william
let me get myself straigh here first . i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins . i loved the first one , and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through , with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies , instead of saving them from some kind of `` evil '' foe . also the fairies were pretty cool , and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism . they were high tech and armed with laser guns . unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz . now let me rewiew this particular book . its a horrible read . who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts ? no me . now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd , i mean seriously a `` barbie '' doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they 're boys . how old is the author anyways ? two years old ? well obviously he 's not married thats for sure . i always thought that these books were aimed at <NUM> and <NUM> year olds , not four year olds . anyways enough of that , the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father . i read colfer because he writes futuristic books , that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who does n't even solve robberies , instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war . all of the wicked humor is lost , there is no action whatsoever , the main charecter is n't a genius with wicked humor , and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others . heavily downgraded , adn obviously the worst parts . do not even read this thing . get some other artemis fowl books , or read alex rider , . thats a very good read .
what is the longevity of john bradshaw 's book , and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time ? the book was published over ten years ago , and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards , of which it was a part . the first thing i noticed about bradshaw 's writing is its sheer verbosity . he writes in a roundabout way , rather than concisely and to the point . contrast him , for example , with a writer on buddhism or taoism ( say , alan watts ? ) . writing on buddhism or taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise , but the human growth movement is broad and billowy , and concise writing may not be important to the authors . and bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement , to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all : shame . bradshaw reports that he is a theologian , but also someone who recovered from alcoholism , and was deeply shamed as a child , which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome . there are many fine snippets from his book , which may be of use to folks , but overall , i think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations . to paraphrase another well-known quotation , `` people can not live on concepts alone . '' if he had given more personal studies or little case histories , it would have been much more helpful . instead , he includes page after page of some `` guided '' meditations or shame inquiries , which were totally useless to me . if you are looking for guided meditations , this is the place for you . so , in all , bradshaw 's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time , in my opinion . it 's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth . anyway , it was a bestseller once , and that 's what counts , i guess . it did have its <NUM> minutes of fame , and a lot of books never even get that . diximus .
i saw this in a bin at wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99 . well , i want my money back . no wonder i only remembered two songs from them carmel and what would you do . i would say get the singles to carmel and call it a day . i never liked what would you do because it was contradicting ... guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice . wait .. hello .. you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was . the rest of the cd is slow and boring . claudette ortiz has a great voice . she sort of sounds like beyonce in songs <NUM> and <NUM> or vice versa . save your time , energy , and money on this cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio .
absolutely one of the worst books of all time . it took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there . i had such high hopes for this book , but it is not worth your time , so do n't bother . i was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to nola so at least half of the characters could be dumped . i will give the author another chance , but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books , forget it . that goes for the rest of the characters .
do n't buy it . be warned . it 's stupid . you will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last
to borrow from a previous reviewer : a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering .
while i appreciate what tipler was attempting to accomplish , he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective . skip this one !
no other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as stephen king . for roughly three decades the maine writer churned out book after book , each one selling more and more copies . he 's a world unto himself , the lucky fellow ! he 's so successful that he could throw out his pens , put away his typewriters , bury his word processor six feet under , never write another word in his life , and still have enough money to wallpaper the great wall of china five times over . in many respects , it 's stephen king 's world and the rest of us are just living in it . but , and this is a gigantic but , an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy . we all know the good ones , the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel king 's career to even greater heights . `` carrie '' is probably the best example , followed by `` the shawshank redemption '' and `` the dead zone . '' these are wonderful , magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them . then there are the rest : the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river . welcome to the children of the corn franchise . `` children of the corn <NUM> : isaac 's return '' introduces us to hannah ( natalie ramsey ) , a young lady heading back to the now infamous gatlin , nebraska in order to answer some important personal questions : why am i drawn to a town out in the sticks ? who is my mother and where is she ? will accepting this role in a schlock , straight to video clunker enhance my career opportunities ? you can quickly grasp the metaphysical importance of such ponderings . in quick succession , hannah runs into a string of problems . pushy town cop cora ( alix koromzay ) gives her sass before she even arrives in town . doc michaels ( stacy keach ) , the town quack , insists on imprinting his own weird impressions on the girl . but the most bizarre occurrence confronting hannah during her first visit to gatlin is the sight of a short man hooked up to a slew of machines in a hospital . this figure is none other than isaac ( john franklin ) , the original apostle of `` he who walks behind the rows '' in the first film . apparently , the boyish preacher did not perish at the end of `` children of the corn , '' although it sure looked like it then , but slipped into a deep coma that has rendered him helpless for all these years . the arrival of hannah , however , fulfills an old prophecy that will see isaac out of his coma and possibly bring about a reemergence of the corn demon . as `` children of the corn <NUM> '' progresses , not so much in a linear manner but in a serious of jerky fits and starts capable of inducing whiplash in the viewer , more of the `` storyline '' emerges for our consumption . it appears that many worshippers of `` he who walks behind the rows '' survived the peter horton induced apocalypse at the end of the first film and grew up . they 've been waiting all these years -- raising their own children and acting like responsible adults -- for isaac to awaken from his slumber and call forth the demon . why ? i do n't know . since cult members always considered anyone over the age of eighteen the enemy , i ca n't imagine why grown people would welcome the malevolent corn god with open arms . would n't he just pop up out of the earth and rip every person with age wrinkles and five o'clock shadow into bloody pulp ? the whole subplot involving hannah 's reunion with her mother rachel ( nancy allen ) withers when confronted with fundamental questions the movie refuses to ask , let alone answer . it should go without saying that numerous individuals find the idea of a possible isaac/corn devil reconciliation an unpalatable situation . these are the people who end up on the wrong end of scythes and other sharp objects . what we have here is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise . so many characters parade past the screen , from gabriel ( paul popowich ) to jake ( william prael ) to a dozen others that it 's impossible to keep it all straight . only the presence of the attractive natalie ramsey and the very gorgeous sydney bennet in the role of cranky morgan help keep this film down on stomachs made queasy with banalities . john franklin , who also co-wrote the script , does n't do much beyond what he did in the first film . sure , he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences , but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this is n't the isaac we remember from the first film . is it possible for the chief apostle of a demon to collect social security checks , particularly when said demon makes it a point to hype the virtues of youth ? like i wrote earlier , there are more questions here than answers . by the time the film shudders to a halt , all i could bring myself to praise was the gore , and there is precious little of that floating around compared to other entries in the series . the dvd contains no extras , which is just as well because that would require the viewer to spend more time with this no account film . i suggest you skip , forget , overlook , reject , condemn , avoid , cast off , jettison , exile , dump , burn , pass over , disregard , denounce , discard , and abandon `` children of the corn <NUM> '' as quickly as possible . rearrange your sock drawer , change the furnace filters in your house , or reattach those plastic thingies to your shoelaces -- do anything you can think of to avoid this atrocity . if you must see it , good luck and may god be with you .
well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book written on <NUM> , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so
i decided to give this book a chance , but wish i had n't . the author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive . that , combined with his extreme cynicism , really prevented me from enjoying the book . not recommended
i do n't want to hear any more of their music on the radio . it is all just nonsense , and none of it should have ever been made . they are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory
mr. yancey has no respect for the teaching of the bible . god is always there when it hurts . in fact , god allows hurt . look at book of job . god allowed satan to kill job 's children ( ! ! ! ) and tempt his wife away from job and give job a horrible disease . god was always there . in fact , god was a part of the plan to cause job to suffer . why ? on a whim . satan said that job would lose faith if disaster struck him , so god said , `` okay , give it your best shot ! '' sometimes , god sends disasters into your home for a whim , for a wager with satan . this is the lesson from the book of job . sometimes , god himself brings pain and death because christians refuse to uphold the interests of the kingdom of christ . look at the book of jeremiah . it was god who chose to kill israelites , destroy the jerusalem temple . in fact , jeremiah specifically states that king nebuchadnezzar of babylon , who was not a believer , was anointed by god to bring destruction . it 's like god anointing bin laden to destroy america . that would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation . the bible is clear that god chose king nebuchadnezzar to destroy the jerusalem temple and kill israelites . and anyone who opposed king nebuchadnezzar opposed god himself . how does this apply to bin laden . this is how seriously god takes desecration of his house , the christian church . god will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy america if america desecrates god 's houses . and opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing god himself . mr. yancey should think seriously about what god teaches about suffering . god gives suffering when believers desecrate his house . god sends death and destruction when christians refuse to uphold the interst of christ . this is an important lesson for america to learn
if you speak french this dvd is probably fine - but for me there are better dvd 's that focus on a dancer 's life in a ballet company . the subtitles were cut off at the bottom and on the sides so you either looked at the dvd without knowing what was being said or you struggled to figure out the subtitles since they were only partially shown .
i am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review . this movie is neither good nor bad ; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript . to compare it to `` run lola run '' is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology i would recommend `` cube '' .
or how about b is for , `` an r rated scooby doo '' ? yes , it 's really that silly . funny thing about abominable is that i was actually entertained . but was it a good movie ? the idea of providing potential viewers/purchasers of this movie with a customer review is to help them decide whether or not the movie is worthy of purchase , right ? or let 's just say that a review here is to determine whether or not you should even rent/view . i gave abominable <NUM> stars . then why ... after i just said i was entertained by abominable ... would i only give it <NUM> stars ? well , it 's this dilemma i 've been having with trying to fairly rate movies in order `` to be helpful '' . what i mean is , in the genre : aliens would be <NUM> stars . therefore , is abominable a <NUM> star movie comparatively ? no way . the descent would be <NUM> stars . therefore , is abominable a <NUM> star movie comparatively ? no way . slither would be <NUM> stars . therefore , is abominable a <NUM> star movie comparatively ? no way . i am left with an entertaining movie that does n't compare to the aforementioned . hence , i can ( fairly ) only give abominable <NUM> stars , right ? look , according to amazon a <NUM> star rating means , `` i did n't like it '' . but that 's not really true . it was okay . it started good and went quickly into the spiraling vortex of a silly , continuity-issue , b-acted , made-for-tv horror flick . so go for it if you 're compelled to watch a movie about big foot gone wild with the classic deaths of those that break the `` scream '' rules of what you 're not supposed to do in a horror movie ( complete with gratuitous nudity ) in order to stay alive . abominable is not quite as bad as the 2-star `` i did n't like it '' rating that i donned it with . but it sure ai n't no 3-star slither . it 's a <NUM> made for tv b-movie . b is for snow job .
my twelve year old who read and loved the e. nesbit book five children and it hated this movie . i have also read the book , and the movie has very little in common with the original story . there is no eccentric uncle and cousin horace or secret door in the greenhouse . the children are not sent to the country because of the war . even the wishes the children make are not true to the book . my nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book . so , although it is pleasant , clean , family entertainment , i think e. nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book . it seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized e. nesbit 's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from c.s . lewis ' chronicle of narnia series
waller , why are you writing this stuff ? you 're an elderly gent , retired i assume , who made a bundle off the sugary-sweet and sappy bridges of madison county . take the big money you made and run brother -- quit demonstrating your literary nincompoopismo !
when are we gon na start boycotting this bubble gum pop bull s % % t ! lil john is one of the worst emtertainers on this earth . his flow is rough and terrible and he wastes beats on a regular basis . i guess all of the zombies and sheep wo n't appreciate me dissing this retarded muppet but someone has to stand up and say something . this album is a just like a vicious string of herpes infecting the youth of many nations . we need some hip hop penicillin like krs one , mos def , and kwel
i 've been a fan of this series for years , but this one was really disappointing . one almost gets the impression that braun herself has lost interest in the series ... ( if she even writes the books anymore ! ? ) of course , the books have always been slow , but they did have a certain charm to them , making them the perfect bedtime material ... but , boy , did i sleep well , when i was reading this one ..
i really enjoy the great synthesizer sound ( usually this phrase would be an oxymoron ) of this film . john carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist ( writer , director , composer ) . so , i am not in any way criticizing the music itself . my gripe is against this particular cd release . i was expecting to receive a cd with only the music . unfortunately , very few of these tracks are music only . most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie . if this only happened once or twice , i would n't mind so much . but it 's nearly every single track . would you buy the star wars soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks ? how about the godfather , lord of the rings , gladiator , or any other great motion picture soundtrack ? if people want the dialogue , then they will surely buy the dvd . but most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only
i had to type this review to hopefully prevent others from making the mistake of buying or watching this `` movie . '' to all the intellectually enlighted who gave it positive and glowing reviews , i can only say you must also like yoko ono music and abstract art . this is not a war movie or a social commentary whatsoever , it 's garbage . i read the book years ago and thought the book was kinda ' goofy , but the movie 's off-the-chart bad . if you want to watch a kid have sex with ladies , watch people vomit , watch the seemingly constant need to urinate in glorious color just about everywhere every five minutes , and listen to a kid scream a lot for no apparent reason , then get his father killed , also seemingly for no good reason , this is your movie . oh , and let 's not forget the decapitated horse head filled with eels - man , coulda ' lived without that image all day . overall , worst movie ever made dealing with the third reich . if you want an excellent older german anti-war movie which actually makes sense , buy `` the bridge '' , which i can not believe has not been remade by a major studio yet .
after two hours of watching it , i still do n't know what it was about . yes , the scenery is fantastic , but a national geographic film would have done more . i applaud the acting of milla jovovich , and nastassja kinski . but , the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie . i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd . as for wes bentley , that 's acting ? he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him , or a co-worker being blown to `` kingdom come '' ( that 's a pun based on the movie ) . he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier . the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book , but very loosely based , and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development . they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest .
i 've been an acne sufferer since i was <NUM> years old , and have been on every antibiotic , tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics , and have been on <NUM> courses of accutane in the last <NUM> years . my acne has never been extremely severe ... but it has been quite resistant to most treatments . i was really excited when i bought this book and read the reviews , it sounded like it might really be the cure i 'd been searching for all these years . the plan was a lot of work , especially at night with the ice packs , but i was willing to try anything . i followed the plan exactly as stated for <NUM> full weeks with little to no improvement . that was my experience .
the offspring .. a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around ( the damned , tsol , agent orange , adolescents , and di ) , have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from tsol , the damned , and other great legendary punk artists , and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this . i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash .. after that , i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still , i loved them .. but i was iffy on this .. i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were , but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer ... i must say , i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it ... that was <NUM> years ago . now , i think this album is just okay .. i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop , but as for keeping the disc , it isnt . i say get this .. get it cheap .. rip it to your comp and then sell off . it gets old fast
this is typical political hip hop . rants , slander , and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories . all accompanied by weak beats , bad lyrics , and terrible performances by m ( oron ) -1 . this political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped . save your money and buy ghostface 's new album . this will be surely headed to my list of the year 's worst albums . big big big big thumbs down
i 'm impressed that disney is comming to their senses and putting out this old vintage stuff on dvd , i remember this series from when i was a young kid , i originally said in the review for `` chip n dale rescue rangers '' that these dvd 's are not worth it because i only liked the theme song but now i changed my mind . the animation is superb , the story is wonderful , and some of the characters ( cubbi and sunni ) are cute ! i 'm not happy because all they had on the dvd were episiodes of the tv series only no bonus features whatsoever , not even interviews with the original voice actors , i know bill scott is dead but june foary is still around along with corey burton . disney this is still your property please treat it with respect !
i bought this book based upon some of the other reviews that said it was great and they could n't have been more wrong . i needed the book on short notice so it cost me $ <NUM> and it was absolutely useless . there is nothing useful in this book at all . i ended up just winging the toast because i did n't have time to look for another book
i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely . the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring , considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history . in sum , there are much better anthologies out there than this one
more predictable than an old tv land episode of bonanza and much less entertaining , this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons , one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system , one an idealist , and the middle son , tristan , played by brad pitt , a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature 's anger . at least that 's what i think he was doing . the fact is i never was a fan of this movie , not back in the <NUM> 's when my best friend loved it ( and predicted julia ormond would be a superstar -- sorry , gina , if you ever read this , i just could n't resist working that in there , ha-ha ) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing . i do n't think there 's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone . it 's not spectacular in its setting , it 's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story , and i found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring . to each his own , i know some love this movie , but from where i sit , this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
i did not like hardly a thing about this war picture , anthony mann or no anthony mann [ director ] ... robert ryan was superb being in command of a motley squad of straggler/soldiers ... even the macho aldo ray was a know-it-all who showed no fear whatso ever [ that included army officers also ] ... that 's alot of claptrap ... hip/hip/hooray for hollywood ... this stuff may have permeated us army cadres in the field [ and in hollywood studios ] but it could never have happen with a us marine squad of highly trained riflemen [ <NUM> marines ] ... nary any semblence of discipline nor any sense of mission showed amongst the enlisted men in this drab army movie ... it was a foregone conclusion that most of them would be kia by movies ' end ... i saw this movie in <NUM> ; it never impressed me with what we , [ i ] saw and done in korea with my fleet marine force comrades in the field ... many decades later , i review it with even more snickering hysterics ... no way , gi ... no way ! ! .... semper fidelis .... ssgt chris sarno-usmc fm
an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late 50s to the late 70s . nothing more than `` sex & the city '' transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras -- if thats your cup of borscht , more power to you
esta novela es a la literatura lo que la planta nuclear de chernobyl es al medio ambiente
what the hell is up with all these <NUM> star ratings ? ? man . meat puppets <NUM> deserves <NUM> but this one ? up on the sun is full of lame guitar licks , annoying whistling , chanting , wtf ? ? mp <NUM> is like a piece of art while this one is more like a piece of crap , sorry guys
this soundtrack is terrible , and i have loved most of vangelis work for more than twenty years . the only good cut is `` titans '' dont waste time on the rest .
`` cat on a hot tin roof '' - the version i have is from <NUM> , and includes the original written act two , and the act two version tennessee williams wrote for broadway . that said , i found this play to be the worst williams play . i read `` the glass menagerie '' and `` a streetcar named desire '' and i found both to be emotional , engaging , and thought provoking . this play does not include any of that . i failed to see the point , and i did n't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to margaret ( maggie ) . i was very disappointed . i do not recommend .
this should probably go to customer service , but your return policy says you ca n't return opened cds so if i ca n't return it , perhaps others can learn from this what can happen when you order online . i thought i was getting the whole cd and when i opened it and put it on , it turned out to have the song not ready to make nice , one other song and then some video of not ready to make nice . i checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it . can you send me the album i thought i was buying
i have some surrender cinema stuff and they are really good softcore . but , this dvd is not . it 's completely censored , if you buy it , you 're gon na miss all the good parts . it lasts only 70+min when it 's supposed to last <NUM> . do n't buy this unless you get a really uncut version
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series . years later i read s is for silence and was hooked . i started to read the series -- backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning . i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh <NUM> lbs on her <NUM> ' <NUM> '' frame ) . however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best . you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions -- -belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few . the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics . but even with these issues , i did finish the book . grafton at her low point is still a good read
john calvin blazed the trail for most reformed reviewers : if you disagree with what is said , kill the 'sayer ' . ad hominem critique , attempting to discredit an idea by crushing its advocate , is particularly odious in theological discussion but many of the chapters is this book raise it to an art form . the argument of this book : the classical description of god = the biblical description of god : take our word for it , we are the experts , no discussion needed . anyone who disagrees with us is obviously inspired by satan to destroy christianity . god loves only people who think like us - to hell ( literally ) with the others . classical theology presents a picture of god as a disconnected ( in his ultimate nature ) , unfeeling , micro manager who chooses to allow evil when he could stop it . as a recovering calvinist who finally read the scriptures and took them seriously ( how 's that for a back door ad hominem ? i 've still got it ) it appears god has revealed himself in the bible as something diferent : a loving , involved creator/father who is working with his children to restore a fallen world . if you are looking for argument by stipulation , beyond the bounds is for you . if you want careful analysis of germane scripture passages , look elsewhere
okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as `` bring it on '' , `` clueless '' , `` mean girls '' and , especially the superior `` heathers '' .. is painting a false picture of what this movie is .. i 'm sorry but , `` john tucker must die '' is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films . these other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers . `` jtmd '' appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer .. and wonder is all i did . this film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together .. the results are one big mess . 2.5 stars is all i can give .. the other films mentioned above are the ticket . `` heathers '' = <NUM> stars . `` mean girls '' = <NUM> stars . `` bring it on '' = <NUM> stars . `` clueless '' 4.5 stars . all four of these movies have something that `` john tucker must die '' doesnt have ..
this is a horrible cd ! it was like nails on a chalkboard listening to it then i finally had enough and took it out of my player and threw it away . there may have been <NUM> songs on this cd that were actually ok , but the rest of it were these obscure songs that came from under a rock somewhere .
it has moments of funny , but overall only good for one or two plays . like howard sterns said , good idea but i do n't know if i could sit and listen to it
i was hoping to buy an italian food cookbook . what i got was a cookbook about italian `` inspired '' creations that he , the author , himself created . mostly this book seems like a pat on his back for he mentions how everyone loves this or that dish every few pages .... and he is proud because he made all the recipes himself ! ! not authentic to me . hardly any recipe contains garlic and i feel forced to doctor the recipes in order to get any flavor . my only hope for this book is that the deserts ( i have n't tried one yet ) makes up for the rest . review addition : ok ... so the tiramasu was very good . bought lady fingers at trader joes just to save you the effort of looking in every grocer and not finding it like i did .
upon the brief trailers and dvd cover that gave me the visuals of this show , i thought i would really enjoy it . it was set <NUM> years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion ( later in the series ) the mets ( led by such greats as lenny dykstra and daryl strawberry ) beating the red sox ( roger clemens , wade boggs , to name a few ) in that world series . the error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports . that , however , is in the foreground , much like the yankee 's world series was ( led by reggie jackson 's heroic and never ending home run hits ) in the movie `` son of sam '' serial killing spree of sam berkowitz in nyc in the <NUM> 's . at first glance , i thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion , all the way down to the end when bill buckner misses the easy grounder to first base . what we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives , tie it all together , and have some meaning come out of it . the result is what i should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays : dull , boring , spinning wheels that get stuck , continue to spin , and lead nowhere . there is nothing poignant , profound , or purposeful with the script of this movie , and if there is , i guess i was to wrapped up in watching the red sox let another one slip away . first off , we have a decent cast to say the least : michael keaton , robert downey jr. , and catherine o'hara ( home alone fame ) are all actors who have shined in the past and though are n't so much of household names anymore , can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits . the problem is not them . the problem is the script ! michael keaton is a man about to go through a divorce . his daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman ( remember , this is <NUM> , not <NUM> ) and he 's seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes . it does n't seem to bother him much though , as the character keaton plays ( nicky rogan ) is a famous playwright in the big apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else . the camera is always showing the cabbies id cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the middle east . strike one : this little display does n't seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film , and seems not only unnecessary , but also ultimately annoying after about the fourth cab ride . rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he 's not sure how it 's going to be perceived by the masses . strike two : despite all the things outside rogan saying he 's supposed to be worried , scared , or bothered , he does n't really come across that way . if anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion , feeling , or personality . he is supposed to be nervous because critic david schwimmer ( downey jr. ) is going to be the major reviewer of his new play . schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of syd barret ( see : pink floyd founder/drugs/gone crazy supposedly/left band/becomes artistic recluse ) in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he 's had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery . strike three : this entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground , including a standoff with rogan in schwimmer 's apartment with rogan 's teen daughter half naked on the couch , it just does n't fly . by this time in the movie i 'm saying i do n't really care . i 'm going to give them one more chance at bat ... strike four ! : at one point in the movie , rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety . okay i 'm thinking there will be some bernard goetz ( see : bernard goetz/weird engineer/ny resident/4 would be robbers on subway/goetz shoots them/becomes cult icon/hero/crazy dude for self defense and gun ownership ) type situation brewing . the gun is fired off in schwimmer 's apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt ( thankfully , i mean i did n't really want anyone to get hurt ) . after that ( i 'll call a ball one ! here ) schwimmer and rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize : they both are boston natives , and huge red sox fans . rogan 's mistress , who happens to be funding his new play , and rogan 's father , who is in ailing health and rogan visits now and again , make guest appearances . there are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned red sox bond come into play , but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning . sure , the fat lady is n't singing yet , but like they said in the special features part of the dvd ; the world series was n't technically over for the sox in that game , as the loss forced it to game seven in which the mets ultimately won , but it did n't matter . every fan knew it was a done deal , despite the hope . in the end rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her ( nope , this time its actually someone not from the middle east ) to go to a bar and watch the game . the actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan , though i still feel bad for buckner , and all the bosox fans , when that ball went through his glove and the mets scored the winning run as a result . special features : in trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film , i learned that there were basically two ideas ( <NUM> world series & playwright vs . critic showdown ) that were eventually melded into one . although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film , its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs. critic storyline is way to loose . it never really comes across strong and again , with the exception of the bosox tie between the two men , the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that do n't hold up well at all . i understand its an `` unconventional film '' but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film . in the end , this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when buckner missed that ball . it 's to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better . oh yeah , i gave it an extra `` strike '' , and its still here . sorry , you are outta here ! game over ! see you on the `` field of dreams '' someday in rerun land .
this cd should be named & quot ; songs that never made it & quot ; . except for <NUM> tracks ( jump and heavan knows ) , which are available on other volumes , the songs on this cd are all unknowns for a very good reason . it would be interesting to know the names of the dj 's who thought these were their & quot ; favorite pix & quot ;
i found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism . her notions of pauline theology , based on a platonic dualism , have been shown to be baseless . the disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism , but are assumed . the church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions , which she fails to admit to . her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing , for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church , but espousing a new religion
that moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true soad fan . ive been a soad fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential . soad was a great album and toxicity was sweet and steal this album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt soad at all . ok in all fairness if i was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully . but compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it , their older stuff was way way better then this crap . and daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and serj is much better
it never ceases to amaze me how punk bands today consistantly preach against brainwashing when they do exactly what they condemn . anti-flag is nothing more than a gimmick band who got popular riding the `` down with the establishment '' bandwagon with little real political commentary or discourse . that being said , i fully believe that bands ( and anyone ) should have the right to say and think what they want . after all , this is america , and i am serving in the army right now to ensure that we have this right . it just gets to me how they are so willing to step on the very thing which symbolizes that right : the american flag . this album is proof yet again that this is what they intend to do . i have no respect for this traitorus band and would never give them a penny of my hard-earned money . besides , would n't a real communist refuse to capitalize on their music , anyway
a chemist ( brenda marshall ) working on a new anesthetic takes the product home and tries it out . her assistant ( hilary brooke ) , who may be after marshalls ' husband , arranges an `` accident '' that reults in marshalls ' face being disfigured . marshall then murders a woman trying to blackmail her over a previous car accident and has to go on the lam with the dead womans ' identity . she plots to take revenge and everything snowballs into a nightmare worse than before . the finale sees it all as just a weird hallucination she experienced from the drug . huh ? all this mumbo jumbo is played out in a very short running time . i would n't call this a `` movie '' so much as a cheap experimental student project . there are no production values at all . the sets are cardboard and the acting is dull and at times amateurish . i know that anthony mann has a reputation as a low budget film noirist but this is the cheapest attempt at telling a story i 've seen in a while . ulmer 's `` detour '' is pretty cheap but at least it 's interesting . this was interesting at first but the ending just left me flat . low budget is one thing but out and out cheap is another . i will not fault this films ' defenders . to each his or her own . but it 's just too cheap for me to see more than once . so it 's recommended for manns ' fans and others with their curiosity meter turned way up
how anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life goes beyond my comprehension . this is what estes claims in this book . what about those who live short lives ? the whole book is geared at american middle-class readers who in general , even though they have college-education , are very naive . the language is that of the fairy-tale , or close to it , which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people . estes says that pain will clarify everything . i pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified
* plot revealed * an utterly worthless foray into english overbearance and haughtiness , this film marks hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment ' in the pre-war <NUM> 's . working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in london to indoctrinate subordinate english audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of germany , hitchcock eases the tension by making this a `` comedy '' . wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness ( the scene at an austrian hotel where the boring brits are talking about cricket and drinking tea ) , he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations , the fight scene in the baggage cart for example . his support for the upper brit classes is especially drab and tedious , meandering between hero worship and idolatry , not to mention the wooden acting of the actors . the story concerns a `` secretive plot '' about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the austrian alps , simplistic , innocuous even but hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue does n't want to think she imagined it all . of course , she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men ' . immature plot ? definately . banter , insipid and devoid of any vivacity , is exchanged between high brow english snobs in the most elusive way , bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train . this is nourishment for those who ca n't think very well . the story continues until the stuffy , pretentious , oaf-like english on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema , the brits , debating the attack itself for <NUM> minutes in proper english , sit there in front of open windows , with one gun and hold off <NUM> well armed foreign agents for <NUM> minutes . also in this scene , the <NUM> year old woman `` spy '' , jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily , how <NUM> well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate , or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off . if you can believe in the superiority of british snobs , then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film . of course you can guess the ending , the woman falls in love with the english chap who helped her on the train , and england is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact , an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid <NUM> 's but most audiences will take this as merely a `` thriller '' instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda .
as a software developer i found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering . basically , there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can . the present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information . a large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error . that 's pretty much the book . should we be concerned ? yes , but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways . i 'm not an advocate for this by any means but i 'm not terribly fearful of it either . what does concern me , and should you , is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it . to me , that was the greatest point the book made . as for government spying . we know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more orwellian ways than we would have thought possible . unfortunately , this is what i wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book . also , there is no `` solution '' provided . how can we protect ourselves ? mainly , i was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them . i really did n't care how the ceo of a data mining company grew up . i wanted to learn about the subject of the book , not history of indivuals . its not a bad book , but i grew tired of the biographies and the content did n't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed
the berenstain bears and the messy room is about bother and sister bear who never clean their room . one day , momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way . after talking , they decide to do something about it . this book teaches children about responsibility . this book is good for children from 4-11 . i thought it was a pretty good book
before i begin the review , i should take time to mention that i am a huge baseball fan . i rarely miss a game , follow it as if my life depends on it , and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than i do movies . i also played when i was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater . i had heard that bull durham was one of the best , if not the best , baseball movies ever made . as a fan of field of dreams and the natural , i decided to go and rent this one . figuring that it was about baseball i thought i could n't go wrong , so i did n't check the ratings on any of the sites as i normally do for a movie . big mistake on my part there . i could n't even make it through a half hour of this movie . there was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning . the entire thing was about sex , and i had to look away from the tv for some time . i was hoping it would get better but it never did , and after all the sex and foul language i stopped the movie , never bothering to finish it . i was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings . looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie , it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters , who i did not like at all , seemed to persist . unfortunately this movie is filled with sex , and i feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release . i 'm not some kid writing this , i am a mature conservative christian . this movie should offend anyone who believes in him . do n't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one . go and watch a real baseball game -- always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment , plus it 's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be
listening to this album is like receiving a long slow enema . i still have no idea what people see in this much overated band . i understand the comparisons to u2 ( which , by the way , is a far superior band ) , but pink floyd ? ? pink floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically ! ! creep is their only good song ..... there i said it
well , this wo n't take very long . warning ! spoiler here ! leading characters find themselves in a deadly , hopeless situation . characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly , hopeless situation . one character makes a stupid joke , gives the others the high five and then magic carpet ride starts playing . repeat <NUM> times , and there you have sahara . wacky fun ... if you play little league and had less than <NUM> candles on your last birthday cake . really , i usually put a lot of time in my reviews , but this one does n't even deserve that . dumbest movie i 've seen in quite some time .
what seemed to have worked so well in `` coffy '' just does n't here . yes , we get to see pam grier , and she 's fine , but the script just does n't give her a whole lot to do . furthermore , the villain in this one just is n't scary , with her overwrought lines and lame `` i 'm in charge '' banter ; the sleazeball from `` coffy '' was better because we did n't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end . that tension is missing here , save for one scene where grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way . we actually get to feel a little tension . however , i still feel that this below-average `` follow-up '' is more than a little disappointing , especially since `` coffy '' really set a high bar , with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists . see this only if you just need to watch another grier vehicle because it 's just not as good
this cd fell far far below my high expectations of sting . i found it unimaginative , sounding much like many of his earlier pieces
i purchased season <NUM> and thought it was so-so but then as i started watching repeats of seasons <NUM> and <NUM> , it dawned on me that this was one terrible show . i think the acting is poor ( but that could be the fault of the scripts and/or the directors ) . speaking of scripts , could the dialogue and scenes be any weaker ? invariably , on each show one of the agents will come into the scene and say `` i have a lead on the car ( or phone number ) . i 'm going to check it out . '' exit scene . i just ca n't believe that real fbi agents act like this quintet . lapaglia 's hair is long , then regulation , then long , then . . .well you get the idea . if there is an actress more sorry than marianne jean-baptiste in a lead role , i have yet to meet her . also , why are these two so argumentative with the relatives or friends of the missing person . i 'm thinking especially of the father of the autistic boy who went missing in a museum . and if it is a husband or wife who went missing , then invariably the question is `` was he ( she ) having an affair ? '' and `` are you having an affair ? '' poppy montgomery , an fbi agent ? come on . first , she has an affair with her supervisor ( lapaglia ) . then she jumps into bed with one of her co-workers ( eric close ) . not in any fbi that i know . at least close and enrique murciano look and act like agents ( and so does montgomery , when she is out of bed ) but they are handicapped by weak scripts and direction . there are better series out there . buy those . do n't buy `` without a trace . ''
of all the reasons to be interested in pi , surely curing your father 's belly ache is the least inspired . this book is about politics not mathematics
hey , i love the west coast , as well as california ( hope to live there one day ) . i believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game , and try to support anything that they do . but you do not know how mad i am at this album ! when i heard the dogg pound was comming with a new album , i could n't wait to cop it , because comming from some veterans from the west coast ( my favorites i might add ) , i had high expectations from this . this was a very dissapointing album . i guess the flaws are right in my face . i really do n't want to accept the fact that the west coast fell off , and i keep beliving that they 're going to get back on their feet , but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards . basically the spotlight reviewer `` constant '' made the perfect statement about this album . this trio 's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song `` sittin on <NUM> 's '' . it 's like each member tries to rhyme , and they do okay at some points , but fail most of the time . songs like `` hard on a hoe '' & `` fake * * * hoes '' are just horrible . the album name `` cali iz active '' you 'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album , but they did n't . lady of rage , rbx , nate dogg , and ice cube appear on this , but the fact that david banner , p. diddy , pall wall are on this damages the albums image . also as many reviewers have stated , they 're rhyme style has n't really changed since <NUM> . now thats a huge problem . there are some good tracks on this here , and when i say `` good '' , i mean they barely pass as listenable . i believe the self titled track `` cali iz active '' was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot , as i hoped that it would be like that on the album . although many of the beats are not west coast like , they are still a little nodding like `` keep it gangsta '' although lady of rage outshines kurupt and daz . `` it 's all hood '' is one of those `` good '' songs on here ( as i meantioned what i meant by `` good '' ) . overall , this is not a good album . to me this is a huge dissapointment . i denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album , but as i heard it over and over again , it got worse and worse . if anyone remembers when the west was on top of the rap game , knows that this is not the way you bring it back . new listeners , who are unfamiliar of it 's domination might like this album . i ca n't accept this at all . lyrics : c production : c- guest appearances : c- musical vibes : d overall : c- favorite tracks : cali iz active , slow your roll , do n't sweat it , honorable mention tracks : keep it gangsta , throwin up da c
well , that 's part of my life i 'll never get back ! i ca n't figure out why this movie got such great reviews ; i was totally bored by it . do n't waste your time ; there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk
i must say the positive reviews here fooled me . i expected much more fun . i would have loved a real blend of soap opera and ( even cheap ) fantastique . but this does n't even make the grade as 'so bad it 's good ' fun , at least for me . well , maybe the first episode , but the second is just very boring . yes , there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way , but not in the way of real cinematography ( very crude camera blocking ) or production design ( the hospital set is awful and as for the rest , they 're ok but too few ) . and it 's just too badly written . there 's some bad acting too , but that does n't really hurt this kind of movies . the second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven , but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets , makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them , which gets tiresome pretty quick and also does n't allow for really fluid plot development . also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking . this could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they 're creating and it ends up a mess . i guess they did n't have much time to shoot this but overall it 's just not worth your time .
the nightfox laser dance song without question is a sample/remix/remake/ bam from a part of the score from the <NUM> italian movie , the concorde affair . just saw it on 3-8-07 and saw ocean <NUM> like <NUM> weeks prior . no doubt it is the same thing only redone . randy
do n't buy this . seriously . someone is bound to release a better version . this is pan and scan , cropped at 1:33 , and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape ... like a 3/4 inch vhs . there are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film . and no it 's not the print . the film is fine . it 's the transfer . cheap , cheap , cheap . the compression is abysmal ( notice the obvious scan lines on the titles ) and the sound is piss poor . how is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the us ? disgraceful
stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid . though made during the cold war , its portrayal of russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review i read elsewhere , it was described as xenophopic . i would go so far as to say it is propagandistic . its the kind of film which will appeal to today 's dumbed-down american who thinks he 's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior . the idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film
i am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf . i had to return it
i remember this movie being really , really fun and great when i was <NUM> . my wife wanted this for our video collection and i hate myself for buying this movie . all i need to know is why she wanted this today ! if you have kids , which we do , they 'll enjoy this for the first time , but after words they 'll be as bored with it as i am . if you are looking for nostalgia , this is the movie , but if you are looking for a good dust collector , buy it quickly
there is a hint that jessica has a good voice , but apparently she is not sure where she belongs . some of the songs have a southern gospel feel , and i must confess , that personally , i do not like that wailing type of music . but , if you do , you will like some of the tracks . however , on other tracks , she uses this breathy quality , that i suppose , is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer . these two styles do not work well together . except for die-hard jessica fans , this is not a particularly good album . it is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as christmas music . at times i am reminded of marilyn monroe singing `` happy birthday , mr . president . '' the problem is that marilyn was not known as a singer . jessica needs to rethink her presentation . only buy this album if you think jessica is the greatest thing since edison invented the light bulb .
the book is good in context but i when i got to the center of the book , it split in half . now the first half of the book falls out of the binder . i 'm going to have to remove all the pages , punch holes and put them in a binder . this is a guide that i will use and reuse frequently . i 'm disappointed that it did not hold up better . i have n't even finished the class yet and i did n't abuse the book , just opened it to read and highlight certain sections . would you consider replacing the book
this is good hip-hop music , but that 's all it is . the infectious tango track from the movie , ( which was even used again for the title page on dvd ) , is conspicuously not there , nor any waltz , rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie . i thought this was a movie about urban school kids who learn ballroom dancing ! sure , the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film , but that was only about half the music in the film . and in this case , the absence of ballroom dancing tracks , for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable . there should be a disclaimer on the cover of this cd to warn away anyone looking for the great , danceable tango , waltz , etc . tracks that were in the film .
a puerile , manipulative plot in the manner of spike lee on a bad day , a director with a sub-median iq who does n't have a clue regarding how real people behave , scenery-chewing actors who rival the worst of william shatner , not a single role to inspire sympathy or empathy . what does it all mean ? a couple hours of my life down the drain . but add a tank of nitrous oxide , and you just might have a great time . this one tops my previous pick for worst movie on cable , which was `` cellular .
this book , the author and his company is a joke . do n't waste your money
i bought this cd because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it . but little did i know that they are all , all bad versions of them ! you ca n't even sing along ! this cd sucks ! do not buy this cd
my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths . i immediately fell in love with the stories , the prose , the poetry , and so went on to buy this complete volume . while it is nice to have all borges 's stories in one place , and at a reasonable price , the language does n't really hold up for me . the translation is ... well , not sloppy , but too simple , like those childrens ' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade . i have nothing against andrew hurley , but his translation of borges leaves me cold . i 'd give borges <NUM> stars out of <NUM> , but hurley ? no more than <NUM> .
do n't waste your time or money on this book . it was about as interesting as watching paint dry ! maybe danielle steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out
this ranks right up there with the blondie reunion cd as completely unnecessary . why ? these guys are relics . and i would n't care if the music was great ( i.e . joe strummer & amp ; the mescaleros new stuff ) but this is just awful . why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers ? and the spedding songs here are just wretched , at least the shelley-penned numbers are merely bad . by all means , buy singles going steady or operator 's manual , as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock , but leave this modern dreck in the rubbish tin . i picked it up for half-price and should have known better
i 've been down for monica since the beginning ; but now i am finished , i love monica 's voice , but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers ... wtf ! ! ! i want the soulfoul monica from the first cd , `` sideline ho '' are you serious ! ! ! again wtf ! ! could someone please come out with a soulful mature cd , cause this one aint even close .
well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself ? flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine ? hell no ! you see folks it 's people like lil jon that make me think in such a morbid manner . when i see special ed . failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money i tend to get a little pessimistic . but can you blame me ? seriously , let 's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second , why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd ? this is a complete joke . i 'm simply calling it like i see it . lil jon deserves no respect from any human being , not even his crack head of a mother . actually you might as well compare lil jon to elmo , elmo being a puppet has a million times more skill at what he does . at least elmo is a good and wholesome children 's icon that kids can have fun with . if i ever have a kid someday elmo will still be a hit with the kids but lil jon will still be laughed at once all his `` fans '' grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as `` music '' . meh , well who i am kidding this review ( like my last <NUM> ) probably wo n't even get posted anyway .
for some great advice email me at humorgirl86 @ hotmail.com . i have owned a cockatiel for <NUM> years and have alot of expierience . this book is informative on housing , feeding , breeding and healing . it has great pictures but , it 's not the pictures that make the book it 's the words ! it does n't go into great detail about everything . it hardly has a page on training and that does n't even help if at all . sure it may seem good but once you read it , it really is n't that good at all . i say that you should go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to make sure that it has what you want . petsmart and petco are great pet stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel
bottom of the barrel action with one of dolgh lundgren 's worst preformances ( so you know it must be really bad ) as a soviet officer sent to kill an african leader . when he gets there he changes sides and helps the african people against the soviets . sounds much better than it really is , the action is flat as is the whole movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! skip it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
reading the title and description of this book , i was excited about reading it . i found the writing not up to the task ! despite having a great deal of interest in the subject , after scanning the book i decided not to read it
the first time i heard about antony and the johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about rufus wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible . i decided to do some investigating about this antony at a local barnes & noble and what i discovered was very , very dissapointing . i find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well , but antony 's voice is very over the top and fake . by fake , i mean his use of vibrato , which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike ( not natural ) . professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed : five to six vibrations per second . it is evident that antony 's `` trained '' sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm . another thing about this band and record that i find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs . the artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings . the lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening , which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this . my conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons ... and help
the edith wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written , sensitive and poetic . while this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story , the performances of gillian anderson and eric stoltz were painful to watch . ms. anderson especially , while a great beauty , so overdid her lines that i was reminded of high-school plays that i 've seen . for emotion or drama , she spoke moreloudly . her lines were raced through , and punctuated by strange words being stressed . and while she was trying to be distraught , or betrayed , or vulnerable , her face showed no emotion at all . a little bit of eye-brow raised , or pouting lips , but that was all . eric stoltz was little better . i could n't help feel that ms. anderson was out of her depth as an actress . bur mr. stoltz , who i 've seen in many good roles , was inexplicable . maybe it was the directing that failed them . this was so disappointing to me , as i had really wanted to enjoy it , and i had so enjoyed `` the age of innocence , '' with winona ryder , michelle pfeiffer , and daniel day-lewis . but this production , from a superior book , really fell short . i would recommend the pbs version , with geraldine chaplin , if it were in any way available
except for the song , mother mother , i did n't really care for the rest of the cd . i bought it for mother , mother so i guess i got what i wanted . i had hoped to like other songs as well , but , oh well
this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
i have not seen it , have no desire to see it . give me a brea
contains many well corroborated general guidelines regarding improved diet and nutrition . however , the author often takes these guidelines to the extreme . discerning readers will carefully consider his recommendations before implementing them . yes , cooking in microwave ovens probably should be avoided especially by health compromised people but they are very much in use in russia today- they were reinstated ten years before the copyright date . and i doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless . also , dr. young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and , therefore , the validity of his dietary claims . i tried to confirm a few of his stated `` facts '' by trying them myself ; i could not . use common sense when you read about corn , peanuts , and mushrooms . i am juicing green vegetables daily and love it . i expected more from a ph.d .
a poory written , racially charged work by a bitter , probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a `` key '' to historical development . in addition to the cycle of history thesis , he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle , spengler points to a nation 's `` will '' and race as the key to a `` kultur 's '' success . this is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to national socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction -- facts be damned . interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis .
if you have kids or grandkids , who think about politics & like `` sf '' ; give them this book ! it was one of the many heinlein works that helped me grow up . it is the best & most important of his `` for kids novels '' . i ment to give it <NUM> stars ! ! ! !
thats exactly how this album feels ! you know , some irish songs and influences are good , but this is ridiculous . when <NUM> % of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting . ( spicy mchaggis jig ? ? ? what the .... ? ) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something <NUM> % irish , get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead , if you dont already have them . id also recommend the new murphys cd `` the warriors code '' if you want faster irish music done good . i give it <NUM> stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there . oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse .... thats about the only reason to even put this cd on . easily the worst dkm albu
i was very eager to buy this cd . i have the cd elixir and i love it . i saw and heard fourplay in atlanta and they were awesome . however , this cd has too much computerized music . too many sythensized voices . very predictable . in my estimation , a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler . i did n't care for this one at all
wow . i 've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.he 's done alot of great work ... but damn this cd ai n't even catchy one bit . you can hear the pitch fixer on benji 's voice throughout the entire cd ... it 's bad . like realllllly bad . and it 's way over produced ..
sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost <NUM> year later i still havent gotten the book , a response from amazon , or a response from the shipper
the content is good , but these are n't actually flash cards . it 's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page . studying with flashcards is best done by testing one 's self with cards , slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review , and setting repeated successes aside . this is n't possible with a book .
i have read <NUM> other sue margolis boks and enjoied them all . this book was really really bad
the subtitle of this book , the lives and films of akira kurosawa , is completely deceitful . there is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists . it is rather a chronicle of the japanese film industry , not without interest in itself . however , the voluminous facts , tid-bits of information about every minor actor , director , script-writer , and film composer , as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned , makes for increbibly tedious reading . while the book has its merit as a source of information , not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources . meanwhile , reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of kurosawa and mifune . the author tells us nothing about how they lived , felt , thought , behaved , what motivated them ; probably because he does n't know himself . a simple gathering of public facts , none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available , especially on the internet , do not make for a worthy book
this film is an adaptation of the first book in the new frankenstein series by dean koontz . i am not really a dean koontz fan and have only read a few of his books , but the first <NUM> in this series were excellent . ( i eagerly await the 3rd , which is past due to come out . ) this movie was a very boring , poor adaptation in my opinion . why dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books i can not understand . every movie version of his books has been really bad , this one is no exception . it is dull , which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull . it is no wonder that dean took his name off this project . that should have been sufficient warning to me . if i could get my money back , i would . save yours , or better yet , buy the frankenstein books to enjoy the real story
while this was n't the worse film that i have ever seen it comes close . this had the potential to be a really awesome and dramatic story , but it turns out to be slightly more interesting than watching paint dry
the song is called `` love '' by matt white and i had a hard time finding it too but it 's because his cd doesnt come out until feb 2007. he has a myspace and the song was also in the movie little manhatta
the characters actions , motivations , and planning skills are obscure or non-existent ( or a sign of mental imbalance ) . <NUM> stars for the history tidbits
neither author is a telecom professional . the lan discussion is <NUM> page ; the wan discussion is <NUM> more page . the word & quot ; enterprise & quot ; does not appear in the index , but & quot ; sexual motivation & quot ; does . likewise , frame relay , atm , sonet/sdh are omitted from the book . isdn receives exactly <NUM> sentences . the striking lack of telecommunications and technology could be forgiven , except for the equally apparent lack of global business discussion . the term & quot ; multinational & quot ; ca n't be found ; neither can & quot ; itu & quot ; or its erstwhile equivalent & quot ; ccitt & quot ; . if you 're looking for a discussion or reference on the role of telecommunications in the increasing global economy , this book is not for you
being a long-time nancy drew collector , i really looked forward to reading this book , but i found it to be very disappointing . i 've read a lot of the 'tart-noir ' wacky-gal mystery series , and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy , ditzy gal who just ca n't seem to get it all together , hunky boyfriend , obsession with glamorous flashy clothes , the need to keep secrets from the police , and on and on . but cece caruso just does n't come off with any realism to me . she 's too over-the-top , and she 's not even a good detective . by her own admission , over and over throughout the book , she keeps missing the point , and the clues , and everything else that would lead her to understand what 's going on and solving the mystery . cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about carolyn keene , the author of the nancy drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters . there is a lot of nancy drew collecting info in this story that was , for the most , taken from some speculative fan-made guides , honored by some collectors as the truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world . it also seems the author made up some of her own . her depiction of nancy drew collectors at their annual convention in palm springs is really unflattering . believe me , they are not the strange , nerdy , boring people she makes them out to be . for some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel . it 's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about nancy drew collecting and nancy drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that cece just does n't 'get ' . her obsessions with vintage clothes , gourmet foods , alcoholic beverages , art , and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting , but she and her gang need more characterization , and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable . nancy drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed . it 's less about nancy and more about cece and friends and how 'hot ' and 'cool ' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are . let 's hope the next author who takes on the nancy drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment
i first heard word of the track & quot ; fly & quot ; in a review of arf ! arf ! records ' & quot ; a heavy dose of lite psych & quot ; compilation in mojo magazine . the reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself , everything else was bonus . i was intrigued by the description of & quot ; what radiohead may have sounded like in the summer of love & quot ; . receiving the compilation cd , i immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it . when i heard the album had been re-released , i jumped at the chance to buy it . i have to admit i set myself up for disappointment . the only other tracks that come close to comparing are & quot ; land of sensations and delights & quot ; ( little more than two minutes ) , & quot ; christine & quot ; and & quot ; the times & quot ; . none of these tracks can match & quot ; fly & quot ; , however , and many of the others sound like jay forgot to write the rest of the song ( like the last track on side <NUM> , & quot ; nobody & quot ; , if i remember correctly ) . it 's still interesting , but i would not rate it as five stars . i 'm hoping i 'm not misled with aerovons and gandalf ( both of which i 'm getting ready to buy , and comparisons to the beatles and the zombies are enjolling me to buy these )
after reading the reviews from pbs i was excited to see the film . im so happy i rented it as opposed to getting it from here , which i would have done had i not found it somewhere else . while all the teachers had great intentions , it was obvious they were not equipped with the skills needed to engage the children in a community/learning environment . from observing body language and facial expressions in some of the classes , the children were not engaged ( notice how they lit up when they were finally engaged through the photo project ! ) . the answers to questions about behavior were the answers that the teachers wanted to hear and the teachers knew it . if they watched the video , i hope they would take not at how they talked to the students ( a couple teachers in particular ) . getting angry , answering your own question , making students write why they wont misbehave anymore , etc . are old school ways of gaining compliance and they wont reach todays children . this video would not make me want to be a teacher , if anything , it shows just how much preservice teachers need to be exposed to various cultures , they need to learn how to build a community in the classroom , and they need mentors who are aware of the needs of diverse learners . in order to attract students to a profession , make a video that highlights teachers who are able to make a difference despite the odds , schools that have made drastic turnarounds , and students who excel when they should be another negative statistic . there are some positive things in the video , they are just overshadowed by the other stuff . and , yes , i agree with a previous writer . another video could have been used in the classroom to expose students to the lives of homosexuals
i ca n't speak with authority about other deseg cases , but i am knowledgeable about the st. louis case , having spent four years on the st. louis board of education ( <NUM> - 1993. ) . simply put , deseg has destroyed the st. louis public schools ( slpss ) , which were arguably , the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg , when they were segregated and run by white lutherans . today , after <NUM> years of deseg , the slpss are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of missouri . let 's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as kozol : costs deseg has cost the state of missouri about $ <NUM> billion between the kansas city and st. louis cases . the bill in k.c . totaled about $ 3.5 billion when it finally ended , while the st. louis case has almost certainly passed the $ <NUM> billion mark . ( these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media . ) what have we realized from this expenditure ? first of all , state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case . small , rural school districts routinely spend between $ 4,000 and $ 5,500 per pupil each year . in st. louis , the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $ 11,711 : yet , those rural , so-called `` out-state '' districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students , despite having half the resources . ( i 'm sure in kozol 's mind they are merely `` goyim , '' and deserve no better ... ) ironically , while less affluent `` out-state '' districts were robbed of state funding by deseg , the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg : since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer , ( rather than their `` marginal '' cost , ) wealthy districts such as clayton , ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues , although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more . ( for example , clayton currently spends about $ 15,000 per pupil per year . ) achievement in the slpss , half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests . this stat would be even worse , except that ( i am told ) the `` ld '' ( or `` learning disabled '' ) kids do not take the standardized tests . there are legions of ld kids ... in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety , a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s . that study , called the `` lissitz study '' revealed that city students ( i.e. , black students ) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps . that is , they improved less than students in all-black , the `` naturally '' -integrated , and `` magnet '' schools . when the educational testing service still `` normed '' the sats between <NUM> and <NUM> , the average slps student had a combined sat of <NUM> . worse yet , these were the best and most motivated students , with further educational aspirations , who `` self-selected '' themselves to take the sats and were therefore , a highly `` skewed '' sample relative to the average slps student . deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that , if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools , black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids . now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject , ( `` the coleman report , '' cited in `` brown v. board , '' ) kozol and deseg 's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of `` the bell curve '' in order to understand academic disparities between the races . vested interests it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system . this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a `` co-plaintiff '' in most ( if not all ) u.s. deseg cases , and is periodically distributed `` legal expenses '' by the federal courts . these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp , which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades . similarly , deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around . one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers . the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a. , and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections . essentially , the same black women who , <NUM> or <NUM> years ago were employed in middle-class households as `` domestic '' help , are now slps teachers and administrators . ( `` i is a teacher . '' ) how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg 's other defenders . if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s , more than half would test significantly below average : we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact ! approximately half of all slps teachers and about <NUM> % of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher 's college , which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of `` higher learning '' in missouri . last time i called their admissions office , i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of <NUM> . it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers . hypocrisy a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program . it does n't take a parent long to understand that deseg is n't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day , or your daughter gets beaten up because she wo n't date outside her race . now kozol may not have kids , but i 'll just bet that if he does , they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs , if any were available where he resides . ( the jews are mustard for this sort of thing , as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it does n't actually cost them anything ... ) i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle , the jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg 's `` voluntary inter-district coordinating council '' throughout the 1980s and 1990s . ( she was paid $ 60,000 per year , but from what i could discern , her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media , so the rubes out there would n't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing , gun-shot incident , murder , or race riot . ) i considered it an `` opportunity '' because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before : `` have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program ? '' ( that is , were her kids , who would have been `` poster children '' for the county-to-city deseg program , allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools ? ) what do you think was the answer , oh gentle reader ? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants , such as jonathan kozol ... ( i 'll give you a hint : susan uchitelle 's attitude toward deseg is very much like leona helmsley 's attitude toward taxes ... )
my daughter asked for this cd after seeing it advertised on nickelodeon . while most of it is fine , specifically the veronica 's song talks about spending the night with a guy and giving him the `` ride of his life '' . not really what i had in mind for my <NUM> yr old
i 'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far . unless you 're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you 're going to find yourself lost and disinterested . the first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what i thought would be a good story . the remaining chapters had little connection to this however . the book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk , little character development , tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters . even clancy 's much maligned red rabbit is far superior to this
ev3 came in a time r & amp ; b tunes did n't gave to much space for funkyness , the deaprture of dawn robinson to a supposed solo career did n't hurt the group in the vocal aspect , perhaps , what went wrong in ev3 was n't the lack of another girl to make the quartet , in fact was the quality production that the group lack of . & quot ; whatever & quot ; the outstanding track of this album , was a slow funky r & amp ; b tune that somehow aimed for better airplay that it ultimate received , and of course was the only saveable track . the hole album is influence in that slow r & amp ; b beat , not the funky jams of en vogue that fans were acostume to . even the highly anticipated ballad produced by no other than david foster & quot ; too gone , too long & quot ; felt in the space of being pure pop , and pretty close too be another flop , but the voices of each en vogue member shine , specially maxine 's in the bridge part of the song , something that it 's caracteristic of ev3 is that was really crowed by filler cuts and really bad ones . in the name of music the only other joint that can be saved from being lost in creativityless , are & quot ; eyes of a child & quot ; poppy friendly song . despite the singles releases , and the later mention this album was such a dissapointment for many fans that expected a little more from the & quot ; funky divas & quot ; because after this they should be call & quot ; the amazing boring divas & quot ;
although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern english vernacular , i feel as though the works have had their flavor removed . if you are a purist , like i am , stick to the `` old '' translation .
found this presentation very poor . after reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech , i was a greatly disappointed . it was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -i think you all know what im referring to here . i suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point . i give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books ! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this , i ask myself how can he be an mit professor with such poor teaching skills , an off ( ice ) prof ?
the book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place . then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter , `` barriers to entry '' is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy . this is how the author sets the stage to explain `` competition demystified '' with this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy , the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis . to simplify things , it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers . this approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book `` a radically simplified approach to business strategy `` . granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers . but if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables , then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all ! . in fact one can say `` the end of competition '' . kindly recall `` the end of history ... '' the book however deserves praise for use of game theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players . but again , this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy . given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade , the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms . too voluminous , and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish .
although i 'm a great fan of the brothers work , i feel this album an insult to the serious bee gees collector . the tracks here are not rare , new or even unavailable . time for barry & robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off . even robin 's latest redition `` a live cd '' whoooooopie doo , again songs of old hat ..... i 'm hungry for new material not oldies . and please do n't get me wrong , it broke my heart when maurice died , my world stopped and i do sympathise with barry , robin and the rest of their family . being a fan for <NUM> something years i 've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come .... but please some new songs are needed from the brothers . so come on barry get together with robin and show us the great writing talent you still have . a devoted listener talisman , dundee
i have to say i am a huge pkd fan , and have read just about all of his books . and before you dismiss this review , know that i read and enjoyed valis and the divine invasion , precursors to this book , the third in the series . but , sadly , this book just was not the vintage dick classic that ubik , or a scanner darkly was . in fact , i was disgusted with this book , and to date , i have loved every one of dick 's books , even the more obscure ones ( galactic pot healer ) . though ubik and my personal favorite now wait for last year had a strong , cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures , i ca n't help thinking that transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure , and without the strong and interesting characters in dick 's other books . with a slew of obscure references to various operas , epic poems , and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd , it seemed dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication . and that is not the philip k. dick i know and admire . i suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that dick has written , then read this , but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read
so there i was ...... browsing through amazon.com and on `` the page i made '' up pops , guess what ? triumph of the nerds on dvd . seeing this , i was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when bam ! i read one of the reviews ...... still a great show , but the ambrose edition is not complete ! , october <NUM> , <NUM> reviewer : sean breazeal ( mt . pleasant , ut usa ) i immediately checked with bob , and yes , sure enough , several minutes had been cut from the original us release for `` space '' requirements . in his defense , bob had no input on this . were it me ? i 'd be hopping mad . instead of the publisher , ambrose , using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes , extended version , and extras , they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing . bob cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does . had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what i 'm sure was hours of extra content bob had to cut , i 'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it . having purchased <NUM> copies of the boxed video set ( <NUM> lost to a fire , <NUM> lost to a non-returning friend ) there would have been no hesitation to this . in fact , i 'd have watched it straight through on receipt . what a horrible , horrible mistake ambrose has made . fix it ! ! ! ! do n't walk , run from this edition . i know it 's old school , but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version . you 'll thank me later
the author has a talent for making even interesting topics deadly dull . forget this one
i always thought of dustin hoffman as tootsie , which i have n't seen , and the movie producer from wag the dog , which i love . or rain man , another fine film . but hey , the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it . hoffman became lenny bruce . bruce 's material was great at times and awful at others . nowadays , of course , none of it would be shocking . the film shows us bruce 's faults , unedited , presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses . but still , something is missing . something crucial . i do n't know what . i only know this film could have been so much better .
i was tremendously dissappointed with this purchase . this book has been produced with great care and quality . the photos are first rate , the cd is excellent however as a chef i must say that i strongly disagree with this aproach to food . it is different and wild and unlike anything you will see in the finest of restaurants . but , by taking the art of cuisine and food preparation and presentation into the science lab and creating flavor experiments we are losing the wonderful elegance and nuance of dining ! for most gastronomes this book and this food is a let down . david leicht , certified executive chef , american academy of chef '
holm is a really terrific actor , but i have a feeling his lear is probably better served by the stage than by this rather uneven production . for one thing , he really does n't seem old and frail enough . and the supporting cast does n't seem particularly well thought out - or is it just the way they 're directed . there are some particularly unfortunate moments where we get to see goneril 's twitching , overwrought facial reactions during lear 's lengthy outpourings of invective , and the thing would be hilarious if it were n't so hard to watch ( and not in a good way ) . lear shouts and everyone shouts back . there is no variation or contrast in the performances . goneril , in particular , works better as a measured , icy presence , in my opinion . in a television production , we could still see his words cutting her as she keeps her infernal composure . the shouting matches leach the material of a lot of it 's dramatic tension . it sometimes seems as if everyone is playing mad here - except , perhaps , for michael bryant , who gives faultless line delivery as the fool . i personally do n't think 'lear ' has a chance of working unless as much care is given to the characters closest to him ( particularly the daughters ) as to lear himself . the performances need to be developed interdependently , as the characters are interdependent . the music of the piece does n't come out here . eventually , it becomes tedious
jodie foster is one of the greatest actress 's ever period , but this clunky film is so boring & predictable that it just never gets off the ground & put me to sleep . a film full of cliches & dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere
i bought this cd for one song , & quot ; walk away & quot ; which was one of their best known songs . i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems . there was n't . the rest of the album is like an anti-climax . i would suggest a greatest hits instead . if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
i have listened to this cd many times and every time i listen to the single it just makes me mad . the album version is a lot better and i wonder why moby would want join forces with gwen . the cd 's version is unbelievable and i was happy to hear it become a single . i did not like moby teaming with gwen . buy the cd and see how much better moby as an artist . the music is much better and worth the money
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth . stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not , having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen . we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play . watching the first fifteen minutes of `` heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , '' is colossal torture , like status elipticus . it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen . having hopes it might pick up , that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever . a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums . do n't take my word for it , watch it yourself and see .
what a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time , the re-animator . continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re-animator series for his own , and to convince us that he can direct , producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite . beyond re-animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna-directed bride of re-animator , that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story . as with dagon , yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film . unfortunately , the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast . this is a story set in massachusetts , for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison , the reporter coming to cover the story , the guards , and a good <NUM> per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents ? it would n't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act , but they ca n't . simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast , but their acting is so bad , and their adr-afflicted lines so glaringly off , that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths . yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes ( witness the gratuitous `` nurse nipple '' scene in this film , or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re-animator ) , and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember . but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery , seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry . based on yuzna 's shoddy history with actors , one might be tempted to blame it on the director , but the fact is that in this film , jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment , basic elementary acting . his every internal and external beat rings false , his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading , and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre . most high-school students do better than this . jeffrey combs as herbert west , seasoned pro that he is , gamely plays along , but the script puts west 's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing pataky-andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film . on a strictly technical level , the cinematography looks good , the score is all right ( though often too serious-minded for its own good ) , and the film does n't look low-budget . but when the `` story '' is such a mess and the actors so inept , no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film . yuzna really should stick with producing , because on the stuart gordon-directed dagon , at least there were some good moments . but beyond re-animator is beyond salvaging , possibly the worst film sequel i 've ever seen , and way up there in the list of worst films i 've ever subjected myself to
i usually do not put aside a book before finishing it . in this case , i got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail . i purchased this book hoping ( despite prior reviews ) that it was more food lit than self analysis . however , the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships , and indeed not in its descriptions of food in desalvo 's life . if you are interested in it anyway , good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it
i received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping . i notified amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem . i received a credit and amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out . thanks billy lede
i 've read nearly every one of danielle steel 's vast collection of novels ... and this is `` hands down '' the very worse piece of garbage she 's ever written . what a joke ! it was as if one of ms steel 's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess ! do n't bother
i ca n't believe that they got a major label deal based on this album . if you want some good mcr check out three cheers for sweet revenge . that 's a good album . do n't get me wrong . i love this band . but this is just crap . there are no melodys ... it sounds like it was recorded in one of the band member 's bathrooms .. and it 's just heavy guitars and screaming about vampires and other hogwosh . skip this detour . i ca n't believe i bought this album hoping it would grow on me . it has n't
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations . in that sense , it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans . i have an objection , though , with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously , even gorgeously at times , written . didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and , worse , the result is a cold , humorless , colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup . the author , in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose , apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers . it is , in that sense , a boring little disaster of a book .
joel hershman 's `` greenfingers '' , starring the now-famous ( and utterly gorgeous ) clive owen and helen mirren , is a sweet , cutesy , and utterly empty british romantic comedy . in this forgettable , generic chick-flick , inmates at a british minimum-security prison take up gardening . initially , they are understandably reluctant to garden . but , get this , gardening ends up changing their lives ! and , after his parole , owen 's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden ! and mirren 's character is so impressed with the innmates ' gardening that she even has them garden for her ! wow , where do people get this stuff ? of course , this being a `` romantic comedy '' and all , there is a romance between owen and mirren 's daughter that is so incredibly forced , awkward , and contrived that one can not help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other . in addition , peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed `` uplifting moments '' . and none of it works . for all its good intentions , `` greenfingers '' is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates ' rooms . it 's all perfectly decent , perfectly inoffensive , and perfectly dull
i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common . i ca n't say i really liked either . the book is a little funnier . my major learning from the whole project was when `` who wants to be a millionaire '' taught me about `` roman a clefs '' , of which `` devil '' is one . perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that `` devil '' provides . meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor-in-chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough . anne hathaway is passable in her second ( or third ) `` made over princess '' role . the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as `` best friend '' lily , are mostly wasted .
with edward mcgee 's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as , & quot ; i ca n't stand to see the slaughter , but still i eats the meat & quot ; , this album 's & quot ; chops & quot ; are nothing but mindless butchery . the torture continues with sappy tracks like & quot ; you ought to be having fun & quot ; and & quot ; make someone happy & quot ; . what would truly make me happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp , golden brown . eating this tainted & quot ; meat & quot ; will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth . bon appetite
into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites . having seen the pbs presentation of this , i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited . rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction , this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups . this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play ; the staging . by forcing the viewer 's perspective , this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath . i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director 's vision
this book teaches people the unethical way to advertise on the internet - spamming . following these methods , at worse , will put you in legal trouble . at best , you will be making money unethically and making lots of people angry . these stupid get rich quick internet schemes do n't work anyways ... do n't waste your time or money
the text of this book was generally good - although it seemed padded out with a massive listing of model metadata . the book comes with a cd . the first surprise was , the cd does not include the data definition language ( ddl ) for its sample models ... there 's an extra cost for that . my question to the publisher would be , what good is the cd you provide for free ? the second surprise is the illustrations . there are plenty of them , but they look like they were done in a primitive graphics package - not in an enterprise modeling tool . they author seems to have invented his own wierd set of conventions , including `` foreign keys do not appear in the entities ... that is duplicate information '' . before you buy this book , take a look at the illustrations of the models . if you can live with the notation , maybe consider buying it
once again ultra records has put it 's trust into new york dj 's , and the results are not pleasing . disc one mixed by vic latino from nyc is good enough for radio ( stick to ktu ) but not for the higher standards set by the uk dj 's who are always well ahead of the game . bad song choices and even worse mix choices make disc <NUM> a failure . disc <NUM> mixed by the riddler , also a nyc dj is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all dj 's from nyc are all bad . better song choices here more on the trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving . this disc will be the one you play the most . but for the money it 's still a deal . i 've liked ultra 's trance cd 's alot better , but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out ministry of sound , you ca n't go wrong with any of their cd '
the movie has many none-too-subtle * very * anti-christian elements , particularly in the typical hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing `` christian '' tv evangelists and christians themselves as stupid zombies ; life as basically pointless . i am sick of hollywood rubbish like this ! so , if you 're a christian , stand firm -- do n't buy it ! !
that 's right , i said it . i love this album , and yet i still give it two stars . let me explain why . i am rating this album as i would rate any legitimate album . i do this because i understand that shatner was being completely serious about this album , and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man , and blah , blah , blah . i get all of that . but still , the album is horrendous . as you listen to it , you can not help but firmly believe that shatner thinks he 's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album . however , he is wrong . horribly wrong . the arrangement of each `` song '' is sub-par , the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life , and then there 's shatner himself . with his trademark delivery , shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track , and that 's really not such a good thing . this album would be utterly forgettable , if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have . let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review : this album would be utterly forgettable , if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have . i actually bought this cd as a british import twelve years ago for twenty bucks , long before it was in print on cd in the states , and even now , when i could have bought it for half the price , it is still worth every penny i paid for it all those years ago . you see , whenever i 'm feeling blue , i pop the shatner into my cd player , and everything gets a little bit better . it never fails to bring a smile to my face , especially mr. tambourine man and a very good year . honestly , this cd is glorious in it 's sheer awfulness . it is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it : shatnerrific . you can not go wrong buying this cd . trust me on this one . it 's my favorite music purchase ever . no , seriously . * ever * ..
has everything : a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special . it makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes , especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board , winning their applaud as well . this is a do n't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout ... <NUM> star performances ! thank you for sending me a copy . -
i picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title , but what i found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development . the ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved . i was disappointed .
first , i did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original . i looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake . also , unlike many reviewers , i had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back . the majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back . american culture and freedom is not the historical norm . that said , i was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie , nor the quality of the acting , though the special effects were pretty good , imho . the theme , however , that struck me as most rememorable in this movie , and caused me to drop an otherwise <NUM> to a <NUM> ( or less ) , is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away . as our `` hero '' encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world ( forgive my not remembering their names ) , it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for , even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down . then there 's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion , yet the moment he enters the spaceship , he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that . i could n't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience , `` hey , have n't you heard of that guy darwin ? yeah ? then why do you still believe in that silly god person of yours ? '' this movie , i believe did try to touch an issue of the day , secularism verus religion . the movie , it seems , coming down heavily on the side of secularism
first of all , let me qualify this review by stating up front that i have been a dm fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians . that being said , i think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band : a real lack of vision and originality . on the good side , many dm diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms . on the bad side , it 's all too familiar stuff with beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts . the only real difference is that the tracks on `` angel '' sound like they 've been fed through a fuzz-box . the first time i listened to this disc , i thought i had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy . i soon realized this was intentional , but had to ask myself , why ? `` exciter '' was experimental , but a truly drained effort . this album sounds like a pale imitation of bjork . they even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on bjork 's `` vespertine '' album . the difference between bjork and dm is that bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood . this album just sounds like conventional mid <NUM> 's dm music that was fed through badly recorded effects . i really could feel the creative slide with this band when `` ultra '' was released , but this record confirms what i have sensed for some time . the band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of alan wilder . martin gore is a musical genius , but he has limitations when carrying <NUM> % of the musical vision and writing . i really think gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas . unfortunately , this album sounds more like a gore solo effort than a true dm product and as a result , the music has greatly suffered . gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant , edgy lyrics . here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics ( yawn ) . a new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or i fear this may be their last record . word of advise : although this album does show some promise at times , your best friend here is itunes . download `` precious '' and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices . you may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your ipod
pros : someone recommended this book to me , and when he did , i asked him why in the world would he think i 'd be interested in a book written by a cop , specifically because i 've never made it a secret that i do not trust police and i 'm extremely burnt out on the biggie/tupac 's death considering i was n't a fan of either of them . he told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on biggie and tupac . indeed , he was right . this book delved into the jam master jay killing , along with the criminal issues of murder inc. , young jeezy , jay-z , diddy , <NUM> cent , j . lo , lil ' kim , foxxy brown , suge knight , snoop , game , dr. dre , etc. , in addition to the murders of freaky tah , tupac , biggie , and more . it was interesting to read about the details that i did not hear in these cases , such as cops handcuffing j . lo to the top of the cage . that 's a prime example of why i feel the way i feel about cops . was it really necessary to do that ? in that aspect , i can feel this book . there were many times when parker complained about how the nypd handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals , and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the nypd continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk , the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game . cons : <NUM> ) i 'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor , i can look over errors . it 's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one . i 'm hoping that 's what happened with this book . no copyeditor will catch every single error , but about a quarter through this book , i was seeing so many errors to the point where i wondered was it copyedited at all ? commas out of place , words in the wrong order , past tense with present tense , and other glaring errors that should 've been caught by even the most casual reader . <NUM> ) i was so tired of this man patting himself on the back . it was to the point where i thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was . he kept italicizing `` i '' and `` me '' as if we did n't understand that he deserved credit for something . then , he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop . in mid-story , he 'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject . okay , we get it . if the man had just told the story and his actions , we could 've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your hip-hop superman cape . <NUM> ) over and over again , he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of . the word `` accidentally '' and `` amadou diallo '' should never be used in the same sentence . that was flat-out intended murder ; nothing accidental about it . even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence , he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate , without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that . he uses examples like kanye west to say that some rappers do n't go down the same violent path , but what a drastic comparison . kanye west did n't live nearly the life that snoop doggy dogg did and there 's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many `` gangsters '' and drug dealers have in how they view life . this is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time , but i ca n't see how he could n't understand that . <NUM> ) throughout this whole book , he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong . even when he does , he blames it on his boss making him do it ( ex . creating the hip-hop binder ) . he claims he 's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he does n't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun . he talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden , violent areas of brooklyn . that in itself concerns me . to me , that 's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game clue . he may find it amusing that he caught the killer , but none of these killers , witnesses , and children in the area find their everyday life `` fun . '' it 's very easy to criticize one 's lifestyle when you do n't have to live it on an everyday basis . <NUM> ) the man seems to have all of these answers about how the nypd and lapd should operate to be a more productive police force , but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the `` why i hate cops '' attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before . there 's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas ( and quite a few middle-income areas too , the more the police act a fool ) ! every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases , he gave out real names of witnesses , as well as all the information they gave . he talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories . but the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public . some of the killers got off free , and i do n't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book . does he think all criminals do n't read ? all they need is one friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book , and there 's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses . victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them , and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops . if anything , it makes them more hesitant . just about every chapter , i was shaking my head and thinking `` he ca n't help it . he 's a cop . he does n't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information . '' even if it 's someone who has n't been in a situation where they have to be a witness , a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person 's nerves to the point where they do n't want to help you simply because they do n't like you . i went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed all the time for unexplainable reasons , even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl . it 's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities . cops have to pretty much change their whole attitude before a lot of these people will trust them . <NUM> ) he speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how jay-z and <NUM> cent have marketing deals . i do n't even understand this comparison . it 's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes . they both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them . yes , they were both drug dealers in the past . so what ? is every marketing company supposed to look at their background , ignore the fact that they are legit now , and not do business with them ? if that 's the case , america would n't have survived this long . this country was created from thieves and slaveowners . if wall street can get rich , so can hip-hop . parker talks about how most fortune <NUM> companies would n't do business with people with this background . i hate to break it to this dude , but if companies were n't going to get rich off of criminals , america would n't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of free labor and the attitude `` well , it 's all in the past now . '' as i figured , i did n't like this book and it did n't improve my opinion on cops , but when he was n't talking about how great he was , i did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports
ms. woodman 's photographs are no different than hundreds being turned out in art classes everyday . they do , however , present a consistent body of work that with the continued intellectual growth of their author , could have made contribution the world of photography . we have been denied this growth curve and that is sad
with regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this mp3 version , the original audio cd version ( `` the collector 's edition '' ) , an 8-cd set , is still available from amazon uk . i paid a little more than twice the mp3 price . the isbn number of the audio cd version is 0-563-47702-4
i love indy films and try to support them whenever i can . i heard about this film after it showed at an indy fest in new york . the reviews i read were good , so when it was released on dvd i bought it . now , i am selling it . this film was very disappointing as it raised provocative issues , but basically glossed over them . the racial issues in the restaurant were n't thoroughly explored . also , the character development of the workers was lacking . interesting characters were introduced but never fully developed . the director and writer seemed to be going for the sappy , pc slant and that ruined what could have been a thought provoking , honest view of the complexity of racial issues in modern society . another thing worth noting is that several scenes and lines of dialogue were edited out [ deleted ] from the dvd version of this film . the extras include deleted scenes but not the specific scenes of which i am speaking . one of the main reasons i purchased the dvd was because of the scene between chris [ brody ] and leslie [ hill ] , but several lines of that scene were deleted . the director 's commentary even states that they wanted to make the theme more human and less black and white or racial . it is obvious that this was their intent and it ruined the film . the final scene is just plain lame . the director stated that ending a film is the hardest thing to do and he proved it ! there were some scenes/lines , but too few to recommend this film
unless one considers `` planet waves , '' dylan 's <NUM> studio album with the band playing backup , to be a band album , `` cahoots '' has no competition for the title of the worst band album ever . yes , the first two tracks are good ( `` life is a carnival '' - great rhythms , great horns , ok lyrics ; and dylan 's `` masterpiece '' -- does nothing for me , but i understand many people love it ) , but they are available on other compilations , so the reason to shell out for `` cahoots '' has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere , and they are awful . the songs , that is , not the performances . the boys sing and play as well as ever , but their efforts -- particularly some fine danko vocals and hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless , charmless and brainless . there is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11 . nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise : all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything ( a radio commercial ? ! ) . save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians
heifetz is the supreme violinist of the 20th century . he was without a peer in his class when it comes to romantic pieces . these sonatas and partitas are not quite right for him . his approach was not of the usual high standard that he set in his other recordings
there are numerous factual errors that have been refuted in numerous places and unfortunately the author takes potshots and makes false accusations and individuals who are dead and unable to refute his charges . if you want to read this fine , just remember that even though it 's in print does n't make it true or accurate
i got this book from my grandma when i was <NUM> . i 'm <NUM> now and realize what an awful story this is ! this little rabbit gets a special gift of red cardinal 's wings , which seemed awesome to me as a kid , and his own mother and family reject him because he 's wierd ! a great book for homophobic parents or anyone else who wants their kid to know that being different is bad and if you are different , even your own parents will turn you away . i 'm just glad i read more shel silverstein poems than i did trash like this
i have been trying to read this book for over a year . i ca n't get into it and i think it 's time to throw in the towel . i have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much . the stories are interesting but do n't really seem to have anything to do with one another . too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning . the upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics .
being a huge gatecrasher and cream fan for quite some time , i was excited about this new release . well after alot of anticipation for it 's arrival , i am a little disappointed . it really does n't have the hardcore feel of previous releases . it is n't bad .... but it it is n't great . it is not because of the choice of tracks that is to blame , just the choice of remixes . many friends have listened to this compilation also , and share similar opinions . want something better ? choose an gatecrasher compilation from <NUM> - <NUM> .... you 'll love it
as always , the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent . unfortunately for me , i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection . i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks ... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm . i like progressive mixes , but i have to say this mix did n't progress to anything outstanding .
thankfully i checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it . i felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it . i made it through the cd once with my kids , but that was it . we will not be listening again . as others have said , go buy the radio disney cds ( or possibly later version of kidzbop if they come with better reviews ) . the singers ( kids and adults ! ) on kidzbob are out of tune and just painful to listen to .
after reading the oprah pick , `` what looks like crazy on an ordinary day , i was very disappointed in `` some things i never thought i 'd do . '' it took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and i lost interest after about the first fifty pages . i do n't think pearl cleage is a paticularly talented novelist ; i think she can write realistic , sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters , but the story is lacking . i loved the very first part of the book where regina burns has just gotten out of rehab , is losing her anscestral home , so she goes to her aunt abbie for help and comfort and abbie introduces regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause -- that is the story i wanted to read . instead , what i got is a very political story infused with the author 's belief that black men especially need positive role models . i believe we all need to be and have positive role models , that it is not just a black thing . i wanted to read more about regina and blue . i felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed . i hope that pearl cleage 's next novel is better than this one , but i 'm sorry to say i do n't hold out much hope
this must be the record for quickest backslide i 've ever seen . he went from u saved me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old . this all shows he was n't sincere about his spirituality . all the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal . i admit i was intrigued and entertained with trapped in the closet ; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous . to continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to chapter <NUM> ( which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it ) is unacceptable
since many of the positives of this book were mentioned by other reviewers , i 'd like to point out a few of the book 's undesirable qualities . first off , belaboring the point . when i read a cookbook , each recipe does n't specify to sift the flour . that information is usually provided at the beginning and by inference is applied to all subsequent recipes . when i read time and time again that ed is n't using bottled oxygen , it starts to drive me nuts . yea i get it . you 're the man . you do n't use supplemental oxygen unless you 're a guide , so do n't keep reminding me . maybe this style of writing was to make the record absolutely clear , i do n't know . for myself , i would appreciate an author more if they had faith in the readers to remember one generality placed in the beginning of the book . secondly , was this book edited ? on page <NUM> ed says `` i 've always believed that you need to listen to the mountain and watch for the signs it 's giving you . '' then on page <NUM> , on the same ascent of annapurna , he says `` i 've always believed that the mountain tells you whether to go up , stay put , or go down . '' he just said this ! even an amateur copy editor would see this and recommend removal . maybe this really is n't a 2nd criticism just a corollary of the first . the negatives aside , the substory concerning the french hiker jean-christophe lafaille was excellent . and learning of ed 's early days in washington racing up rainier was pretty cool . ed 's candor concerning other hiker partners is somewhat interesting , if almost risque . i am thankful to mountain hardwear for providing this book for free ...... i would recommend taking it out on loan from the library because its definitely not work taking up space in a book shelf ( there 's little 2nd read potential here )
this was so messy and mr. dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion . yuk . ! .. my partner and i were disgusted . he and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-degenerates for sure.too damn bad for your buddy . it was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of herzogs past films . we have been fans for 20+ years . looks like he did it for the money and dorrington rode herzogs coatails in a way . geez .. i had just watched march of the penguins and wings of migration and those ! are truly documentaries made by film experts . the babbling and rambling on in the white diamond made me pity herzog . he did it for the $ maybe.dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way i suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts . hey dorrington-who cares about you ? herzog .. get out of california before you rot
i recently saw brideshead revisted which i found completely wonderful . it was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films i 've ever immersed myself in . so , hungry for more evenlyn waugh ( whose books i read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work ) , i found `` a handful of dust '' at my library and figured i 'd give it a try . since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as brideshead i was filled with anticipation . my wife and i watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments , and was certainly beautifully filmed , we were left cold by it . but we figured maybe after that the movie would develop . so we decided to continue it the following night . big mistake ! i only wish i could get back the time i wasted on it . while i do n't expect `` happy endings '' in a film ( brideshead certainly did n't have a `` happy ending '' ) the ending in this story left me in disbelief . since i did n't read this particular book by waugh and did n't know its ending , i was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did . i was amazed by the stupidity of all i had just witnessed . i thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if tony would `` toughen up '' a little , transform and grow from the circumstances of his `` captivity '' rather than just look like a pathetic fool . perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching brenda get what she deserved , still it was n't enough to justify watching this film . this film was basically a `` series of unfortunate events '' , with myself feeling most unfortunate of all . my wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than i did . compared with a film like brideshead revisited , where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth , this story , was full of one dimensional characters . dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery , well written music and excellent cinematography still did n't save the story from being like a bad `` twilight zone '' episode . if you look up my reviews , you will see that i do n't go out of my way to give bad reviews , but i was so annoyed by the time i wasted i felt i need to share this . of course i have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review , but i felt maybe i could spare someone else the wasted time .
most radio shows will just play best of for free ( btw howard stern invented the `` best of show `` ) .. to think he is selling it is very bill o'rielly . sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck ... vomit , puke
i loved marques houston in immature/imx . his first solo cd was good . he 's a decent actor as well . this cd , however , does not match up at all with other stuff he 's done . all because of u and naked were good songs ( and naked was a good video ; ) ) i think there was one other good song - but , i sold this cd to a used cd store about <NUM> weeks after i got it . i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through . boring . vulgar language . mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty . sex music can be classy - but not on his cd . i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd . do not buy it ! ! ! !
* * * stars - ca n't change the above ! valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of amar sin mentiras . and it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought . while it is a pretty decent salsa album ( albeit brief ) , it is simply not in the class of his other three salsa cd 's , todo a su tiempo , contra la corriente , and especially , libre . the arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique as were the older ones .
this could quite possibly have been the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire existence ! first off ... jim carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public . ( animals included ) this movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store ... it should n't be there . the only laughs i had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie . sure you may come back and say it was a student film ... but honestly , where the hell could he or she be a student at ! ! who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity . sure the girl was fat ... nbut that was n't here main problem . the acted like an idiot all the time and then allowed people to call her big j ! ! this is a complex written all over it . this is big j calling was always followed by some cheap yogi bear impresion ... once again retaining back to the fact that she 's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear . jim carey did n't even entered this movie untill about <NUM> or so minutes into it . and just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film . i was not impressed and do n't recommend this waste o time , film , and brain cells to anyone thing . even if no one is watching this movie in your house , please do n't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the tv screen . my cat died , while viewing this film . please heed my warning
to prove america is a christian nation david barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of abner kneeland . during the 1830s kneeland , a former universalist turned pantheist , was sentenced to sixty days in a boston jail for ridiculing the deity of christ . barton cites commonwealth v. abner kneeland as example of how early american jurisprudence defended christianity . either david barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda . does barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his ? why else would he cite the kneeland case ? kneeland should only be a curious anachronism , not a legal precedent .
ugh . as a confessed bibliophile , i honestly try to give every single book its due . but this one was impossible ... poetic , but impossible . barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch . unless you eat , breath and sleep xylem and phloem , do n't waste time trying to pad through this book
as much as i like most of the songs on this cd ... it 's just too short . also the production is lousy . the recording quality sounds awful in places . hopefully , the updated compilations are better . this one is not worth the money ! ! !
... and forgotten . raw and ragged . cliche-ridden . i consider albums like `` highway <NUM> revisited '' , `` bringing it all back home '' , `` blonde on blonde '' , `` blood on the tracks '' and hell , even `` the freewheelin ' bob dylan '' as worthy of five stars . sorry , but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces . those albums are deemed 'classics ' for a reason . that said , i 'm not at all a fan of the band or many of dylan 's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album
i have been buying workout video's/dvd 's with denise austin for years and have been very happy with them . however since denise is no longer with artisan ( she is now with lions gate ) the quality has changed . the camera man ca n't seem to sit still . when i buy a workout dvd , it 's not because i want to look at a pertty face . far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we , or as in this case our child/ren , need to do . by the second workout , the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow . still , it is not the quality i am used to from denise . it could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment

is it just me , or do all sting 's new songs these days sound basically the same ? i 've loved sting 's quirky , compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as i can remember , from early police through to 'ten summoner 's tales ' - but every time i listen to one of the newer albums , i just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision . i do n't want sting to make part <NUM> of 'turtles ' or 'summoner ' ( artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to ) but i miss the clever playfulness of 'englishman ' or 'heavy cloud ' , the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'soul cages ' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'fragile ' or 'fields of gold ' - i miss the way the music and words * worked * together , and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough , or a cleverer musical joke than you 'd initially caught . the point is , 'sacred love ' , 'brand new day ' - and even 'mercury falling ' - could have been made by anyone - there just is n't anything that separates these songs ( okay , except maybe 'desert rose ' and 'thousand years ' ) from easy listening elevator music , nothing that makes them sting 's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video . even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'this war ' is certainly no 'russians ' ( even discounting the brilliantly quoted prokofiev theme ) , and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen , as opposed to letting it play in the background . on the plus side , i am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of elizabethan songs - sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge , and i 'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music . but i 'll still miss the old sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and i 'll continue to live in hope
... this movie is at the top of my list ... unfortunately , it 's the 'worst movie of all-time ' list ... that 's right , ladies and gentlemen , friends and supporters of this film ... this movie is trash ( and not just for cuba 's horribly annoying acting ) ... it 's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable ... come on ... do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction ... it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands ... and if all you base a relationship on , is the end justifying the means , well , i wish you luck with your next soul mate ..
you may ask yourself immediately into the black dahlia , why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match , that goes on for several minutes , between two l.a. police officers . what does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young hollywood hopeful in the <NUM> 's ? well , nothing really . the movie is overloaded with information , the least of which is sometimes the murder of elizabeth short , whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in los angeles in <NUM> . the filmmakers deny it in the bonus features , but it 's film noir , with shadowy lighting , intriguing characters , and haunting jazz trumpet score , and on this level , it 's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch , as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40 's film noir . it 's central theme , however , something concerning hollywood decadence , gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story , and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story . it 's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged , and it 's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh . director brian de palma 's hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film , and the cast , for the most part , are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations , even when you ca n't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information . i was never bored for a moment , the film is that sensually stylized , but it is finally grossly unsatisfying , like a playboy magazine without a centerfold , or indeed , an unsolved murder .
madonna 's best was during the early and mid-80 's . this album proved that she jumped the shark by <NUM> and has been famous for who she is ever since .
seldom has so much talent ( and money ! ) been wasted on such unentertaining silliness . robin williams , dustin hoffman , maggie smith , julia roberts , bob hoskins -- it is painful to watch them cope with the bad writing , overemoting , over-elaborate ( and dull ) sets , and just general aimlessness of this picture . everybody works really hard , and the strain shows . the fun seems forced , the situations pointless , the message ham-handed , and the music -- oh , my goodness -- the music is the most syruppy mess this side of `` pearl harbor . '' even the special effects are less than special . all in all , very uncomfortable to sit through
one of the few documentaries that has actually meant something to me and generations of like minded folks . it is such a shame that this is the best that could be done as a means of representing the movie . were kazaa alive today i would create my own cd following the chronological order of the closing credits . well , worse has been done ( i.e . bush + iraq ) so i should not complain , but instead i 'll protest and not buy this incredibly lame misrepresentation of an incredibly well made documentary
puddle of mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around <NUM> . this album is representative of their entire catalogue . for those music fans who want to hear true hard rock , pick up a good copy of any early led zeppelin or black sabbath . for anyone wanting true grunge , pick up any copy of an alice in chains , soundgarden , or nirvana album . puddle of mudd shamelessly ( and inaccurately ) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge , while living up to neither . since most of their fans seem to be pretty young , they 've been able to pull this sham off , mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands ... and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music . the songs on this album are extremely redundant , with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next . the lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content . this album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock
clearchannel strikes again ! first they bought up all the rights to the great classic rock bands music ; then they saw to it that any new music those bands recorded would never see the light of day ( bto , skynyrd , molly hatchet , and many others are still making great records , but clearchannel radio stations will not play them ) ; now , they 're spitting out their own digital k-tel compilations . to their credit , this is a pretty good batch of music . it 's missing a few great bands , simply because those are the bands that did n't sell their souls over to clearchannel to pay off the dealers and bookies . rush , zeppelin , floyd , the stones , springsteen , ac/dc , all not here because they held on to the rights to their music . smart move guys . they can still get their new material played . so , if you live in a rural area where the nearest classic rock radio station just does n't come in to good , pick this up . otherwise , you really do n't have to look to far to find this stuff , and clearchannel really does n't need anymore of your money to encourage them to continute bastardizing the music industry
they had a swagger at monterey <NUM> and were in the right place at the right time . i like about <NUM> tracks on this album ( their first and best ) . i ca n't recommend it to the masses , i purchased this mainly for historical purposes . you must listen to jefferson airplane ( first <NUM> albums only ) , peanut butter conspiracy ( first <NUM> albums only ) , grateful dead ( skip first <NUM> ablums ) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets
after reading the trilogy , i was left wondering what the hell happened ? i have just read all <NUM> of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book <NUM> and <NUM> is utterly demolished in this clunker . pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i 've come across in <NUM> years of reading fantasy . there is n't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess . if you look up ` anticlimax ' in the dictionary , you 'll see a picture of this book . from first page to last , time is wasted on boring characters , while all the good ones are either killed off , or just mia for the entire book . spoilers ahead . what about lyra and her parents ? somehow , she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl ? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations . and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops . over a cup of tea , naturally . and that 's it for him . in addition to all that , this book does n't even seem to be connected to the first two . none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends , will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of <NUM> or <NUM> . . . all in the last <NUM> pages . what happened to the story , for cripes sake ? ! and what happened to the ` temptation ' ? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it ? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with . as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries did n't endanger the universe , why not leave one open for <NUM> or <NUM> years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other . the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another . supposedly , they had more than gonads going for them , they survived death together ! pullman did n't feel like thinking it through , he just wanted a gut wrenching ending . in addition to that , he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the ` reality ' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning . all of will and lyra 's efforts are futile , kind of like - guess what ? religion for the rest of us morons . after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever , ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper . iorek byrnison , lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun . pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter ! this is not children 's literature , it 's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess . it 's totally dishonest to sell this as a children 's book , or even as a competent work of fiction . all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one . we never get closure on lyra 's parents . we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from . we never see will reunited with his mother . we get a lame battle where ` god ' dies and no one even knows why or how . lyra and will fall in love , but have to ` sacrifice ' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever , with only flimsy reasoning behind it . the mulefa and mary malone 's work together amounts to nothing , everyone just goes home . presumably , will goes home , although we never see it . all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing . the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon ? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea . it all just sort of disovles . mary forgot to be the serpent , or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa . another reader pointed out : `` phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series . instead , the story falls flat under the weight of the author 's own agendas and mockeries . what a waste of time . i ca n't believe this book actually won awards . it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly . '' it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream . instead , relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime . absurd . this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life .
this cd is great- as a gag gift . this is a redundant piece of s * * t , and i am still laughing at the amazingly cliche ' lyrics . escape the fate is like a bad from first to last cover band ... the lead singer sounds almost exactly like sonny moore . this is proof that the wold is going to hell . for good emo/screamo , pick up from first to last 's `` heroine '' and atreyu 's `` the curse ''
robert massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over <NUM> years flaying this dead horse about the romanvos . he has all ways been dead wrong with any of his `` findings '' . as any /every one knows , history is a fairy tale , slanted by the winning side . russians are incapable of telling the truth . the british are not known as exceptionally truthful . there are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the `` fate '' of the romanovs , but none will band together and state the facts . too , too ridiculous , with massie acting like moses coming down from the mount . hey , bob , after all , it is only your version of the facts . his `` research '' is sloppy , he relies on dubious sources . he violates all the basic tenets of factual , honest journalism . by all means , avoid any and all books with massie 's name on them . total waste of time , effort , ink , paper and money . he should have quit with `` nicholas & alexandra '' , so long ago
a short way into chapter i , we have `` ... the world had such a large supply of girls , and an even larger supply of perverts . '' really ? more perverts than girls ? a few pages later , tess , our heroine , drugs one of these perverts with his own rohypnol , strips him of his clothes , except for his `` briefs and socks '' , and throws his clothes in a dumpster . but in the next sentence `` she arranged his wallet , keys , and pager in a pile next to his head and draped his jacket over him . '' without bothering to retrieve the jacket from the dumpster . there are more examples like these . when a writer has so little control over the world she creates that absurdities and oxymorons populate it more densely than her characters , i stop reading pretty quickly . so in fairness i have to say that i only read the first ten percent of this book . maybe it improves later
what they said was that katy ca n't rock just yet because she 's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme . i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night . the first problem is that her voice just is n't that strong , secondly , her lyrics never come out as if they 're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say . throughout her set , there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing ( passingly honest as well ) and that was `` snowflake . '' it 's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she 's lived in california for a long time , but she hates warm weather , sounds impossible , but she must be truthful because it 's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft . i 'm sure she has potential for the future , but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who 's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop . stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out , and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim . the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important . however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs ( more than the other <NUM> ) , and steel . of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel . i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book . i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , `` collapse '' - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history . it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now . -rk
the song shakedown street is cool , better live , the rest is garbage , this is there worst album not `` steal your face '' even thou it sounds way to sleepy , ask a real deadhead in your area for a cool recording , my guess is a live recording , please see grateful dead movie c/d , that is garcia playn some saaweeeet ! guitar , seek the truth and stay free peace larry smith of saint- ros
do n't buy this one . this is just a bunch of blah blah blah written by a guy who does not master the english language , so he uses a lot of filler words just to pile up pages of useless information . not even the examples at the end of the book are well laid . he used some canned spreadsheet tables to fill in things like `` risky '' - `` medium risk '' - `` safe '' etc ... which is just a complete nonsense in forex . what really made me mad was the horrible way this book is written . this russian author could have phrased sentences using less than half of the words he used . it 's a no more than a <NUM> page book streched to more than a <NUM> pages of you know what . lame
24-hour party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung ( if best in show was not enough ) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste . the british scene in the <NUM> 's was influential and at the height of the 2nd brit wave , and michael winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way . my main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a hip-britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious . the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway , and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should : the rise of factory . i did really enjoy the joy division segments , though , even if exploiting ian curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste . unless you 're a fan of the brit explosion of the post-punk era , and an extreme fan at that , i could not recommend this film . it 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into .
i only bought this book because it was on my summer reading and it said that there were only <NUM> pages in it ... i got it and it has <NUM> pages and the print is smal
swingtime is the one astaire and rogers musical which did not transfer to dvd . the picture `` freezes '' at several points early in the film . i have not had this experience with the other astaire/rogers dvds and i own all of them . have any of the other owners of this dvd had this prob- lem
please ! a great idea <NUM> years ago , but i think the best in-shape player is mr. woods , period . this book was like jack lalane meets golf , lot 's of enthusiasm but not current training
i bought this album because i love charlie haden 's tone , and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist miguel zenon and pianist gonzalo rubalcaba in the credits . but why were they hired ? there 's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs . it certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band . i am so puzzled by the five star reviews that i went back and switched on the cd . the track i picked at random was nice , but i could n't face a second , and played a fall record instead to wake me up . i shall try again , but it seems a bit dreary .
this album was pathetic . eminem 's first <NUM> albums were classics . this album , eminem does n't know what to rap about .
i have read many books on wwii from many perspectives and have been to visit the d-day beaches four times . i can not visit the american graves in normandy without being moved . twice i have had the experience of hearing taps played near omaha beach . i have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died . i had high expectations for the book . my problem is that the book never finds its voice . at times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men . i wanted to hear more from this man . just as he starts to share , the general leaps in and throws off the narrative . let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different . ( a few photos and maps would be nice ) . if the general needs to talk , give him a separate chapter at the end of the book . we hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels . their voices could add to the history . i wish the colonel would have spoken for them
persia vanderbilt has grown tiresome for me . the endless self-absorbtion of the character has worn out its welcome . more emphasis on the town , her auntie , the shop and the plot would be welcome . less emphasis on how toned and fit persia is , and much less description about what she 's wearing might make me come back . as much as i hate to say it , it was a struggle to get through the book .
i bought this book expecting to be able to find exercises that would help me really learn the product . boy , was i in for a big surprise . if you 're a mac user , forget it ! this book assumes you 're using a pc . last i checked , many people who do web design are mac users . when i got to the first screen and saw that what was shown in the book was different than what i had on my computer , i gave up . it may be helpful for pc users , but if you 're a mac user consider yourself ignored . . . yet again
i bought this supposed to be unrated version of this movie from `` mediathrill '' and i felt that they cheated . they have cut all good scenes from this movie . i contacted them and they just denied their responsibility . i had seen this movie earlier , so i was very much aware of all the scenes . please do not buy this dvd ... no matter what .
this movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of `` grande '' to me ... there are better . i ca n't really understand why these flicks of `` female depression memoirs '' are becoming so popular lately ... i could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of anjolina jolie and brittany murphy in `` girl interrupted '' , but not in `` prozac nation '' . for one , christina ricci does not do anything for me as an actress . yes , she looks cool in that moby video , but really ... she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former `` goth actress '' -she could star in `` memoirs of winona from beetlejuice '' . anyway , that said , ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles , dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue . i can give her credit for these efforts . she brings out the worst of the <NUM> 's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to prozac . what i really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a `` new '' idea . i think the dvd would be a better `` after school special '' . it does n't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person . i ca n't find anything in the script that says `` i am different from most young women 's lives at college '' . plenty of talented , smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs , sleep with all the wrong men , and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher . where is the taboo here ? where are the revelations so terrible i need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly ? even `` prozac '' is n't tied into the movie physically until the end . there really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles .
upon its initial release , the attention that otto preminger 's `` anatomy of a murder '' attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems . when watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock , its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center . attorney paul biegler ( james stewart ) is asked to defend lieutenant frederick manion ( ben gazzara ) after a bar owner is found murdered . manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife , laura ( lee remick ) , was raped . while preparing his case for trial , biegler finds that laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature . nevertheless , the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him . stewart is his dependable self in `` anatomy of a murder . '' in fact , his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film . there is little nuance in the performances of gazzara and remick and even the great george c. scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort . yet , the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay . `` anatomy of a murder '' oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story . the investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction . for a film to run as long as `` anatomy of a murder '' does , one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film . yet , this is not the case
how can they even call this punk . were 's six feet under or slayer . maybe some cibo matto . these are the bands they need to add ....... not yellowcard and other crummy emo band
what trash ! what a paranoid book ! a true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay . no wonder that amazon stands ready to sell this book for $ 0.35 ! even then , it 's a quarter and a half wasted . no wonder also that warmongers paul wolfowitz and richard perle gave it a note of thanks . it reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over american foreign policy and steer it to israel 's favor . but the mylroie-wolfowitz-perle cabal did succeed in having the u.s. attack iraq . this only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-israel lobby . nazi joseph goebbels , hitler 's minister of propaganda , would be proud of laurie mylroie , since he once said : `` if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it . ''
some people praise ` we do n't live here any more '' as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples , tired of lies , not really knowing what to do . it is also true that naomi watts and mark ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting . the film as a result looks like a filmed version of some john updike novels ( actually it is based on two shorts by andre dubus , whose ` killings ' became ` in the bedroom ' ) . but sorry , updike is not my favorite author , and the film 's touch is too desultory for me . no , ` desultory ' is not the only real problem because i remember i was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful ` in the bedroom . ' the real flaw of ` we do n't live here any more ' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters . mark ruffalo 's character jack is having affair with naomi watt 's edith and jack 's wife ( laura dern ) already suspects , or knows that his husband is cheating . but the affair means here uninspired , clichéd sex scenes between edith and jack among the woods in oregon , with naomi watts and mark ruffalo having sex against a tree ala ` fatal attraction . ' edith husband hank ( peter krause ) teaches creative writing , and has just one book published . the alcoholism of laura dern 's character is suggested in the most obvious way ( you know what ) , but in the first place why did n't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché ? among these recycled materials , there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention . it is the brief , but efficient study of the children in both families , and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart . these clever , insightful moments , however , do not last long in the film , for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in america . we do n't want any big surprises , or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning . it is true that ` we do n't live here any more ' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in america , but the film goes nowhere from there , missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters .
what in hell is wrong with the ah sets ? why do we have to buy the same movies that are repeated the each box set . it 's bad enough that we suffer at the hands of studio 's that keep adding supposedly & quot ; newly found & quot ; extras . i love extras but being & quot ; force to get the new material each time is outraegous.i have three versions of star wars and two or three of the godfather.several of the same movies are repeated in the box sets.watch out , you are being taken advantaged of . bummer . . .
this has already been expressed here in the reviews , but just as a reminder one more time ..... this dvd is not the original version . the original version has more material and is much better . hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time .
i zipped through the first <NUM> pages of this book unable to put it down . unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that . the main character just goes on a big , boring sight seeing tour . it reminded me of that show on the travel channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design . there is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it 's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings i 've ever read . the book just stops . not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel . it 's a shame because grimsley had some great concepts to work with . in my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both , but grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the sf concepts instead of minutiae . once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the giant freakin ' portal between two worlds -- but enough about that . gee , what a lovely sofa ..
if you sre looking for the anime style little mermaid , the one with the sad ending , please note that this is not it ! now i havent seen this film but i 'm sure it 's fine lust not the one most people are looking for . the origanal in dvd format has a realy stupid cover but some nice person gave a few captures so i am sure that it 's the one you 're looking for . the cover is mainly blue with a blond haired mermaide who looks nouthing like merina playing with some fish . the titel on the top of the page reads 'the little mermaid ( uav corporation ) ( <NUM> ) ' and if you look at the extra pics someone put up and reed the revews you 'll not make the mistake of buying the wrong film . hope this helps good luch
amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling ( is he okay ? ) . because yowling seems to be part of the keith jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last keith jarrett purchase . check out something by bill evans . make the yowling stop ! please
martha grimes has had a good thing going with the richard jury series , until now . bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book . more like muddled , drawn out , and difficult . the story within a story is an intriguing idea , but it went nowhere . the plot is weak , the characters ' actions unbelievable , and the ending disappointing . i have enjoyed reading this series , but to be honest , this book was a waste of time . i think it 's time for jury , plant , and pals to be put to rest .
as a huge fan of jim henson , the muppets , and kermit the frog i was hugely disappointed . the recaps of jim henson 's life and kermit 's were interesting , but the rest was trite nonsense
alright , first of all , i have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight , etc. , many of which were inspiring and very helpful . i highly doubt that many women in <NUM> lack general nutrition knowledge , but if they do , it can be found easily online or in the library . dr. northrup 's advice was ludicrous . <NUM> grams of carbs per day ? i was encouraged when she began by citing geneen roth , but things deteriorated from there until i wanted to throw the book out the window . if anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food , please , please do not read dr. northrup 's chapter on `` nutrition . '' instead , i would recommend fed up by dr. wendy oliver-pyatt , eating mindfully by dr. susan albers , any book by geneen roth , or even how much does your soul weigh , by dr. dorie mccubbrey . these books adress eating mindfully , allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body 's responses . dr. northrup 's `` nutrition '' chapter is just another externally driven , trendy , but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health ( she calls herself a `` sugar addict '' and if you want information about that , read something like sugar busters ( until you figure out that all diets will never work long-term ) . anyway , i think she 's a nut , and i wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like women 's bodies , women 's wisdom .
even though i would agree that `` erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in `` pretty woman . '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good `` david and goliath '' story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the `` true '' story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones . however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the `` xena '' character is the main attraction in `` xena : warrior princess '' ( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character ) . erin brockovich is a vain , brassy , boorish , single mother of three young children , with no marketable work skills , a transparently opportunistic manner , who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in `` pretty woman '' ( prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree ) . the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident ; her lawsuit is lost , primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony ( swearing , cursing and shrieking from the witness stand ) while being questioned by opposing counsel . unbelievably , erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's ( played by albert finney ) firm , mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk . later , while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill , pro bono , real estate sale , erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records , that , for reasons she ( correctly ) does not understand , seem to be of particular interest to the buyer , the mega utility company , pacific gas and electric . erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg & e had ( for decades ) negligently contaminated the ground water ( surrounding one of their power plants in/near hinkley , ca on the edge of the mojave desert ) with toxic , hexavalent chromium . this discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits ( at least in terms of the award ) , in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg & e ( by and through the representation of erin 's boss ) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a <NUM> million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs . roberts gives a photogenic , if not especially gifted , performance in her role as erin . the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts ( literally gushing out skin-tight , low-cut , bustier-inspired `` work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet ) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents . while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit , she is not an especially likeable character ; rather , she is rude , verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests . albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry , the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss . the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing ; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work , the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts ( strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy , five-inched-heeled mules ) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters . aaron eckhart plays the affable , gentle biker and next-door-neighbor , george , who becomes erin 's boyfriend-by-convenience . the `` convenience '' factor is totally one-sided and for erin 's benefit exclusively ; she unabashedly uses george for free , live-in childcare , thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case . erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar `` bonus '' check ( from masry ) when the tort action case settles ; contrastingly , george gets a `` thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers . the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life , who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant . though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed , make no mistake-this movie is about erin brockovich ( indeed , i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present ) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening , generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face , due to the toxicity in their water source . erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience ( in typical hollywood fashion ) as a sort of heroine ; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people , walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich . is the movie entertaining-absolutely . inspiring- not even slightly .
well what can i say about this movie ? well one thing is : it was n't what i 'd expected . those who 'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but i still wanted to see it . i was wrong and they were right . the movie is about a zebra named marty who wants to go to ` the wild ' , bring in a lion called alex who is self obsessed , a hippo named gloria who is overprotective and a giraffe named melman who need psychiatric care . marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to ` help ' him , but four get pinned in manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to africa . along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins ( who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps ) and get stranded in madagascar , meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs . that 's basically the whole movie in a nutshell . the group fight , alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat . end of story . the entire look of the 3d animation was terrible as well . they should have continued with shrek <NUM> instead of making this movie . it 's pointless to watch . the most interesting thing in the entire dvd was the ` penguins christmas caper ' , which was n't the short movie itself , but the man who played patrick from spongebob squarepants is the polar bear . for those of you planning to buy this dvd , stay away . it 's a huge rip off . it 's just something to keep you waiting for shrek <NUM>
given the subject matter , one could hardly expect a high budget production but what gangsta king delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick . understandably greg `` batman '' davis is seeking to portray raymond washington in a favorable light but putting it out that raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far . contrary to legend , the crips were violent from day one as were the l.a. gangs which pre-dated their emergence . the most interesting thing about this documentary is batman 's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library . the historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video . low budget , low quality , low class
what can you expect from one traitor ? hi vill pay for this
oh man , this is really ( ... ) ! ! ! i rent this dvd , i really , really glad , i rented it did n't buy this crap ! i thought this series of ghost stories come from j-horrors . would be real shocking and scary , gory . that 's what u expected from j-horror ! ! .. it was looks like our twilligt zone series was made for tv have silly special effects .. kind of slow pasted stories little silly suspense here and there .. just lame ! was n't scary at all ! . . definitely skip this , it just wasting time and money , i was wondering another review from `` thom '' did he really saw this movie or someone told him about it ? .. he gave this movie <NUM> stars ? ? ? ? ? lol ! ! u trippin dude ! ! .b
i would love to provide a review of this dvd , however since i 've not received it , despite having placed my order in august ( it 's now november ) and having written to amazon customer service about the matter ( as yet unanswered ) i 'm afraid any review will have to wait
yes , it is rubbish . and some people need to actually ... yes , i know this is a revolutionary concept for some lefties ... need to actually check out the facts before writing a review or criticizing someone else 's review . this author really is a terrorist . literally . it is a matter of public record . he was a leader of the weather underground terrorist group in the sixties . his group planted several bombs and blew things up . to this day he brags about it . he says he wishes he could have planted even more bombs . if you do n't believe me , read the book he himself wrote about it . it 's available here on amazon . freakin ' morons ..
any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants , particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men 's pants . while these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants , & quot ; pants for real people & quot ; , this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does not address pants . as 5'10 & quot ; woman with a long lower torso and a sway back , fitting pants is difficult to say the least . for an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue , see singer sewing 's & quot ; perfect fit & quot ; , which has lots of pictures , clear directions for both major and minor alterations , before and after shots , and deals with all subjects . for a book specifically for fitting pants , i recommend singers & quot ; pants that fit & quot ; . i own both and use both regularly
the songs just did not get me dancing . i have to say i was disappointed . but i love kids favorite songs vol <NUM> but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
i would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code . the source code has bugs , and many many memory leaks . it is n't even formatted correctly . in order to make sense of it , i had to tab and format it correctly . not fun . there are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes . if you really want to know how x files work then get this book , otherwise skip it
abolsutely one of the worst self-help books i have read . there is n't any structure , and it 's not simplistic . the advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal . its like one chapter says this will be helpful , and then another chapter says it wont . it just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at . a book i highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is `` feel the fear and do it anyway '' much more simplistic , easier to read and get thru . and much more cheerful . i also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another . i guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both . it will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures . but for someone that wants quick and easy advice , this book is certainly not for them . i 'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing .
this book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating ... well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle . read `` the fat fallacy '' instead , it provides much more practical information
while i am a blur fan i just can not listen to this drivel . it 's picked up this cult status among blur fans as it 's the heart-rendering story of damon albarn 's break up with then girlfriend and lead singer of wire rip-offs elastica , justine frischmann . <NUM> is a document of that break up and my god it 's useless self indulgence . mindless even . first we 'll start off with the singles . tender - a plodding gospel song that goes nowhere and proves that damon just ca n't hack it when it comes to soul no matter how much he protests . long winded and uninteresting coffee & tv - while i marvel at the video , i do think that that takes away from the fact that this song is very ordinary and nothing at all special . it does feature one of graham coxon 's more agreeable vocals and goes by fine enough . no distance left to run - awful . just plain awful . it never deserved to be a single . it should never have been a single . the lyrics are the most embarrassing i have ever listened to and damon 's voice is just off beyond all point . although i 'm sure those who love this album will point out that it 's supposed to represent the pain he 's going through . it just does n't work . as for the rest of the album it just a horrible mess of styles thrown together to make it sound like they 've been listening to the coolest albums around and that america 's underground is really cool which is ironic given that this band originally wanted to go against all that . people say that blur is graham 's album and this is <NUM> 's album and while i 'm not so sure i 'd label blur graham 's album i can definitely agree with <NUM> being damon 's album . it 's completely self-absorbed and the music is secondary to the theme of the album which in my book is never a good thing . however there are a couple of good songs . bluremi and <NUM> are toetappers and the often underrated optigan <NUM> . poor optigan <NUM> . the optigan is one of the more fascinating instruments and has a gently surreal yet antique way of sound . it 's a credit that this was made . yet it goes almost unnoticed by many because `` oh it 's just an instrumental . '' a shame that , because it sounds like everything this album is trying to be ; emotional , warm , hurt . but most of the tracks here are surrounded in half thought-out ideas , lazily produced songs and in the case of trimm trabb , nicking the opening riff of wined and dined by syd barrett . i once said that this album was a poor man 's bad moon rising ( by sonic youth ) and by god i stick to that statement . while that album had oozing soundscapes , inventive lyrics and a sense of adventure even in dealing with some similar viewpoints ( although not all ) ...... this feels completely lazy , lyrics depressed <NUM> year olds would laugh at , music that does n't really do much and not a lot much else . it 's painful to say that this is the same band who an album beforehand made something that was a stroke of genius . this however is not the answer though . buy this if you are in love with damon 's ego . otherwise , do yourself a favour and buy other blur albums ( other than the great escape and leisure ) or better yet buy sonic youth 's bad moon rising . beats the hell out of this cra

if you 're expecting the same power and intensity of `` scooby doo on zombie island '' or `` scooby doo and the witch 's ghost , '' then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment . it is possible that certain powers felt that the first <NUM> scooby movies were too much for children , but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact , suspense , character development , and even mystery . it may be true that even a medocre scooby movie is better than no scooby movie at all , but this movie is almost boring after `` zombie island '' or `` witch 's ghost . '' well , scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert . fred , daphne , and velmah go on foot for help while scooby and shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion . with their famous and hilarious cowardly ways , they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant . at the restaurant , the gang is surprised that the other patrons do n't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens . we also meet lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area . lester lets the gang stay the night , and scooby and shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens . ' moving on , scooby and shaggy meet amber and crystal , and are attracted to them . they later meet the mechanic buck as well as a team of scientists ( that we already have met ) . unlike `` zombie island '' and `` witch 's ghost , '' the misleads are not really well drawn . also , rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains , we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious . even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story ( in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything ) it 's nothing most people could n't have figured out . i wo n't deny that there are some good moments in this movie . ( for undoubtedly the first time , scooby and shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing ! ) but even the old episodes were usually better than this movie . parents may not have to screen this movie , but it is likely that even children will fall asleep during this one . thank goodness for the eventual `` legend of the vampire '' and `` aloha scooby doo . ''
i ca n't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album . the lyrics must have come out of a dadaist poetry circle , and ( most of ) the guitar work is completely without personality . what is the criterion of a good rock album ? by any standards it must be a joy to play it . 6teen stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional . but it does n't so much incite anger than it does disdain for bush 's attempts to emulate nirvana . where nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist , evocative lyrics , bush has dull , throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger . there 's not much more to say about 6teen stone . i could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like `` swim '' : thinning ice / <NUM> hairdryers / swimming to you / flame on earth desire . '' or the artistic suicide of the last track , `` x-girlfriend '' , a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that 's about six words long . that 's about all i can tell you . mostly i figure i 've done enough warning to let you make your own choice . if you do attempt this though , you ought to be told the little good news that there is : there are about <NUM> minutes of good music are contained on the album , split between `` machinehead '' and `` glycerine . '' the first is an energetic , well-constructed song about control ( you might have seen the music video for it about <NUM> years ago on total request live ) , the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars , a trembling cello , and a surprisingly coherent rossdale . they hold the album ; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building .
i would review it if i got it . come on guys . i placed the order on 1/6/06 .
tim has had better albums . personally i 'm not crazy about thuis one . it 's my least favorite
i started this novel after reading erdrich 's love medicine . while it is clearly not as lyrically written , it is more accessible , and i admired erdrich 's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters . i never finished `` beet queen '' , quitting not that far from the end . when celestine 's child turned out to be so impossible , it was the last straw . `` beet queen '' is just too determinedly bleak , to no higher purpose i could discern or discover in reading reviews here .
this workout ( or should i call it that ) is composed of pieces of all different workouts put together . there is no class , no instructor , forget about cueing , no rhythm - it 's horrible . the abs part is even worse . a kindergartener can do it . <NUM> day abs ? yeah right . i 'm an advanced exerciser and this workout is a nightmare . trust me - do not waste your money
you have ike turner and the king of rhythm as artists for buddha bar viii ? if i were to buy this cd ? would this be accurate artists ? i would suggest amazon check their data base
interesting experimental fiction . in big trouble , barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader is n't sure who the story is about . characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness , leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about -- which is not the psychodelic frog . it 's something less original . the genre is also well disguised . is it a comedy or a thriller ? if a novel is funny , can we take the thriller part seriously enough ? in some cases , yes . when , for example , the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem . in this case , no . it 's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around , chained to an entertainment center , while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy . in all fairness , the novel does feature a ticking clock , which is handy to have in a thriller . it 's more effective if there is something believable about the story . i expected a novel with an overdose of silliness , but i was spared that , which was a plus . no characters with absurdly meaningful names . the nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed . while there was little depth to any characters , that 's probably less of a requirement for characters we want to laugh at . the characters could have used some personality , but that 's a common flaw . the novel should have been funny in places , for a list of situations would show some potential . but i had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout . others would disagree . the politically incorrect portrayal of miami was entertaining , if not actually funny . the overall effect of reading big trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say , `` sir , i know your name is a household word , and i know we could make money on whatever you write , but i have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to ... to something like this . '' if there ever were such days .
if you are looking for a set of w.c. fields shorts or films , do not look at this set . i made the mistake of buying this set and i am thoroughly unhappy with the shoddy quality of this set . i filed a complaint with the manufacturers of this set , passport video , and they have refused to refund me . so do not buy any of their merchandise as their `` no refund '' policy seems to be an across the board business practice with them . save your money and buy a quality film like `` the bank dick , '' or `` it 's a gift .
this recording has a lot to answer for , having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records . i bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies . how has it aged ? not very well , i ` m afraid , the passing years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance . i will not deny that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults . but i can not stomach his pretense that this western diatonic scale rambling is being linked to the actual activity of the chakra system . this is the stuff confusion is made of , and halpern would deserve more than two stars if he simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces , not calling it music with actual ability to heal
i just read _the davinci code_ in less than <NUM> days . i could n't put it down . it was fascinating . then , i put this dvd on and everyone in my family fell asleep ! i tried to keep them interested and have the dvd help explain some of the underlying theories that i found so interesting in dan brown 's book , but the `` expert '' interviews were sloppy and not engaging . when i switched to the extras , hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book , the glimpses of westminster abbey and the louvre were very brief while the rosslyn church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work . i wish they would have held still a little bit and let us look at the place ! i have seen many good documentaries in my life , but this is definitely not one of them
i loved the secret life of bees but i found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting . its difficult to like any of the characters , especially the main character , and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous . it has as much deapth as a harlequin romance novel . the relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly . all in all , a poor follow-up to sue monk kidd 's break out bestseller . do n't waste your time .
hello to all those who have read this book . after reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something . why are you so set against god and christianity ? one of you said this book was what made him rejest christianity . christianity is not some weird religion , it is the faith that jesus christ died for all humans , who he loves so much . where are you going after you die ? christ is waiting for you to call to him and ask for eternal life . the bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down , it is god inspired . there are more manuscripts and texts to prove the bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it . there are more manuscripts than that of homer 's the odyssey , yet we regard that as true . so the gospels werent written right after the disciples were with jesus , but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with christ . i am going to wrap it up now , but if you want to hear the real truth , read god 's word . if you do n't believe that , there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the bible . the age of reason was written by a man who hated christianity . please do not just accept his writing without looking at the bible . jesus christ loves you , and he longs for you to accept him so he can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with him . thank you
you can bet that if peter david had lifted a cliche as hoary as the `` i am spartacus '' moment for one of his stories , he would have at least given a nod to his source ! spock as messiah became fairly tedious , as did the rehash of 'old codger from ost becoming a liability and then proving himself ' plot line from relics . dry , humorless , with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick . i just do n't get why mr. friedman is so popular . i 've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the st fiction offerings in the last few years - kevin ryan , peter david , greg cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit , heart and intelligence . like another reviewer here , i keep trying to like this author 's books since he is so prolific , but damn it , jim , star trek fiction should never be a chore
although i found a few nuggets in this book , i was horrified at the author 's extremist views . i will not recommend this book to the diversity committee at my school
this cd stinks . it 's got the worst music . the only good song is & quot ; this is how we do it & quot ; .do n't buy it
this presentation of mr. boone 's deserves a <NUM> for effort , a <NUM> for the best bad thing i 've ever heard . he made of mess of little richard 's `` tutti fruitti '' way back when . so , in keeping with such destruction , he went after our precious metal hits . funny stuff , though . i keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $ 1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines .
this book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are . for one , i do n't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water , which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists . the author also does n't mention the importance of live rock . in fact , he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks ! sure , you might be able to get away with not using live rock , but it wo n't be worth it in the long run . also , i do n't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations . one more thing , the book lists an air stone as essential equipment , but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep ! if you have enough movement of water at the surface , you should get sufficient gas exchange . there is , however , one thing the book does get right : its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer . this book is easy to understand , but you wo n't be getting the best information
being an avid enthusiast of the drum n ' bass & quot ; scene , & quot ; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is , in listening to this cd i feel this is not a strong representation of the genre . this could very well be personal , ( so you headz chill ) but this type of jazzy , tech-step like , a cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled with .. well ... & quot ; filler. & quot ; i realize that during <NUM> this was where it was at for grooverider . he was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts . this album has a few choice cuts , and his production skills are commendable , but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre is definately an abuse of power . the loungy progressions are worn thick , and lacking any true creativity deep down . this album comes nowhere near stuff on the & quot ; prototype years & quot ; ep which was showcasing the fine talents of heavy hitters dillinja , ed rush , fierce , lemon d , optical , and boymerang , to name a few . it goes without saying that grooverider has been one of the most respected and talented dj 's , probably getting all of these afforementioned producers their starts . a big name gets alot of support and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom . no one would dare defy that grooverider 's attempt at making d n b is off key , but let 's not give in to someone 's production skills because they are graciously empowered in the scene like a king . purveyor 's of fine drum n ' bass can find sanctuary elsewhere . stick with your records for the best
the character , tree is a <NUM> year old.who is <NUM> feet <NUM> inches . he feels that he stands out of the crowd . he spends most of his time helping people . his parents are divorsed . tree has a hard time over this . it is very hard for him to swith from house to house each week . tree enjoys taking things apart to see what they are really made of . his granpa has to have surgey because he was hurt in the vietnam war . his grandpa teaches tree a lot of lessons in this book . tree meets a new friend named sophie , he tris to help her with being teased at school . i learned alot of lessons from reading this inspiring book . tree is a very mature for his age . he learns to overcome his size and think of himself as regular person
one of the most powerful and disturbing movies i have ever seen . thank god for the canadians . i doubt this could have been made in america . but it was disturbing . i grew to literally hate some of the people in thia movie and had to shake off what i felt when they found it was time to pay the piper . this should be required watching for all straight people . maybe then they would figure out that pediphiles are not gay . there is a vast difference between gay males and pedophiles . anyway , i can not recommend this movie strongly enough . the acting and the group of people who directed and produced this movie were very brave in doing so . this is a taboo subject in the u.s. once again , thanks to the canadians and the european 's who do make this type of movie . gary in az
`` envy '' is a hard book to pin down . in a nutshell , we have will moreland , a new york therapist who has elected to go to his college reunion . his wife carole prefers to stay home since she does not know anyone and they are still feeling the emotional tug of the loss of their son , luke . during the reunion , most people are more concerned with the whereabouts of his twin brother mitch , a pretty famous long-distance swimmer , whom will is estranged . after reading about some of his former collegiates , he comes across the bio of former flame elizabeth and discovers that she has a daughter that could possibly be his . when he asks her , she justifiably balks at him . he returns home , and seeks out a therapist of his own to discuss his intimacy issues with his wife , as well as his dark sexual fantasies , as they are starting to interfere with his effectiveness at his own practice . he is also having problems with the abandonment of his twin , who he has not seen since his wedding day . mitch was born with birthmark that made him stand out to ridicule as a child . will always felt guilt that his own face was not marred . little does he know that the brother that he protected since childhood made a mockery of his devotion , as he slowly learns the truth behind mitch 's absence . a new patient arrives in his office with her own intimacy issues . she is a student and seduces older men . when she relishes in telling him about her sex life in detail , it is evident that her next victim is going to be will . after she makes an inappropriate move on him , he decides to terminate their relationship and refers her elsewhere . soon , she is knocking down his door , insisting that he see her . when she disrobes , will 's own lack of willpower triggers a sexual escapade which he will forever wish did not happen , particularly when the patient reveals who she is . suddenly will questions is own relationship with his wife , former lovers , his brother , and his parents . this really could have been a moving story , but i did not feel a connection in any way to the storyline - there was no real emotion , depth , or character development . the revelation of the student 's identity is no surprise - anyone can se that coming . all told in a matter-of-fact manner , with little emotion , the story never has any clear resolution , nor any closure , making it a bit of a disappointment
maybe frankencrist if you really enjoy fresh fruit .... this is a very annoying and bad b-sides album ... california uber alles and holiday in cambodia are over-produced and watered down ... and where is the killer intro to holiday in cambodia ? yeah i like jello biafra 's voice and his mixture of funny and scary themes hit the spot , but this album consists of b-sides for a reason ... aka they werent good enough to go on anything else
do n't get me wrong . i love the story . i 've seen it in the cinema in the <NUM> 's and i still love it . but the issue why i gave low ratings is because of the dvd . this is the first time i 've seen a dvd where the makers of it , puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie . talk about advertising ! second , on the cover , it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer . the only thing that i think , where the movie got it `` digital transfer '' is from a poor quality vhs tape to dvd . this is absurd ! even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording . i 've watch other sonny chiba 's movies from the <NUM> 's in dvd format like ninja wars and gi samurai aka time slip and both quality is what a dvd should be . this one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man . the first <NUM> reviews , refers to other movies and not the one in question . to amazon , please remove this item from your listing .
i chose this film thinking it would be mel gibson when he was still good . yes , he was good , but i 'd seen it many years ago , when i was still at school , and did n't remember . until i was watching the film and thinking that i 'd already seen this before . i had an inkling that i 'd already seen it , when the girl jumped off the building ( i think i had a moan about why she had to be almost topless the first time round ) and then mel gets out of bed . i definitely remember that scene ! damn . the thing about watching lethal weapon now , is that it 's been either spoofed too many times or it 's been copied so many times . almost every 80s cop movie is like this . good cop , bad cop . neither wants a partner . then they realise they ca n't work without each other . and it spawns some mediocre sequels . in the case of the spoofing , see loaded weapon , with emilio estevez and samuel l jackson . there was nothing particularly stand out about this film - apart from mel 's hair , which was just awful - i liked the pairing of mel & danny , and i liked the albino gary busey , playing a bad guy , who does n't even flinch at his arm getting burnt with a lighter . ouch . the guy about to commit suicide from the top of the building and then having mel 's character handcuffed to him was the stand out scene for me , not including the opening scene . the reason i 'm only giving this <NUM> stars ( which is n't going to go down to well with some reviewers ) is because if i 'd seen it when it originally came out , i probably could have given a higher rating . but we 've seen it all before these days , and yes , it may have been a brilliant movie then , but not so much for me . for me , i would like to see another sequel to this . maybe mel could grow his hair again ? i mean , there is another indiana jones on the way , and another die hard . lets revive lethal weapon shall we ? you 're never too old , as harrison ford is proving and mel and danny are both younger . they could still do it . could n't they ? maybe mel could save his reputation . most reviewers consider this a classic , but in my case , it was worthy of a watch , but i do n't remember being that impressed by it the first time round . ( so much so that i did n't realise i 'd already seen it ! ) if you saw it the first time , relive the happy memories , and watch it on hd , cos it amazing . ( bearing in mind i did see it on video , so anything is better than that .
while this story is truly an essential writing of dostoevsky , it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy . if you are interested in reading `` the grand inquisitor '' without reading the rest of the brothers karamazov , i would recommend the guignon edition , sold for only a little more . this work includes the two chapters preceeding `` the grand inquisitor '' as well as what dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale , `` the russian monk , '' which follows this legend . dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole , but i think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy . additionally , this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by charles guignon , which is much more informative than the brief one by anne fremantle provided in this copy . it is important to remember that `` the grand inquistor '' was not dostoevsky 's final answer in the brothers karamazov . reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both dostoevsky 's writing and philosophy and the brothers karamazov . i would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [ and i particularly recommend the pevear and volokhonsky translation for that : it is much more accurate to the original russian ] . or at a minimum , reading the other edition of this book . either way , you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of dostoevsky , which this fails to provide . the grand inquisitor is truly an essential read , but not in this presentation of it
i 'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible . they are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers . i guess this lil one wants to be a `` hip hop teeny bopper '' . well guess what ? you do n't get teeny bopper reviews , you get grown up one 's . please stop rapping and go to college ( or work as a mechanic ) like a normal kid should
this movie was very much like american beauty , except it was a little better . this kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern american life . but for all other people , including myself , fight club was not that good . and i get the movie . i am a consumer , like most americans . but not to a degree where i can relate to jack who is the main character . starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one 's identity is an absurd idea . what is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of fight club . no wonder the only people that joins the fight club in the movie are white males . no wonder that the only real people in my life that i saw raving about this movie so far has been all `` white men '' . the movie does speak one truth . modern american life has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans . like i said , i have not come to that point yet and i do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful . people should build a family , serve their community , and make real friends to live a happy and significant life . fight club is not necessary unless you really became like jack . do not watch this movie unless you are white male . watch if you are really curious , but it will be a waste of time
this book is exactly the same as `` handbook of technical writing '' by same authors . the only difference is in the cover picture and colors . i think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it . so if you have that one , do not buy this one . they are exactly the same
hope edelman 's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study . she has chosen a narrow scope for her research , and that 's fine -- that is , until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics ( such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers ) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them . the second hole in edelman 's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones -- where the basis for this statement ? i 'll believe it when i see it . it 's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships ; what 's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just do n't matter as much . within the context of her thesis , they are not as significant , but this is something that edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she did n't write about them because they are not as significant . other than these two crucial holes , edelman 's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family , both from her own life and from her case studies . it 's worth a read , not so much for its actual insights , but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own
this novel won the pulitzer prize in <NUM> ( for whatever reason ) which the author refused to accept ( maybe he agreed with some of the reviews ) . the author later won the nobel prize in literature in <NUM> . the novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state , going to a fictional university , etc . i may get jumped on by some people for saying so , but personally i found the story dull and tedious ( a good cure for insomnia ) . it does not compare with other prize winning novels which i have read that were written during the same era ( pearl buck 's `` the good earth , '' booth tarkington 's `` the magnificent ambersons , '' etc. ) . i suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student , but i would not recommend it to anyone else . if you have an interest in the author , i would suggest trying one of his other novels
this comic is one to be careful of ! it is displayed and sold linked to harmless pin-up type cartoon comics but it is actually a very graphic cartoon pornographic publication . not one for the squeamish or easily offended !
overall the book ( if you can call it that ) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner . it teaches you how to develop persuasion . the trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just <NUM> pages . the information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books
after listlening to this cd a couple of times and watching dr. know play with brandon cruz i think that this cd is worth every penny.if you call yourself a dr. know fan and dont own this cd then you should slap youself right now.it doesnt matter if its not kyle toucher its still dr. know and they kick ass and brandon cruz is a cool guy.also the metal stuff that kyle did kicks ass too , if you are a fan then you should check that out too
receivied cd in what appears to be a scratched condition . cd wo n't play well in my vehicle ... almost appears to be a book leg version . not happy with item
i just ca n't understand who thinks this guy has any talent ! really ! so many other funny guys ... and this hack is the guy that is popular ? ? ? ! ! avoid this cd ... wasted my money
let me just say that , while i do n't own the album , i did buy it for my wife . she loves it . that does n't say too much for her taste in music , though . she also loves akon ... i was born and raised in tallahassee . i listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b . gave , where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket , and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out . that he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the capital city . there are a couple of issues with that . like mainly the fact that he was n't first , or even in the top <NUM> . you may have to go back a little ways , but all you really need to do is check out a dead prez song called ( of all things ) `` tallahassee dayz '' . stic.man himself went to rickards high school on tally-ho 's south side . so , he ( t-pain ) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself ( again , and again , and every time they play his damn songs ) . oh , three more things : <NUM> ) that video he claimed he shot in tally was shot in atl , <NUM> ) i would n't have given this any stars if i could 've avoided it , and <NUM> ) i do n't know what he 's talking about , but there ai n't no strip clubs where i 'm from ..
what a disastrously bad and unfunny novel . the self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny , the `` plot '' is see-through and cliched , and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog . when people criticize chick lit , this is exactly the kind of book they 're talking about . it 's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously , or stretches for a literary flourish , it 's absolutely cringe-worthy . i find it hard to believe the people who 've praised it here actually read the same book . this was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement . she said she did n't really like it but thought it would be `` more my kind of thing . '' obviously not a person who knows me well . thankfully , it does n't appear the author is terribly prolific , so readers do n't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing . i would n't say it 's one of the worst books i 've read , but it 's certainly one of the most useless
the singing is terrible on `` fly me to the moon '' . do n't take my word for it . listen to the free sample supplied by amazon.com . at <NUM> seconds into it , when she sings `` all i worship and adore '' , she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it . the rest of the pieces sound fine
reading this pamphlet is one way to spend <NUM> minutes . however your <NUM> minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more `` meat '' on japanese carriers
i grew up listening to bob dylan , and was really looking foward to his his new dvd , modern times , and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus dvd in two dvd players i have , and lent it to a friend to try , and neither one of us could get it to play.i should have returned it , but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play , as stated , i was just disgusted . i desided not to order any more music dvds from amazon.i must say that the music on the first dvd was great , starting with thunder on the mountain , it was good to listen to some new dylan .
i listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong . her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce . billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra . fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang . you make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless . the one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this
visuals are stunning , editing is superb - so if you need a visual guide to the bible , this is pretty good . unfortunately , that is where the good ends . bruce feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books , but the trip has an inherent weakness - mr. feiler is a skeptic . he is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes . for example , ascending the mt . ararat , where the bible says the ark of noah rested ; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place . he wonders - melting ice-caps ? in other words , bruce feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the great flood ! if bruce feiler believes that there was a garden of eden as the bible says ( his very first stop ) , then he must also believe that god made the heavens and the earth , as the bible says ! if he can create the heavens and the earth by the word of his mouth , he can also perform miracles . you can not pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the bible is true in its entirety , or it is not . if it is not true , then it does not need bruce feiler 's help to prop up its so-called `` stories '' . this aspect of bruce feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing . why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your guidebook ? more examples ? bruce feiler suggest that since the sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the bible says crossed over from egypt , therefore the numbers must be wrong . how about the manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in sinai ? i could go on .... but you get the point . after a while , this becomes very annoying . if you are a believer , this is not for you . i would not recommend it for my children .
although in some ways provocative , this book poses a question it never adequately grapples with -- namely , can the `` materiality '' of race be properly characterized or understood as a `` discursive limit '' to ideological constructions of ethnicity without being understood as existing outside of discourse ? it seems to me that eng fails to address the question of whether such constructions may be regarded as either a pre- or extra-discursive `` hard kernel of the real , '' one the one hand , or simply another aspect of discourse , on the other hand . his work would benefit from a more thorough engagement with , and analysis of , the `` objet petit a '' in the work of zizek and lacan . perhaps `` race '' in general ought to be regarded a primordial psychic `` hole , '' an `` absence '' or pure negativity where a `` grounding '' for discourse ought to be but proves to be lacking . unfortunately that is a proposition that eng hints at but does not explore .
i love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and i liked 'it 's goin ' down ' when i heard it on the radio . however , i just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'dope boy magic . ' when i heard him rap about 9/11 i was immediately turned off and enraged . how could he rap about something that tragic ? ! does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records ? ! hopefully not ! this is disgusting ! i hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'dope boy magic ' ( and more than likely others too , but i did n't stick around to listen ) before purchasing to see for themselves what a sob this guy is .
here 's the scoop : the stories and essays in the book are hilarious , but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing , and others have been added . that 's only part of the problem . david sedaris narrates , and he has a very monotone voice . if you sit there and listen carefully , you 'll find the stories quite funny , but if you ( like me ) do mindless tasks while listening , you 'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort . then you 'll have to go back and listen over again , only to tune out the next part . amy sedaris has small voice parts in the stories , and her voice is much better at grabbing attention . however , her parts are very small . i wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate , because then this audiobook would be a gem
absolutely do not buy this video . <NUM> ) the fights are not fights . they are boring and tiresome staged tapping , pushing and pulling matches . nobody wants to hurt anyone , and nobody wants to get hurt . <NUM> ) jerry springer fights are <NUM> times better than anything on this video . these girls keep their clothes on , and tussle like 4th grade girls at a sleepover . <NUM> ) modelfight.com has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they do n't fight . <NUM> ) the most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say `` you better get out my room ! * smiling * * no , you get out ! * says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed . complete waste of time and money . you want chick fights , look elsewhere .
for a 2-cd set this should have about twice as many songs on it with a ton more atrists . good stuff , but not enough of it
the searchers are still touring and i saw them last year in bay shore , new york state . this album here is fine , but the group 's work is much more worth getting into . we need the biggest most complete set possible . it is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs : the world is waiting for tomorrow , lovers will , all a dream , till i met you , and so many more . buy this if it 's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your searchers appreciation ! and do n't forget to read frank allen 's memoir of the group 's history . it 's fun
inspector : deux deux , we place loser gangsta rapper juvenile under arrest . deux-deux : what are the charges inspector . inspector : first , he trashed our president and fema on get your hustle on . deux-deux : that is treason . inspector : rodeo and the rest of this album degrades women ( rodeo ) , glorifies violence and praises chronic and looting ! deux-deux : in addition , he advocates domestic violence , robbery , murder and illegal substances . inspector : finally , he degraded his own fans at a record launch party by a ) telling a girl at his album release party that `` he did n't give a f -- k about her and none of ya 'll b * tch * s and just want you to support my music and buy it '' showing he is a greedy money hungry thug , b ) this loser got into a confrontation with a female at the club exposing him for being an insensitive hypocrite and finally got into a fistfight with a white dj . deux-deux : proves he is a bonafide racist ( like kanye west ) with a very nasty and abusive attitude . if you want rap , buy run-dmc or the fat boys
my god , this is one sloppy mess of a movie . jet li should be ashamed of this putrid turd . even the great fight choreographer , cory yuen , can not escape being associated with this film untarnished . the story is dumb , but so what . the acting is dumb , but so what . the pathetic attempts at comedy fail abysmally , but so what . this is a martial arts film ; we watch these films for the fight scenes , right ? uh-huh . unfortunately , the fight scenes suck too , big time . the scene where jet takes on the ufc guys is embarrassingly bad , and the much anticipated fight between jet li and the great mark dacascos is a huge let down . someone needs to tell editors that cutting back and forth between several action scenes absolutely ruins the flow and impact of all of them ! ( this is the same bad decision that has ruined the climax of so many of the star wars films , but in this case , all of the action scenes going on are downright awful . ) further , dmx is just plain silly , and his nice-guy act in the film does not mesh with the meaning of the lyrics of his songs that accompany some of his character 's actions on screen . similarly , i wonder what jet would say about some of the lyrics to some of the crap rap songs in this film , such as the violent and hateful opening song featuring the whiny , smarmy voice of eminem -- jet is supposedly a devout buddhist , after all , who is very opposed to violence . all-in-all , this is one big stinking mess of a film . even as bad martial arts films go , this one has little-to-no entertainment value whatsoever at all . it 's so bad that exit wounds stands far above it ! watch unleashed or kiss of the dragon instead , both of which are infinitely superior to this steaming pile of dog crap
although claiming to be a study of human-animal relationships , this book offers an endless recital of man 's inhumanity to man , to support the book 's theme that man 's history with animals has been even worse . very poorly thought out and extremely long-winded , this book reads like an overblown usenet message -- & quot ; those other people are all so horrible , but we animal lovers are ok , are n't we ? & quot ; oddly , serpell seems so rooted in the very & quot ; human supremacist & quot ; philosophy that he rails against , that he ends up reinforcing that very philosophy . not enlightening at all ; i feel like a pall has been cast over my relationships with both people and animals . you would learn far more by taking the money and time you might waste on this book , and spending them on your own dog or cat or whatever animal you please
macbeth v.v 25-30 : `` a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . '' stream-of-conscieness technique ( no punctuation ) , southern accents ( no spell check ) , mixed and matched timecrawls ( flashbacks without warning ) , sequencing narrators ( voice change with no scene break ) , first and third person viewpoints ( confused yet ? ) , and slapped-your-faceee ! symbolism . for literature , i choose hemingway ( who can be subtle or direct , but is always clear ) . good books should be enjoyable and understandable . i understand the story faulkner was trying to tell about a jerry-springeresque southern family , but i did n't like the novel . if you want to enjoy dsyfunctional american families with blistering social commentary watch 'south park ' -- much funnier . i 'll let one of faulkner 's contemporaries speak : `` poor faulkner . does he really think big emotions come from big words ? he thinks i do n't know the ten-dollar words . i know them all right . but there are older and simpler and better words , and those are the ones i use . '' -- ernest hemingway unless you are forced into this book for a literature class , do n't buy it and do n't read it . if you look hard enough , anything can become meaninful , even this tripe . victor hugo , shakespeare , and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already . you do n't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works . faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you 'll find all over this classical work
of all of james patterson books he has written and i have read , this is the most disappointing one of all . had i known beforehand what this one was about , i would not have bought or read it . sorry , j.p. is too good a writer to put out this kind of trash . just my opinion ! ! ! !
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert . ( ...
this is another hollywood costume epic . they spared no expense with the set and costumes , hired talented big name actors rex harrison , liz taylor and richard burton . despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive . harrison was terrific as gaius julius caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and richard burton does not come across as a great mark antony . his character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by cleopatra , antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked ? although the film is titled cleopatra , it focuses more on the historic events . the film also reduces cleopatra to the woman depicted in octavian 's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent , a gifted political strategist , expert linguist , dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty . they do n't give you sense of what was so compelling about cleopatra . she is depicted as a combative shrew with both caesar and antony . i doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man . if you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here ? i would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as roman military leaders and the weak position of egypt compared to rome . given the limitations of their vision of cleopatra liz taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish , beautiful , seductive and glamorous temptress ; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance . although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you ca n't deny taylor 's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material . although taylor shines sadly we never get to know cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed hollywood costume drama . this movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance ; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the <NUM> 's and sixties - the style reminds me of demille films like the ten commandments . it did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of taylor and burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit . the research , writing and the directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama . the real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great .
this is not a good product for someone as talented as dr. smith . poor arrangements and uninspired playing . saving the cd somewhat are the tunes trouble man , willow weep for me and freedom jazz dance
personally , i found this workout extremely difficult to follow ; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood . after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand , i grew frustrated . other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition , as i have obviously tried , but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill , both of which i believe are integral to any workout . and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output ; one should n't have to teach themselves the moves . to a less significant degree , i agree with the reviews that comment on the `` cheesiness '' of the video . at first , such cheesiness made me laugh , and then as i grew frustrated , it merely made me further annoyed . what i feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor marie forleo 's unsuccessful motivation attempts , which are not only redundant , but suggestive in a most unnecessary way . i do n't mean to sound so aggressively negative -- i just wish i had been able to learn the moves , because they did look like fun
after hearing `` i 'm n luv ( wit a stripper ) '' i do n't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this cd in its entirety . i 'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this cd sucks . this cd is a waste and t-pain is illiterate . there ! i said it in one sentence . holllaaa
dissapointing after `` image of the invisable '' . the rest of the disc is slow . i understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it , which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd , but i 'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another artist in the ambulance or illusion of safety . did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album ? maybe the songs will grow on me , but they will never feel like the good old stuff
shortcut to nirvana : if you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic india , this is perhaps a good movie to watch . i was dissappointed ! this film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the kumbh mela . pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons ! these `` other diversions '' are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations . the story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me
i actually had this on my shelf for <NUM> or <NUM> years . i tried to watch it a time or <NUM> and just could not get past the first <NUM> or <NUM> minutes . i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night . let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in . she did a great job , as always , just poor script writing . it leaves a lot of questions unanswered , such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms , etc . this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point ? i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed ...
this video is just boring . the picture is not to good but watchable . i hope this is the only video this guy ever makes . i do have to give it <NUM> stars just because it does show a lot of stuff . they maybe should explain more
this is a ridiculous dvd as it only has class on one side of the body . it 's insane to have rewind between every movement to be able to do the other side . nobody in their right mind should buy this ; a total waste of money .
i got the above title from another vender and they were not able to send this one and this is absolutly the best rockabilly on record/cd . columbia records was not known for their rock and roll in the <NUM> 's and if this is not rock and roll i do n't know what is . get this cd and the companion `` ai n't i 'm a dog '' . you 'll be glad you did
i obtained this book with the hope that it would build on the themes i encountered in another book i 'm reading ( destructive trends in mental health ) . as a practicing experimental psychologist , i have observed first hand the strengths and weaknesses of the field of psychology . unfortunately , mcintyre failed to deliver . first , the book is short on ideas and repeats them often . having biases is bad ( he scapegoats religious and political ideologies ) . social scientists are n't brave enough ( the author seems to idolize galileo and darwin ) . social scientists whine too much ( about how * hard * their science is - my whining is in the next paragraph ) . social scientists need to look at the data instead of relying on armchair theorizing . people do n't really want to understand human behavior . yep , i think that 's about it . now , repeat this in as many ways as possible and you can stretch it into a very short book . the author turns a good word and thus the book is an easy read ( thus the two stars ) . as much as i might agree with some of his points , he overstates them ( he caricatures social scientists as ignorant ideologues uninterested in data ) and misses many important ones regarding the challenges of the field . if i had as much control over humans as physicists and chemists have over their subject matter , things would be a lot easier . so-called `` hard '' scientists do n't have to ask the subjects of their inquiry if they want to participate in their experiments . they also have much greater control of extraneous variables ( can i * please * be allowed to raise humans in the lab ? ? ? can i * please * be allowed to run experiments on societies , governments , races , companies , ... by changing their laws , rules , structures , income , etc . to my hearts content ? ) . the book would have been much less repetitious if he would have seriously considered the other challenges facing the social sciences instead of assuming that they 're all easily surmountable . hint : think weather prediction and you 'll better understand the challenges of the social sciences . the author needs to check his own biases at the door - it 's obvious that he 's a liberal atheist ( as he was free to admit ) . in sum - read the second paragraph of my review and you 've gotten the gist of the author 's message . skip the book .
you see the name andrew lloyd webber and assume it ca n't be horrible right ? wrong ! when i put this cd into my player i was horrified . some of the music was ok , but most of it was awful and cheesy . the london cast putting on southern accents are really bad . the lead character swallow , has a voice made for a high school production , but not a soundtrack like this . this is not typical alw , musical theater , or good music . this is good milk gone sour . i do however like the voice of the character amos ( pronounced in this cd as ay-moss ) which is why my favorite song is `` tire tracks and broken hearts '' i suggest this for collectors , and alw fans , but do n't expect the normal , this is a new rock-christian alw .
to call this the best of fleetwood mac is a little far-fetched -- it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974 , forgetting the songwriting of peter green , danny kirwan , and bob welch .. it is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era -- the title should have read-fleetwood mac-the best of stevie nicks and lindsey buckingham . i am not knocking this lineup and i love the songs but my favorite is fleetwood mac -- the blues -- the roots . i suggest the then play on album to get a really good idea how fleetwood mac was before stevie and lindsay .. also , do not forget bob welch and mystery to me album -- another gem ! ! !
while it 's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name , the who 's that girl ? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair . due to madonna 's incredible popularity , this disc managed to hit the hot <NUM> 's top ten and reach platinum status in sales , but it 's far from a must-own now . madonna contributes four tracks , and they all sound like true blue out-takes . madonna wrote the big hit `` who 's that girl ? '' ( # <NUM> pop , # <NUM> adult contemporary , # <NUM> dance ) with patrick leonard , and it 's a virtual rewrite of their own superior `` la isla bonita . '' the wistful ballad `` the look of love '' ( also co-written with leonard ) is less derivative , but much more ordinary . the frantic , steve bray-produced dance track `` causing a commotion '' ( # <NUM> pop , # <NUM> dance ) fares much better , and is an undervalued gem in madonna 's singles catalogue . the only other madonna cut ( the generic `` ca n't stop , '' also produced and co-written by bray ) is an obvious throwaway , yet it is still better than any of the other non-madonna tracks . the remaining cuts are by other `` artists '' ( i use that term loosely ) and are anonymous and unlistenable . there 's a reason why duncan faure and coati mundi never went anywhere .
`` i do n't want it '' is the stupidest , most distasteful song ever . do n't tell people how to have sex goddamnit ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
what is with the echo ? ? ? it is terrible . however , the music is great . it really upsets me . i saw them open for pearl jam and i thought the echo in the mic was a bad sound system , but when i listened to the album i realized he did this on purpose . why ? it could have been great
i was unable to play in my car cd player , so only choice i got is to listen at home using my home dvd player .
although fantasies were given by & quot ; regular & quot ; people , i found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you 'd do to your baby neice , not only objectionable , but just plain gross . i do n't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies . based on other reviewers here , i thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic escaapades . i had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly . i think there were <NUM> i liked , but they were just so-so . i wonder about an author that provides a forum for such material
great list with original artists . i ca n't believe they are selling the soundtrack with remakes . looks like i 'm off to itunes to see if i can find all these songs . thanks again
by far one of the worse albums <NUM> come out the south since , well since i can remember , garbage , on the highest level , i actually took the cd back to best buy , walked up to customer service and told them they can have it back and keep the money . if u are trying to be rich , u need to come up with a better game plan cause u sure didnt put effort in this peice of work . u want to be a rich boy , i want to be a rich man , now how rich is that
they started so good , with the album & quot ; pocket full of kryptonite & quot ; and goes on with this . thats hurt in my har
would the woman writing under joyce carol oates ' name these days please return america 's greatest living author to us ? seriously , this was the most unenjoyable , in fact most distressingly bad , book by oates i 've read , among the maybe thirty i have had the utmost pleasure to read . i do n't know what vein oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all , the stories themselves are unimpressive , unwelcoming , unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration . and worse still , i find this is a trend with oates these days . i ca n't think of a single book she 's published since middle age that has been ( yes , strictly in my opinion ) any good . the short story in female of the species that was called `` madison at guignol '' was perhaps the worst oates story ever published . ( and yes i do understand the connotation of the word `` guignol '' in the title . ) some might accuse me of approaching oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what i , myself , wanted , but that 's not the case . one thing i have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people . i have avidly read along thru gothic stories , mysteries , romances , non-genre pieces , novellas , poems , short fiction , novels , literary criticism and plays by oates , and so i believe i can fairly say i do not stereotype joyce carol oates or expect any one thing from her , but in this case , as much as reporting it pains me , this was a bad book and i can only hope oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has , and that her next book ( s ) will be much better
yes , indeed ! the booklet included is nice and glossy . thanks ! and the two documentaries added this time around are nice too . thanks again ! but what about the film itself ? has that been given the deluxe treatment as well ? sad answer : definitely not ! as a matter of fact , this new `` re-master '' looks much worse than the previous dvd . that one was a very fuzzy non-anamorphic mess , but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy . in fact , when i put the old one in the zoom mode , there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever . and the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition . but worst of all , is that the new dvd is cropped on all four sides ! there is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc , especially on top of the frame ! so much for a deluxe edition ! shame on you , sony/mgm-ua ! fans of this film - myself included - will have to keep the old dvd , and get this new one for the extras and the booklet . ( the <NUM> stars above are for those inclusions alone . ) this is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film
can `` miss ross '' let someone else produce her albums ? she made some all time greats in the past when someone else was producing . she has great talents , a good voice although it 's aging , but that 's fine . this album made me listen to it once , and sadly put it away
henry morris is neither a scientist nor a theologian . he 's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who 's obsessively promoted the 7th day adventist doctrine of a `` young earth creation '' far outside the sda denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches . he 's since gone on to promote the `` king james only '' cult group which further seeks to spread 7th day adventist false doctrines among baptist fundamentalists , and even promoted a sort of astrology among christians ! jesus said we 'll know them by their fruits - morris ' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the earth , and seekers convinced that the bible is n't true because of morris ' bizarre interpretation of genesis . morris deserves nothing but a firm , unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the bible , slandering other christians ... and lying about science
i like self-reference jokes . i enjoy them quite a bit , actually . but this book beats you over the head with it . i wanted to read the whole thing , just so i could feel like i had a more informed opinion than i would otherwise , but i got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better . i see a lot of reviews full of praise here , but for me reading this was incredibly tedious . he lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on the real world . the only reason i gave this book two stars was because i did n't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we 're shown how arrogant the main character is . but i do n't really care , i hated it .
i read this book for school , my sister said it would get better , but it turned out to be the worst book i 've ever read . i rest my case .
why ? ... words , lover 's prayer , to love somebody ... why ? i was pleased to hear juliet again but resinging barry 's leads is a mistake . would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to mo instead . when i look at this album , all i can say is `` why ?
i have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio cds from the library . i was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author . he sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in `` w '' - it drives me mad . he reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on . i am a big fan of audio cds because i can listen to the stories while doing other things - i 'm not tied down to the couch . i have listened to many narrators - jim dale for one - and have never hated listening until now . charles frazier may be a `` brilliant '' author , and should stick with writing - period ! leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life
limp bizkit ? metal ? the two go together like when dante met bosh in a crack alley in bogota : a real big mess ... being a true metal fan ( a la , slayer , testament , pissing razors and megadeth ) i find limp bizkit 's excuse for metal as nothing more than a pathetic joke . metal never had rap in it 's fold , and to even attempt to combine the two spectrums together would be disgracing the world of metal ... and i 'm sure rap fans would be equally angry . make up your mind , durst ( your stupidly miniscule mind ) . are you a metaller ? or a rapper ? oh , and i suggest that fred goes back to school so that he can pay attention in his english language lessons so that he might just learn how to spell properly .
powerful voice . mimics the styles of a variety of classic hispanic singers . incredible range of material . but , unlike lhasa de sela or astrid hadad , she leaves me flat
i have often joked that i would rather read umberto eco 's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels . in this book , eco goes to prove me wrong . eco has written a book that is a struggle to read , not because it is deep , complex , and rich but because it is an utter bore . the story tells of the case of yambo , a rare-book dealer living in milan . yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of the man who mistook his wife for a hat . in his case , he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read . curious . but eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect . for example , yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant . yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react . he need not have worried , because like everyone else , she treats him with no mention of the past . yambo 's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets . the end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on . yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories . yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements . `` a lovely snail-shell structure still steaming . '' i was underwhelmed . yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books . but none of this seems to go anywhere . in fact , it seems more like an excuse for eco to discuss ( although not in any detail ) , pre- and post-world war ii italian novels that eco fondly remembers . the book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then i just wished the book would end . i cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through . eco has done much better . if you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that eco is , indeed , fallible . otherwise choose one of his other books instead
i ordered this release last week from amazon and could n't wait to hear it , but when i got it yesterday , i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd , instead of getting <NUM> tracks of music like i was promised , i got <NUM> tracks and <NUM> minutes of spanish ballads ! oh , my lord , what in the world happened ! ? well , i guess you ca n't hear 'em all , can ya ? i 'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time . oh , by the way , the one star is not for the flirts music , for that is <NUM> star material anyway , but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music
this cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced . any <NUM> cd should have better sound quality . like the other reviewers stated , i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately <NUM> minute long each. got ta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer . they could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators . curiously too , where is the nwo 's music
the book has nice full colour pictures of games , and touches the surface of moddeling in 3ds max , but does't work out real examples of modeling . examples of cubes and primitives are all that are supplied , no professional quality buildings or scenes as the cover suggests . not money well spend . recomended book from quake arena modeler paul steed is modeling a character in 3ds ma
this book 'the resurrection ' .. the 'title is a way off does not specify & quot ; the resurrection of 'whom ' what , who ? quite misleading in the 'title ' this book contains a paraphrase legalistic view of someone ? by the name of jesus christ ( inside the book ) who is this someone ? popularistic homogenous personality of the ad ; s era , who resurrected in an abnormal manner , irrational or modelistic super natural sensationalism ? this unequal phenomenon of th ad era does not quite interpret an invasion of ethiologial or methodolagical interpretation in any form or manner . precautiosly , hank h. ( the author ) of this 'strange ' book , depicts a man 2thous years ago who was a 'super-artistic ' human walking around the earth realm announcing and denouncing his own fate , then 'resurrects ' from the dead ? quite symbolic and quite 'phenomenal ' , however , hank h. ( the author ) does not quite inscripts the powers involving this 'super-natural ' heroes of the other decades and eras ad . the author needs more research inside this man called 'jesus-christ ' , how a super-natural power 'raised ' him and made him a 'normal ' human again . this jesus christ , hank portrays , has to have an incontrollable humanistic inside his 'human ' potentials , physically , a human-being ' after burial can not in any form or manner resurrect from the grave . hank h. ( the author ) does not specify in detail 'who resurrected him ' was the power on the skies , .. like imentioned in my first review 'the big bang ? & quot ; resurrected this powerful created who inhabitted the 'earth ' <NUM> thous years ago ? if hank analyzes this 'resurrection ' power inside the 'einstein ' theory ' or the 'carl sagan ' theory ' relativity , and 'rational - irrational ' theory of both scientists . hank h. ( the author ) imiplies about the 'myths ' and other man made theories ... hank h. ( the author ) .. does not quite interprets the nature of this 'human ' called jesus christ in the humanistic form .. or other/ super-=natural-instics of a super-naturla power involved.end * * * * * *
this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times . the owens girls are hereditary witches , any man who loves one is doomed to an early death . there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion , this requires the sacrifice of a dove . two little girls watch . years later they 're grown up . one leaves to live with her boyfriend . but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck ( never stand in the middle of a road ) . we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell `` witch '' , as if to symbolize something . sally goes when jillian calls her ; she has a problem with her boyfriend . but sally uses a `` magic potion '' to eliminate the problem . now jillian wants to undo what was done . [ the film began to lose me now , it was n't funny . ] the spell goes awry , they bury their mistake . then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles . later an investigator comes around looking for jimmy . [ the story drags again . ] more scenes follow ; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining . but a scene in the attic will wake you even if you 're snoozing ! they call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of jillian . it seems to work , even if they do n't use the standard issue witches broom . there is a sort of happy ending . sandra and nicole are good actresses , but they ca n't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . `` bell , book , and candle '' is a funnier film , `` blair witch '' is a scarier film . this falls between the cracks .
sure , this cover can say she looks good and trying to look hot.she 's trying so hard to give off an image that 's not her.she 's being and mostly acts like a tramp.have you seen her videos ? brintey can not break out of her shell and between the rebelious and outrageous lyrics , i see a sad girl being consumed by the media.sure , she laughs and she looks as if she is having a good time on her videos but come on ! briney hides behind her clothes and lyrics and her record deal.it 's all tenn pop lyrics penned down on her notepad while she 's waiting in line ! i am dissapointed and i hope she writes better songs but from the heart , go britney ! britney rock on please !
normally i love documentaries . i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all . however , outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen . a relentless rant against rupert murdoch 's cable news station , this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with fox news , but i can not imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in fox news to remain awake while watching this movie . watching outfoxed makes me realize what a genius michael moore is . whether you love him or hate him , whether you agree with him or not , you have to admit his films are entertaining . this film , however , is a major bore . - regina mcmenami
this book does not go well with the class , i would suggest to any university that is using this book for it <NUM> class , to find a different author .
i do n't see how you can isolate `` the grand inquisitor '' chapter from the novel in which it is situated , the brothers karamazov . i think that knowing who is telling the story , who he is telling the story too , what the story means to each of these people , and what the consequences of what the grand inquisitor have to say , are all important ; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor ! ! ! ! ! ! ! my suggestion : buy the brothers karamazov instead of this . it 's excellent
why do i keep finding that most of the theme songs are written by different artists on other albums ? clubbed for death was done by crystal method , and i know that for sure because it 's on their album
it seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of lucas davenport . i feel that he wants to transplant the best of davenport to a new hero.if so , he failed . if that is the case , he failed . there are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us . worth to read if you can not fall asleep ; after some half a dozen pages , you can . how sad ..
my wife got me this soundtrack a few years ago and i took it straight back . the problem is it 's missing about <NUM> songs that were in the movie , and the b.o.c . song godzilla ( from the album spectres ) is not sung by b.o.c . if all songs were included this would be the coolest soundtrack ever , but it 's not
on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums ( i think it is shaker ) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert . that should have been as far as it went . to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at <NUM> bucks a crack is highway robbery . if these are blues songs , then i am robert johnson 's illegitimate son . `` death letter '' is good , maybe even great , but can not compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard . the rest is a waste of time . the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd . these are my first <NUM> reviews by the way , but all these 5-star reviews for both cd 's finally got me motivated . go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save <NUM> bucks in the bargain
i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my <NUM> year old niece who loves the movie . i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good . i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words . although the music is nice , i know she would not be too impressed . we had seen the movie together and we loved mr. ray 's song and wanted to know the words . it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it
i hate this book . all the book is the repetition of the same code with very , very few differences . the description lets argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that is hard to believe . it uses soap in it 's more basic fashion . the code is poor ( also the html and the javascript used ) . the code is written in a so invesive fashion that if you strip it ( and is not a bad idea ) , you will find no more than <NUM> pages . the multi-tier is just supposed to be good and misuesed . as you may understand , i strongly advise to not buy this book
i have just listened to the samples available online , and being a native spanish speaker , the gramatical errors i have heard hurt my ears . i am also bringing up my baby bilingual english/spanish , and as someone mentioned in a previous review , mixing the two lenguages goes against the expert 's advice , as it creates confusion for the baby
i see that freeman & hackman are executive producers on this stinker . just reaffirms , i guess , that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves . the truth in spades in this case . i think , as i 'm sure millions do , that freeman & hackman are the very best around , but i 've never seen them work with such stiff , stilted pathetically sensationalistic material . on top of which hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like ben kingsley . why oh why did n't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to kenneth branagh to direct them in a dream version of othello
slayer released diablos in musica in <NUM> . this is a decent thrash album , but definitely not up to slayer 's standards . yeah , some people think slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated . these people are entitled to their opinion . that being said , diablos really is slayers weakest album . maybe tom araya was able to sing in <NUM> , but his singing <NUM> years later just ruins the music . his normal vocals are ok , but when he sings or tries a spoken word section , it really shows that he should stick with what he knows ( if only james hetfield took my advise ; his voice makes me want to puke now ) . songs like death 's head , stain of mind , love to hate are probably the worst slayer songs they wrote up to this point . this is the slayer album i listen to the least . there are song good songs : bitter peace , overt enemy , scrum and screaming from the sky . too bad the rest of the album is rather boring .
buying this would not make sense if you a . bought batman the animated series : volume one or b. batman tas the legend begins . if you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have <NUM> and if ur that rare case of ones who bought both a. and b. then you would have <NUM> christmas ' with joker . now i would urge you to buy volume one and later <NUM> then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both dvd 's . be safe and read before you buy
take eugene levy ( puhleez ! ) , his former canadian ( r.i.p . ) sc-tv alum john candy and add 'commando 's ' dir. , harold ramis and ( ! ) james keach ( ! ! ) to the writers and what do you have ? an only moderately funny john candy movie ! there are some great bits in here - but this movie is the greatest waste of space ( make that talent ! ) since greenland ! robert loggia and meg ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles . and levy with ryan ? ! about as bad as billy ( clipper-fan , his only redeeming quality ! ) crystal with ryan ! or tom hanks ! lester did better here than with 'commando ' , but is that really saying much ! ?
waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages . ha jin 's personal accomplishments notwithstanding , this is one of the most overrated books i have read . national book award ? hmmm . waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution , lin , trapped in a loveless marriage . when lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital -- manna wu -- herself the victim of waiting for a man , he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands . everyone in waiting waits ... and waits ... and waits . the book gets its point across , and more or less works as an allegory on the chinese communist state . it lacks any deeply interesting characterization , as manna , and even lin , are both all too childlike ( as the author intends ) . the book also lacks lyricism and elegance , and unforgivable trangression for sucha decorated piece of literature . ha jin 's story educates , but does n't elevate us
this cd is not the music soundtrack from the movie . it 's only some of the music that is in the movie . i was very disappointed . i wanted the original soundtrack of the music you hear when you watch the movie . that 's why i purchased it . is the original soundtrack not available or was it not produced ? i would n't buy this cd again .
i like francois ozon 's swimming pool a lot . i think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie . but under the sand is a very typical french movie which makes most people do n't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a french movie . i finally persuaded my husband that francois ozon is different and this movie will be good , it turned out to be a nightmare , pointlessly soul strangeling movie . i would not recommend unless you are a big fun of ozon or this type of movies
i am stationed in iraq and recently purchased the hunter ( steve mcqueen ) through amazon and when i received it and went to play it , the disk started skipping . i guess this gives me the opportunity to ask what i can do , if anything to return the dvd and get it replaced . my dvd player is new and i have since watched a couple of other new dvds in it with no problem . i have made other purchases through amazon , but this was a really disappointing experience .
this was not a wonderful story , but it was good enough that a kid who already knows he/she has ad/hd would probably enjoy it . it 's about a boy who has problems with impulsivity , forgetfulness , and distracability , but manages to make progress and become a better friend
& quot ; this is absolutely laughable , would you trust a book on christianity by abdul bin majeed the 2nd ? or one on capitalist free thinking by carl marx
my gosh ! ! tina had made <NUM> cd 's of all the best is a waste of money on tina turner . do n't take us wrong we do fond of her but why would she made <NUM> times of all the best ? ! about the same as en vogue ! ! it 's not worth on buying this one because it only has <NUM> songs in this cd ! ! so think twice ! ! the best cd 's you could get is <NUM> sets of cd of all the best it has over <NUM> songs in it it would save you alot of money from buying these <NUM> cd 's for once tho ... just my opinion ! ! honestly for this cd we would give <NUM> star but the other one of all the best that has <NUM> sets of cd 's and has over <NUM> songs in it we would for sure give <NUM> stars for that one !
this guide is probably one of the worst ever . the chapters all look alike . it takes more time to look for what you need in this than to beat the game . the game is pretty simple anyway , so it 's not really needed . if you do need help , find an online strategy guide , but save the $ <NUM> for something more useful
i am currently a medical student , and physiology is on our required texts list . it 's an awful read . very dry , very dense . difficult to keep interested from one scattered clinical tidbit to the next . plus , there were multiple mistakes in just the few chapters i made myself go through . thinking about petitioning for a new text listing for next year 's class ..
what a terrible dvd . i 'm no pessimist , this was recorded horribly . either shannon hoon 's voice is awful or the recording was . i suspect it was the latter . i will admit , i 'm not a hardcore blind melon fan , but i 'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al .. and was very impressed . i read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the dvd . what a mistake . i also bought alice in chains unplugged which is excellent . if you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this . otherwise save your money .
this movie smacks of sub-par quality . unlike its two predecessors which are far superior , blade iii is plagued with a poor script , an unqualified director ( sorry , david goyer is no director ) , and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace . think godfather iii in the godfather series and you 'll know why to bypass this awful film . this movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the blade character in the first two films . without these attributes , the follow-on action and violence in the film ( an artistic staple in the blade franchise ) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you 'd expect . what you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters ( including snipes 's blade ) who are all dressed up with no where to go . rated or unrated , avoid this dvd at all cost . it is n't worth the money or the effort .
many reviewers and critics said it best ... what do you do when the `` hero '' of the film ( ethan hawke ) is a complete a -- -hole , winona ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give ed wood , jr. a run for his money , and stiller , who is supposed to be the bad guy , actually is n't that bad of a human being ? and winona 's friends are the smarmy , arrogant , generation x punks who think they know everything ( when the reality is ( forgive the pun ) they do n't know jack ) . past generations would quote tolstoy and shakespeare , generation x quotes tv commercials , scooby doo cartoons , star wars , and bad sitcoms . generation x is probably the most insincere generation ever , detaching themselves and calling themselves `` ironic '' , when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism . is this film an accurate portrayal of them ? yes , in some ways . is the film worth watching ? yeah , at least once . stiller gives a decent performance , it 's nicely shot , and garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth . this is probably due to the fact that garofalo actually has some substance herself , as opposed to the character she plays . check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film .
yes . wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes . are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot ? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film . candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast ( from oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) can turn candy into cuisine
i could not really enjoy the film . i purchased it recently on vhs and the audio quality was horrendous . i do n't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio , and it is very annoying to follow . do n't waste $ 19.95 on it . watch it on tcm ; even there the audio is distorted . i only got it because it is a very early irene dunne movie , and i was curious to watch it
if you think of the prime numbers as a dr. seuss staircase then this book 's for you . there are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation . it is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of rh books . buy any of the others . avoid this one
i started reading this book , skipping the introduction and then realized this is n't the tao te ching at all . this is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said , and so he wrote his own version . it turns out the author admits this in the introduction . i wish i had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk . i guess i should have taken the hint with the `` a new version '' doublespeak on the front cover . sigh . i usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs .
after all the hype i expected this disc to be great . boy was i wrong . i love the wailing souls but i can not even listen to this . what were they thinking ? ? ? a truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios . the first track , `` row fisherman '' , is such a bad version of a great song . skip this and buy firehouse rock or face the devil . even better try and find a copy of their first ( and best ) lp from <NUM>
this band claiming to be hopesfall is not ! there is only one original member left , they should of changed their name with the release of atypes , no question . atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in nc ! i would have respected them if they changed their band name
milo ventimiglia ( gilmore girls , the bedford diaries ) stars as zack harper , a kid who helps out his friend kyle who is in a bit of a rut . kyle was challenged by a senior to do the dirty deeds . the dirty deeds ( there 's <NUM> of them ) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish . there 's also a record that has never been beating before . so , milo sets out to do the dirty deeds and there 's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many milo has done . not another teen movie ! ! just had to say that but its bascially what it is . in american pie you had jason biggs doing the pie and in this , well milo ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread ( if you know what i mean ) . milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie . more moronic characters . my advice is watch it ( unrated or not ) once and the decisions are up to you . also starring lacey chabert ( not another teen movie , mean girls ) of course , mark derwin ( one life to live , heist ) , zoe saldana ( drumline , pirates of the caribbean ) , panso gorson ( south of nowhere , dear wendy ) , billy l. sullivan ( my life , little big league ) , ray santiago ( meet the fockers , pinero ) , todd zeile ( king of queens , snl ) , michael milhoan ( american gun , pearl harbor ) , erin torpey ( crescendo , one life to live ) , arielle kebbel ( aquamarine , be cool ) , dave power ( frailty , boston public ) and charles durning ( the final countdown , rescue me ) for some odd reason that i dont know why . what does the unrated version have to offer ? female nudity what else ? !
i 've read every one of iris johansen 's `` suspense '' novels and have loved most of them . the last couple though have been so painful to get through . this one however , i do n't think i can even finish . i read where someone called these characters `` cardboard , '' and i could n't agree more . the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist . whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters , it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing <NUM> class . `` now this should happen here , and this here , and this here and boom , climax , happily every after . '' i hope that iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time .
you 'd think the director of the original japanese series could turn out a decent sequel . but nooooooo .... instead , `` the grudge <NUM> '' is a detailed , shimmering example of why people loathe sequels , and how ( with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies ) they are pretty much always bad . overused spooks , lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror . aubrey davis ( amber tamblyn ) learns that her sister karen ( sarah michelle gellar ) is seriously ill , and goes to japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results . karen 's last warning : `` do n't go in that house . '' other people are n't doing the same , since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone 's least favorite croaking ghosts , kayako and toshio . and an american family in chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts , which have somehow transferred out of japan and into the united states . aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of karen 's madness and demise , going to the abandoned house that karen tried to burn down . as the malevolent ghosts close in on them , aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned kayako into an evil force that can not be stopped ... ghosts , ghosts , everywhere , and not one of them is actually scary . apparently takashi shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie , the scarier it becomes . sadly , it does n't work that way -- kayako and toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes , and when they are n't around , other ghosts are popping up for no good reason . all those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline , with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film . the schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable , and the chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable ( and dreaded ) `` grudge <NUM> , '' during which the horror rules get recklessly broken . so only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about kayako . it 's rather sad that gellar is the ruling force here , and she 's only in it for a few minutes total . she 's certainly more charismatic than the tamblyn , who seems to be sleepwalking through her role . ohga tanaka and takako fuji provide some scares as the ghosts , even misused , but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting . `` grudge '' had its flaws , but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it 's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots . cinematically , this is a curse
i was n't expecting much from pulse , and with such low expectations , i was n't disappointed . it was everything a one- or two-star movie could hope to be . what i did find disappointing was that they had a good idea somewhere , but everyone working on the film , top down , seemed to miss it . then again , it was a remake of a japanese horror classic ( and japanese horror films rarely , if ever , make sense ) , so they were n't trying to find an original story . pity . in an otherwise quiet college town , the suicide rate is skyrocketing . eventually our heroes , mattie ( kristen bell ) and dexter ( ian somerhalder ) realize that there is a virus , of sorts , in `` the system '' , and odd , silvery specter-like creatures are the cause of it . these creatures , never explained , put themselves face-to-face with their victims and then it seems that they inhale and suck some essence from their victim , which feeds them - somehow . it makes for good viewing , but it does n't make much sense . and because it does n't make sense , we 're not `` creeped-out '' . since i 'm reviewing this as the dvd , and not the film , i 'm giving it two-stars - because for the first time that i can recall , the special features were subtitled . as i 'm hearing impaired , i normally miss out on the special features , and even though these special features were n't all that exciting , i was able to watch them .
my wife got me this book for xmas thinking it would help . it did n't . it can be distilled down to two points everyone already knows : * selling is job # <NUM> in a startup . forget about every other aspect of the business until you have a steady stream of sales . * do n't take on any fixed overhead until the sales are achieved . thanks for the clarification , guys . * yawn *
eeyucch . sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background . oh look , is n't that wayne newton over there
this band is the funniest thing i have ever seen . go to their website , www.mightyrhapsody.com here you will find why they are so damn funny . these guys actually believe they are dragon slayers ! i ca n't stop laughing at this band ! say hello to medieval metal
mambo # <NUM> caught my ear when listening to the car radio . it is the only passable song on the cd . i could n't even listen all the way through the others . just awful . i paid one cent plus shipping for it used and still feel ripped off by mr. bega .
the most irrattating piece of music i 've purchased in a long time . i was glad to sell it . the phrasing made previous favorites annoying . i do n't think i 'll be buying any more of her music unless it 's for resale on the web
there is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic . there was a japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source ; the intertitles were in russian and japanese ( an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the russian-japanese war of <NUM> ) . the opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam , and of the sailors on their cots , is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in america on any format . if the rumor is true of a <NUM> digital remastering , we have waited three years too long for a quality dvd release . a film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all . eisenstein directed the details , and the better the transfer the more details will be seen . none of current dvd transfers are at all acceptable
i dont feel bad reviews are a good thing , so all i will say is , the picture on the cover is really nice
while some would call orange and acme `` studio '' albums , suggesting that they lack originality , but they have rythm . i would call myself a big jsbx fan , i play orange and acme constantly , however i feel that this album is a little too much free form , and free noise for the everyday listener . i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx , because it is a rather acquired taste
is this a cover of social d 's sick boy ? and if youre looking for a good album , get one of theirs
this collection of <NUM> great hits of nicola di bari in spanish is missing one of his most ( if not the most ) important and popular song : & quot ; lisa de los ojos azules & quot ; . i would n't buy this cd without that song
wow . <NUM> dollars for this cd . i must have seen this album in every stores <NUM> dollar bargain bin , and their was n't one cd their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier
the first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting . perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus . this is not an original plotline , but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl , as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her step-brother . take that for what its worth . there was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie , but then the second movie is not worth it at all . it was a b movie ... which is why it went straight to video . if your a frustrated teen boy , you will love this movie for its sexual content . otherwise , it is greatly overacted and over dramatic
do not buy this product for use in the uk , the hd part will not work from a location outside of the usa , it requires internet access to authenticate your license to view , if this is outside the us then it will not work . if you have a multi region player the standard dvd will work fine , it is only the computer media that require wmv-hd auth .
this movie does not make sense . and it 's not weird in the style of david lynch , it 's just complete crap . i thought willie wonka and the chocolate factory was the worst/stupidest fil ever until i saw this . do not buy this . it is not a family movie , and it is not funny or entertaining
i 'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not cussler 's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his ? way too many characters - i 'm no dummy , but i have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the `` cast of characters '' he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters . the story is n't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are , there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it . i hope it gets better as it goes along , but i doubt it
i know that this review will be followed by several saying that i am stupid and am not aware of how awesome shadows fall is , but i still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion . i was excited for this album , shadows fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment . while it is n't terrible , it just is not good . it suffers the pitfall of many metal releases , all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest . if you do n't believe me , scan through this cd and let me know if almost all ( with the exception of one or two ) are n't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool , then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat , and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory . do n't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience . do n't buy this album if you want something you may replay again . if you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then i guess you should buy this album , but i say take a stand . do n't just buy whatever shadows fall puts out in front of you . the war within was a good cd . the follow up bonus track cd was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this cd is just a group that did n't really try and put out some music . i 'm sorry to all the die hard shadows fall fans , and you may enjoy this album which is great for you , but i really felt like shadows fall underachieved and did n't really put enough into this release . i know they could have done better
i really enjoy doyle lawson and quicksilver , especially their gospel music . this is their first release for rounder records . i suspect the content and flow of this album represents a strong influence by the record company and not the usual freedom which doyle lawson has had in the past to pick the song lineup . perhaps they were just trying to `` break the mold '' so to speak and stay away from heavy gospel content . i 'm not sure where that came from , but to me it causes this release to come across as forced and mechanical rather than natural and flowing . do n't get me wrong , the musicianship and especially the vocals are top notch , but for me this does not make up for the material selected for this release . go back and listen to some of the soulful and sincere music from their previous releases and then compare it to this album . i will be going back to listen to rock my soul and the older dl & q material and you got ta dig a little deeper will probably be a very infrequent visitor in my cd player . if this is how dl & q is going to be with rounder , then in my opinion we would all have been better off without that relationship . - scripto
i ca n't believe that i 'm not allowed to give this zero stars . this band is garbage . the record is worse than garbage . it 's septic sludge . the music is unoriginal , cloying and boring . the vocals are the most annoying sound i 've ever heard . i wish the courts would gag and restrain this band . this band could n't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb . boycott
she has one of the most beautiful voices , and is one of my all-time favorite female singers . this album is terrible though . unlike agnetha faltskog , k.d . lang , and alison moyet , who ( in my humble opinion ) succeeded recently with their `` cover '' albums ( made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past ) , olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs , production , and style of singing these
as the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end , i 'm left unsurprised that classic trek got axed at this season 's end . after a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes ( where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons ? ) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel . the first episode is just very , very poor with terrible scriptwriting and spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms . the overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid . why would n't a force strong enough to send the enterprise <NUM> light years away just simply destroy the enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained . why would the computer have to make replicas of lee meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot . i can safely say that this episode `` that which survives '' is one of the worst <NUM> episodes in the entire classic trekdom . the second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves . the script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be . this episode ranks among the better ones of season <NUM> as well . overall , we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the `` give it a miss '' category if you are deciding which volumes to collect .
zandalee , zandalee , zandalee . where do i start ? well , i watched this movie on cable a couple of times when i was still a child , and i remember it being a good but forbidden movie . i decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic . but watching it as an adult has shown me one thing : it 's bad in every way . from the bad louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by nicolas cage to the pedestrian acting by ericka alexander to the silly script writing . it 's very bad . even the s/ex scenes are not as good as i remembered : a couple come off as rape scenes , which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with consentual desire already . i guess my changing view about zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a <NUM> year old versus that of a <NUM> year old . bottom line : no wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it
the production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music . do n't be fooled folks . the `` artistic '' hacks may love it , but beauty is truely in the eye of the beholder . if you enjoyed the awesome first <NUM> soundtracks ; do n't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same . instead you will receive a cd chocked full of unimaginative ( i.e . high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers ) techno and `` spoken word '' type lyrics that are laughably bad ( but only if you did n't shell out $ 13.99 to listen to them ) . i 'm now the proud owner of a $ 14.00 coaster , b/c that 's about all it 's good for
i wanted to like this album , but it simply does n't compare to leftism . leftism was way ahead of it 's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas rhythm & stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to . this is my synopsis and apparently i 'm not alone as this cd sells for much cheaper on the used market than leftism . my advice ? do n't miss leftism but skip rhythym & stealth
i generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films , while trying to be cutting edge , usually smack of just `` trying '' ... too hard . i gave `` the hamiltons '' a go since it received the most hype . was n't impressed . yes , the ending has a nice little twist , and i was intrigued by seeing lenny -- although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming -- the film lacks dramatic tension , contains mundane dialogue ( victim : `` help me '' ; predator [ whining ] : `` i ca n't ! ) , and characters are pretty much stock caricatures . <NUM> minutes drrrraggged by .
when i was first chosen to narrate this book , i knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- i knew only that it was the single worst book i 'd ever been assigned . the negative audiofile magazine review of the recording ( quoted here on amazon ) is completely fair . reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it , i found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written , and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating . when it came time to say it all aloud , for the first time ever ( and i 've narrated upwards of <NUM> audiobooks ) i found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever . as declining the job was no longer an option , i merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as i could , but i was unable to compensate for the god awful writing , and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise . it remains the worst recording i have ever done , and i was , for a time , quite ashamed of it . now that i discover more about its hate mongering author , i 'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks . i now believe i gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved . ( i must add that i learned a valuable lesson : never record a book you loathe . i was subsequently offered the execrable `` left behind - the kids '' series for young adults , but having suffered through `` little tree , '' knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of `` christian '' hate .
too boring to ever really loathe , mclachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years , but the compendium is always the same - dull songs , listless vocals , uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement . nothing here as breathtaking as ` ben 's song ' or ` possession ' or ` do what you have to do ' , but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded ` angel ' and ` into the fire ' and ` solace ' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon . she might or might not be a hack , but if she is , she 's a fancy hack . my grade : c
after the success of kamikaze , many diehard twista fans accused him of having sold out , because it was n't until he hit the mainstream that he started seeing platinum sales . love it or hate it , twista tried to continue that essence with his follow-up , the day after . unfortunately , it just does n't work as well . most of the other two-star reviews are pretty accurate ( especially constant and norris ' respective reviews ) . i think it can be assumed that the day after is women 's day because twista is spending most of the album rapping to the ladies ( ll cool j , anyone ? ) . not only that , but in some places it 's a little too obvious that he 's trying to recapture the magic of `` slow jamz '' . the lead single `` girl tonite '' is the most obvious example of this , especially since twist is once again naming balladeers and their respective songs . also , am i the only one to find it a little odd that twista says `` when i touch her , she like '' and then trey says `` oh '' ? ( think about it a minute . ) another example is an obligatory neptunes track called `` lavish '' , where twista proves that he ca n't always rap over a slow beat . yet another song for the ladies that fails is `` so lonely '' featuring mariah carey . i do n't know what 's up with mimi 's voice on the song , but she kind of sounds like a wannabe version of herself . speaking of weird hooks , `` had to call '' features a chorus sung by somebody named sleepy eyed jones , and he sounds like , well , it 's kind of like the equivalent to how dj premier would sound if he tried to sing . there are also some songs that badly use samples , especially the aptly titled `` do wrong '' ( with lil ' kim ) , which borrows a sample from al green 's `` love & happiness '' . and `` i 'm a winner '' terribly samples r. kelly 's `` one me '' , and if that 's not bad enough , twista is even repeating some of the lines he used in `` girl tonite '' . but things are n't much better when he 's not kickin ' it to the females : the title track does n't go anywhere , and syleena johnson 's hook adds nothing to the song . `` heartbeat '' is a little too violent ( especially because the song opens with a long round of shots ) , and `` check that h * '' has a wack chorus . and `` holding down the game '' is a bling-blingin ' song that is unnecessarily screwed and chopped in the middle of it -- and anyway , if you wanted to hear someone rapping slowly , you would n't pick up a twista album , would you ? the only song really worth hearing on the whole album is `` get it how you live '' . it 's nice that twista is still trying to do his thing , but i heard this album one day last week and then i had no desire to listen to it again the day after . anthony ruper
this is not him 's best album . it does live up to it 's name because is more metal-y , but the guitars are louder , and the tunes just are n't as catchy . i would recomend `` dark light '' much more
love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch . the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up . if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i hate the beatles . they are amongst my music guide top <NUM> worst bands ever . they only made a few decent songs in hey jude , let it be , and ballad of john and yoko . rest of their songs just stink ! even a mark knopfler cd without dire straits is better than this ! like i said , anyone who listens to the beatles or zeppelin do n't know what good music is about , huh ! ! ! good music is required dire straits , green day , foreigner , gnr , metallica , and nirvana . get any album from those bands insted . the beatles suck ! ! ! !
i 've read all of iris johansen 's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them -- this , however was not one of them . i found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book . what mysterious event happened to jock and royd ? who is macduff -- well if you have n't read the previous novel , you 'll never know
i am married to a marine officer who is currently deployed to iraq for the second time . as you can imagine , most of our friends are also marine families . additionally , my mother-in-law was a marine wife for <NUM> years . this book is not representative of myself , my mother-in-law , or of any military spouse either of us know . do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life . i do n't want to slam ms smiley . she is entitled to her own life experiences . however , they are not typical `` military spouse '' experiences ( far from it ) so i am writing this review to make sure potential readers are n't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life . it does n't , and it wo n't . the spouses i know are the anti-smiley . the spouses i know are educated , capable , strong , witty , caring , giving , women . the spouses i know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages . i shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me , or any other spouse i know . do not buy this book if you want to learn real , interesting things about the military . read `` making the corps '' instead . do not read this book if you like inspired , compelling story-lines . regardless of the military angle , the story is weak and the writing is bad . am i qualified to judge a good book ? maybe . i read about <NUM> books a year and i am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists . in the end , though , it 's all about your personal taste . read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit
it seems like the actors did n't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts ! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot ... overly timid and shy ... captain wentworth is n't at all handsome or dashing ... and when they finally get together at the end , it 's so awkward , bland , and unclimactic you wished you 'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book ... some people might have liked it , but i definitely did n't . to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like , i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice . this movie could have been bette
this album really sucks . the only good song on it is the last song on the tape
i 've heard al lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible . however , although i basically agree with his approach , i just can not recommend his book . i found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler . there are many much better real estate investment books out there . some specific complaints : * the margins are ridiculously wide ; this book is much smaller than it seems . * some of the appendixes ( especially appendix a ) contained too much filler . * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet . this sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet ( where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet , etc ... rather than in a book . ) * when i heard al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed ( eg , owning property in dallas even if one does not live there ) . the book did not really touch on either of these topics . that said , i did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting . these are : * the chapter on financial statements was useful ; in particular the ways that items for a rental property ( like rents due , funds in lender held escrow accounts , property taxes due , etc ... ) show up on the statements was interesting . * the tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it . * the tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to be during times when school is out . * the recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase
interesting movie , little short on the story line , some of the actors were not as believable as they could have been ( the native americans ) , the romantic scenes were over emphasized , ... i love the period in history , is the only reason i remotely like the movie
i bought this cd after hearing tony on one of the am morning shows , and really likings some of his past offerings , but i have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money . i was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money 's worth . tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years , and i expected a more mature offering from him than this latest . there is a great lack of maturity on this cd , and it 's an overall disappointment . unfortunately , i have to say here that toney is not alone . what on earth possessed veteran soul singers the o'jays to sing a song like let 's ride ? who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages ? hoochie mommas ? what ? babyface ? even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd ! and what 's up with the explicit lyrics ? we all know you can curse like sailors , but why is this language necessary in music ? and i know that artist have always performed their music , but will someone tell me why it 's necessary to perform with so few clothes on ? i would rather hear your music , not see your booty ! sorry , but a review i just read triggered me , and i 'd been thinking about the tony terry cd for a while . hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time . meanwhile i think you 're safe in skipping this particular cd
what 's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior ? this cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations . the author needs to straighten out this feline
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-do n't pick up this edition . it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than <NUM> years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder . its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher , and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning . if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel , pick up the elegant naval institute press edition , in a modern , complete , updated translation , with commentary by the leading american verne expert today , walter james miller . that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition ( no illustrations are to be found in the b & n mercier reprint ) . less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues . this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by jean-michel margot , president najvs
with paul out of the picture , the unseen are definitly not the same band at all . it just seems all the passion has been drained . this album has ok songs , but nothing special . stick to the first two albums , which were some of the best street punk records of their time
i loved this band . whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy <NUM> songs ? are you serious . i would never buy this .
the idea was to have the essentials of ac/dc circuit analysis , linear circuits , electronic circuits , digital logic circuit design , electromechanical machines , and control theory in one handy outline . the problem is , any one of these subjects is way too complex and deep as it is presented in most universities for the book to be helpful for undergraduate electrical engineering students . also , on the whole , this material is far from basic . the material on electromechanical machines and control theory is usually taught in junior or senior undergraduate courses.thus , this book would be most helpful to a professional or someone returning to graduate school for a master 's degree in electrical engineering who needs some review on material that they have previously mastered but possibly forgotten . unfortunately , as the other reviewer pointed out , this book is chock full of errors , thus rendering the book pretty much useless in the problem solving department . if a revised second edition of this book ever comes out with corrections to all of the current errors , i would recommend it to the target audience i have already mentioned , but definitely not to undergraduate engineers who are seeing this material for the first time
i sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years , and i want my week back . it only took that long because i had to push myself to finish it . spoilers ahead : meggie and father ralph ( who everyone always seems to refer to as ralph de bricassart , even when they 're talking to him ) meet when he is twenty-six and meggie is ... ten . she speaks , acts and thinks like a 5-year-old , though . as the years go by , father ralph de bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little meggie , and she develops a girlish crush on him . as meggie is also `` developing a very feminine figure , '' ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be . they discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand `` do n't love me , my darling , for i love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be '' conversations throughout the book . finally , after years of smothering their passion , they do it . in a really very boring scene that 's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions . and would n't ya know it , she gets pregnant . ralph de bricassart realizes ( again ) that their love can never be , and leaves . meggie has his baby , and capers about gleefully that she 's `` stolen '' something back from god . but would n't ya know it , the kid ( who 's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy i 've ever encountered in literature ) decides to be a priest . so she sends him to father ralph de bricassart for training , who -- get this -- is so totally brain dead that it never once occurs to him that this might be his child ! ! ! ! ! ! ! apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood ; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from meggie , when even the other priests figure it out . the big secret finally does come out ( again in a very brief , anticlimactic scene ) toward the end , but by then we 're too busy skimming to really care . all this leaves out a great many things -- including immortal dialogue that makes meggie sound perpetually ten years old ( `` i 'll tell you something else about your roses , ralph de bricassart -- they 've got nasty , hooky thorns ! `` ) , endless , heavyhanded symbolism ( ashes of roses , thorn birds ... we get it ! we get it ! ) , some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for <NUM> % of the book , and one of the most unintentionally hilarious `` tragic '' scenes i 've ever read ( death by pig ) . yet the ralph-and-meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on . and we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together . i was expecting other subplots and development of other characters , and this never really happened . many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing : meggie 's cruel judgment of her daughter justine as a `` monster '' and a `` b * tch , '' for example , seemed to have no basis . the last third or so involves meggie making peace with her mother and daughter , and it just does n't matter . the quick `` the end '' wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if i 'd still cared by that point . even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless , and thoroughly unlikable . scarlett o'hara was selfish , but she was fun ; these people are selfish and boring . sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash .
by setting her story in manhattan , among the literary elite , claire messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of tom wolfe 's `` bonfire of the vanities , '' which described upper-class life in manhattan among the wall street elite , so exquisitely that character descriptions from his <NUM> book ( `` master of the universe '' and `` social skeleton '' ) became part of our vocabulary . claire messud is no tom wolfe . `` the emperor 's children '' describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of `` the emperor , '' a famous writer . unlike `` bonfire of the vanities , '' this book has no compelling narrative - the `` voice '' shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want , who they need and who they love or hate and why . trust me , you wo n't care . meanwhile , the `` emperor '' lopes along as a literary lion past his prime . the characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals ( the `` emperor '' betrays his wife with his daughter 's best friend , the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the `` emperor '' etc . etc . ) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on september <NUM> , <NUM> . but we never learn how september <NUM> affected messud 's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere .

the book contains the complete works of arthur rimbaud in chronological order , in both english and french . there is an excellent short introduction to rimbaud , along with a very nice explanation of the translation process , and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry . sadly , the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to rimbaud . in his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation , mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems . even though my french is inadequate to enjoy rimbaud in his original language , i found myself turning frequently to the french versions of the poems , as i tried to understand how a poet of rimbaud 's reputation could possibly write so poorly . in poem after poem , the french version was more readable than mason 's translation even though i could only understand about a third of what i read . i ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by paul schmidt , which was much more readable . ironically , mason offers criticism of schmidt 's translation in his book . while this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with rimbaud , i would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation
this video/dvd lacks the content it claims it has . it only covers <NUM> or so letters , and does not focus on the sounds . it is pain-stakingly boring , lacks excitement and did not keep my <NUM> month old daughter 's attention . even the bonus section that is supposed to teach the letters on the dvd version did not appeal to her . needless to say , we returned this one to the store . i recommend leapster 's letter factory which has taught my daughter the sounds of the letters within <NUM> weeks and has a bonus interactive letter game
this book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout . his theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died . he was as wrong about history as he was about theology . it has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author 's earlier publication . this man has been discredited as a theologian long ago
with songs like `` i 'd rather ride around with you '' we know we 're in for a nice beach ride ! ! this is an inconsequential offering from reba . just more `` fluff '' aimed at the teenage beach crowd . nothing to stand out here at all
this is the discovery institute 's imitation of emes `` powers of ten '' and `` cosmic voyage , '' in another attempt to establish intelligent design as science . the discovery institute 's key witnesses lied in the recent kitzmiller case and even went so far as to include astrology as `` science . '' the discovery institute has been thoroughly discredited and its products should be avoided . get the genuine dvds , avoid this dvd
although i agree with other reviewers who comment that the connection between this book and the smiths ' album is as thin as smoke , i was prepared to enjoy a well-written story just the same . unfortunately , i finished this wisp of a memoir wishing i had purchased the thirty-three and a third title about love 's `` forever changes '' instead . although i appreciated joe pernice 's occasionally clever metaphors , these were too few and far between , leaving us instead with the musings of the book 's exasperated protagonist , a teenage male infatuated with girls , alcohol , and new wave music . of course , even as ordinary a topic as that can inspire brilliant and funny writing . but it did n't here . at least not for me , as i found pernice 's protagonist niether interesting nor sympathetic . worse , the book 's exaggeration-as-a-primary-comedy-device ( however accurate to the speech patterns of perhaps many , many average seventeen year-olds ) is as unfunny as that dave barry essay . ( you know , the one he 's recycled for the past decade and a half about how computers are complex and children are expensive and men like watching sports and drinking beer ? ) the world is already full of crashing bores as it is . so why not save your time and money and listen to the smiths ' `` meat is murder '' while reading john kennedy toole 's deliciously dark `` a confederacy of dunces '' instead
i genuinely wanted to like this book . however , the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by goldhagen 's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the holocaust . it does n't read like a history book and i was n't surprised to learn ( afterword ) that the author is not a historian . that said , there is value in reading it . the book is rich in facts and detail , the result of some indepth research . however , the way the author uses ( and abuses ) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration . the book is filled with 'post hoc ergo propter hoc ' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove goldhagen 's hypothesis . millions of non-jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work , but it still can be worth a read . but , only if you are not put off by reptitive , awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author 's emotionally driven interpretations
you 'd have to go a long way to find a group of people as unpleasant as those depicted in christophe honore 's film `` ma mere . '' when the film begins , pierre ( louis garrel ) arrives from boarding school in france to spend the summer with his wealthy parents in gran canaria . his father ( philippe duclos ) rattles off some sort of heart-to-heart talk with his son about not really being the sort of person he 's become , but pierre is clearly bored and spoilt , and asks , `` can i go now ? '' pierre 's father returns to france and is abruptly killed in an accident . this leaves pierre alone with his mother , helene ( isabelle huppert ) and their two long-suffering servants . there 's no period of mourning -- although pierre does discover -- and foul -- his dad 's secret stash of naughty magazines , but then the film settles in to its main theme -- the tortured oedipal relationship that exists between pierre and helene . with pierre 's father gone , helene is clearly unleashed , and together with pierre , this mother-and-son team begins the odyssey of pierre 's total and complete debauchment . apparently this is n't difficult to achieve in a city full of holidaymakers and swingers who bravely sport outfits consisting of jockstraps and sequins . plus helene spares no time in introducing her son to her friend , rea ( joana preiss ) -- who is , apparently , `` the wildest woman '' in helene 's wild acquaintance . helene acts sometimes as a voyeur to her son 's debasement , and sometimes as a participant . and it 's all rather no-holds barred , revolting stuff . isabelle huppert is known for accepting risky roles -- consider `` the piano teacher '' for example -- a marvelous film that stretched boundaries . `` ma mere '' does more than stretch boundaries -- it 's an over-the-top kinkfest that sinks rapidly into scene after scene of revolting , purposeless and demeaning encounters . the only joy to be had here is the silly self-righteousness one occasionally indulges in from watching the antics of the filthy rich who have nothing to do all day but engage in depraved activities . huppert , as always , acts her heart out , but after a while , the film just becomes an exercise in how much the viewer will tolerate . in french with english subtitles -- displacedhuma
if julia glass had not set the bar so high with three junes , i would have given the book <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> . there are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the national book award gave ms. glass unconditional confidence in her writing , and character development in particular . she seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around . as another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed transparant . reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what ms. glass ( a privileged white woman of a certain age ) imagines teenagers , or new mexicans , or black chauffeurs , or hispanic nannies , or even gay people to be like . she is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them . the teenagers and the santa fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures . greenie might be the most believable , and although i understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy alan , i was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with `` the other charlie '' . he was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth ( even temporarily ) losing your child over . with saga , she manages to develop her most sympathetic character , but saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end . even the brief appearance of fenno , who i loved in three junes , lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky . all and all , a very disappointing second novel . you have to wonder , since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character , what good is her editor ?
i went to see mato 's reinvented indigenous <NUM> nights ago with high expectations . i have been a fan and seen him many times with the family members that he has since dumped because someone got him to believe they were n't good enough . the sound mix was so bad it was painful to my ears , it physically hurt . mato came off so look-at-me egotistical it would have been laughable if it was n't so offensive . new band members - nothing special , certainly no great improvement from his family which he obviously does not understand was a portion of his band 's original appeal . i walked out on a <NUM> dollar ticket to save my ears . in the past couple days i have visited with a few people and they all said the same word `` disappointing '' . in summation - i highly recommend the early indigenous recordings . i strongly advise you to avoid the new and supposedly improved `` mato '' and any new recordings . hopefully he will come back down to earth and rediscover his roots but i doubt it . i gave <NUM> star only because the review format forced me to
this movie is absolutley horrible . i heard it was an underground funny movie and was told it 's a must watch . i think the only reason i made it through the whole thing was i kept waiting for the funny parts , next thing i know , the credits were rolling . bleach ! amazingly awful
this really is a good film ... so why in the world did they lop off the sides of it ? it is time for a w i d e s c r e e n version of this film ! in widescreen , my star rating for this film is <NUM> .
i would have ordered this soundtrack except i actually took the time to check out the list of `` songs '' that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews . sure enough , it was exactly as i thought myself .... there was only one song that i actually recognized from the movie itself , gloria gaynor 's `` i will survive '' , which is a good song , but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself , but not in the actual `` soundtrack '' ! what 's up with that ? ? ? great movie , great songs , should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans , but it does not . too bad . i understand that the person who wrote the actual `` musical score '' for the movie wants his due , but the fans want `` their '' music , too . do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie ?
i am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out . unfortunately , i was horribly disappointed . the acting was terrible , elements of the story were changed ( i know , it ca n't be <NUM> % true to the book , but this was a massacre ) , and the characters were ruined ( c'mon , they made the movie version mr. tumnus seem just a tad bit ... um ... creepy ) . they turned aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion . seriously , go read the books and do n't waste your time on this film .
i get the story line but <NUM> grown women need to suicide ! ? the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night . why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! ? ! ? it is not matching the character
the good first . there is a lot of good . i enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal . my husband and i have a great marriage . he knows i have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me . he is certainly not ever wanting more sex , just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes . ( in jest i 'm sure . ) i say that to show , that not coming from a prude , the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it 's normal . i am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice . it was dealt with like , it 's a fact so get used to it . your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look , or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night . the men give accounts of this , like , oh well , does n't mean i do n't love my wife . in my opinion , just b/c they are n't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts , does n't mean it 's ok . i found the book to be very very discouraging . that a bunch of married christian men would unapologetically ( key word here ) see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less ( we 're not talking lingerie here ) and think about what she 's like in bed or what her nipples look like . there 's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart . or maybe they should not do this . it really threw me for a loop ! i guess i did n't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are . not that i think they do n't want a lot of it . but i found it discouraging for christian wives to think that their husbands ca n't go to work without picturing everyone naked . i found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it 's `` normal '' and women just need to get used to the idea
i read recently that sheryl crow 's song `` good is good '' a song from her new album , was nominated for a grammy award . seriously , how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that . tnmc , also won a grammy when it was released . i still can not understand why , but i do have a theory . simply put , the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity . while only a mediocre talent at best , sheryl crow is deified . i realize that this is only my opinion ( and i have a right to state it ) this type of music nauseates me . there is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated . do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek . i do have a solution : all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned `` crimes '' should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some `` soul . '' peace
this show joins the long list of comic cartoon abominations . and it 's done in anime . maybe someday they 'll do a teen titans : the animated series .
this movie absolutely sucks , it has nothing to do with halloween or halloween ii . they wasted their time on this one . what the hell are they thinking not involving michael meyers or at least his mask . duh !
the film why we fight , i believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize america . i felt that the movie , only told one side of the argument , and that side was clearly not pro-america . the film portrays the united states as a power hungry nation , which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world . the film constantly criticizes the decisions of america leaders to engage into foreign combat . the film however , does not present an alternative solution . it fails to take into consideration that america may be acting out of self defense . the film constantly criticizes america for engaging in combat throughout the world . what i have to say to the director of this film is : is it not alright to defend your nation , after terrorist drive planes into two buildings , killing 3,000 people ? is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots , who are looking to destroy your way of life ? is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the middle east , by toppling a murderous dictator ? when i see these questions , i have to answer no to all of them . i feel that if america feels threatened , it should not have to seek permission to defend itself . president bush put it properly i feel when he stated `` after the chaos and carnage of september 11th , it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers , '' and `` america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people . '' this film can criticize america and label it as a bully nation , but these terrorist must be brought to justice . president eisenhower once said , `` peace and justice are two sides of the same coin . '' as the most powerful nation in the world , it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world . it is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as americans , sometimes take for granted . since when , has it become wrong to defend your nation . why must america be criticized for engaging in conflict , when it feels threatened ? is it not the job of the president of the united states to defend the <NUM> million people he was elected to represent ? does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack america again , if they are given the chance ? we can never let our guard down . freedom does not come free . on september <NUM> , <NUM> we saw firsthand how evil , those who want to destroy us can be . you can not negotiate with these types of people . the only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force . on the morning of the september <NUM> , <NUM> attacks , president bush stated that `` freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward , and freedom will be defended . '' indeed freedom was and is being defended , and i see nothing wrong with that . words are not enough to protect our nation . president theodore roosevelt said , `` great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind , but great actions speak to all mankind , '' and our great action , will be to defend this great nation . in the words of president hoover , `` freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity , '' and it is america 's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom . remember : `` words without actions are the assassins of idealism . '' herbert hoove
it seems that people either love it or hate it and i belong to the latter category . how did this become a classic ? ? ? having forced myself to read to the end i 'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage
yo , do n't take this the wrong way because i 'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan . but this album is terrible . its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old biggie verses and whipping up new beats . biggie certainly did n't leave very much unreleased material unlike tupac then again i suppose he was n't expecting he was going to die . but they still should n't do s * * * like this . if you want to support biggie 's legacy this year which is n't a bad idea , pick up one of the classics - ready <NUM> die or life after death .
toward the end of this novel , the lead character , reichs ' usual heroine tempe brennan , remarks on the `` remarkable coincidence '' of one of the plot points . by this point in the book , this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it 's got some spittle on its chin . this book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed , it would fall into <NUM> or <NUM> different books with little or nothing to do with one another . reichs is not a bad writer , and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background , is passably adept at character , plot and scene setting . she knows how to build suspense and intrigue , and never lets the technicalities of her lead character 's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work , undermine the story . this book centres on brennan 's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders . there are lots of interesting points about how cults work , ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action . and , of course , several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones , collecting maggots and bugs , and examining various grim bits of the human body . what undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different , unrelated stories ; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one , that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity . the jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun 's bones , and the mysteries therewith . in fact , this is just story number <NUM> , which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate , main storyline . it is not obvious , even in terms of the world of death du jour , why reichs needed all this intermingling . it feels like she started writing a travel journal , then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call , then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot . in this context , each individual story feels derivative , and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick . a well-written and , at times , interesting book , which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous
ballroom and latin dance has come a long way . even though many of the dancers on the dvd are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit , this is not a great showcase . this is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today , but not the kind of video you will watch over and over . the only truly spectacular dancing is that of marcus and karen hilton ( standard only ) . they were then , and are now quite amazing . for those of us in canada , alain doucet and anik jolicouer are on this tape , briefly , in the standard final
everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it 's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx , his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx 's than pac 's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop . it 's like jah is d 's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer
-everyone expressing a erudite opinion about clausewitz or `` on war '' has completely missed the point here . -the question is not whether clausewitz or `` on war '' is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs . that is a moot piont to the nth degree . -the real question is - why would you pay $ 595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $ 30.oo ? ! ? ! ? ! ? -that is the only question regarding this particular version of `` on war '' . -its the economics , stupid !
ok this is another one of anna 's pointless films . it sucked . i think instead of renting this video send your $ <NUM> to anna so she can pay for some acting classes

there are two stellar tracks on this : & quot ; mccarran airport , '' sounding like a lost jimmy webb classic , and the wistfully gorgeous & quot ; spring time. & quot ; a quick look at the credits show they 're the only two from the pen of brother bruce . as for the rest -- think kenny g meets h/d/h . sadly , that stands for hallmark/doggerel/hallmark . and that 's too bad , as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money . if there 's to be a follow-up , give bruce free reign
a question for anyone who has this dvd pack . i am after a movie my friends and i watched years ago . it was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home . a killer is running lose as we hear on the news , playing on the car radio . the petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting . he tries to get her out of the car but she wont . he attacks the car trying to get her out . what she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her ... this short movie was on with <NUM> other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game . we would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it . we are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon . thank you . aussie girls
i found this book to be offensively un-american . the characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts . the best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises . i think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters .
as wretched as these two are , it 's worth owning miri just to witness a <NUM> year-old michael j.pollard passing as a <NUM> year-old and hearing shatner emote `` no blah-blah-blah !
judging by the clips offered from amazon , this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material , but i was dissapointed after the first spin , and i have n't put it back in since . it 's not bad stuff , just that the jams are lacking in creativity , and the true funk feel is missing . try greyboy allstars ( who are the best live ) , or try the next level in jambads : phish
i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie . this movie is contrived . the character that reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie . personally , i do n't find his behavior to be romantic . he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him . this is not romantic to most women nowadays . he is not suave in the role he is playing . it seems like a cheesy <NUM> 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it
simply put , this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself . it 's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical , drunken uncle . `` blah blah blah ... and then i saved the world and looked good doing it .... blah blah blah ... are n't i great ? ! ? !
i find it hard to believe that the same band who put out the heavy metal classic `` burn my eyes '' and the strong follow-up `` the more things change '' , would suddenly sink into the nu-metal trash . to be honest , most nu-metal that i actually like , i would n't buy a cd from ( the nu-metal cds i do have are from my nu-metal phase ) . the awesome riffs , the cool solos , the sweet drumming , and a band who had a message about society have been pushed aside here for power chords , rapping , and self loathing lyrics . i gave this <NUM> stars because i like <NUM> or <NUM> songs on here , but one of those <NUM> songs is a cover . when i saw the music video for `` from this day '' , it almost made me want to slap rob in the face . he went from a tall , powerful metalhead to a stupid , trendy , spiky-haired w igger . they would get worse on `` supercharger '' , but thank god that machine head recovered on `` through the ashes of the empires '' . this is not a good place to start for machine head at all . get their first <NUM> albums and their new one to hear rob and the gang as a post thrash/groove metal powerhouse , not a nu-metal slump
i think someone forgot to tell molotov that rap-metal/rock-rap was dead . had potential , but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me
i was not pleased with the quality of this recording . the mcgarrigles are just wonderful , but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster . the first and last cuts seem ok , but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy ! the piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible . i also did n't appreciate the sisters ' reworking of several songs i already love from `` the bells of dublin '' ( some of the best christmas music ever recorded ) . the sparkle i longed for just is n't there in this one
rappers like this piece of s * * * , him and nelly , all that southern bull is the reason rap is flockin , one of theese days <NUM> and ja are gon na end up like big n pac.what i do is , i be honest is i listen to rap and rock , also thats played out if you want to wath thoose new bands and there videos watch fuse , but anyway i may be laughed at n s * * * but i listen to rap from the <NUM> 's and the early <NUM> 's cause there aint jack s * * * out there but bubble gum m.c. , s.anyway lets get back to chingy , the only good major release he has is that jackpot bulls * * * .plus his f * * * * * style is annoying he sounds like a chipmunk on helium . anyway if you like underground rap go cop some music from aesop rock , murs , wordsworth , mf doom , but please avoid this s * * * at any cause . p.s . happy new year <NUM> ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
immortel ( ad vitam ) ( enki bilal , <NUM> ) while i was not overly impressed with bilal 's nikopol trilogy on the page , i figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride , and with bilal himself at the helm , i had high hopes for it . most of them , unfortunately , were dashed in the first few minutes . the one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice . and it does -- some of the cgi faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the final fantasy film . and the integration of actual actors and cgi characters is often seamless . the `` sets , '' though , are second-rate bladerunner wannabes . there was a lot of potential in them , and most of it was wasted . the acting , even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent ( charlotte rampling , for example ) , is atrocious . the two main actors , linda hardy ( who , aside from this , has yet to land a major role ) and thomas kretschmann ( soon to be seen in the film adaptation of the celestine prophecy ) are both wooden . rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then , but it 's not nearly enough . the plot is ... well , i can definitively say there is a plot . and that it is , in fact , connected to the nikopol trilogy in some way . but when you do n't meet the character of nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film , that should tip you off that things are n't staying completely faithful to the book . there are scenes you 'll recognize , if you 've read the nikopol trilogy , but i can tell you from experience : having read it does not make this movie any more lucid . in fact , it may add to the confusion . in short , aside from the visually appealing aspect , i ca n't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to , well , anyone .
if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book , stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive
this joker called blink-182 punk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! give me a break , this is emo , and not punk . there are a few bands on here i like . but the rest is crap
getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth ... and they were all for buying it
i had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the infantastic dvds from amazon . i waited over two months , kept getting reassured that they were still coming , and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know . not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme , but amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days , which is at best a misrepresentation , and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they ca n't provide the product at all at this point . i do n't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted .
this book was not at all what i expected . i have no desire to use burlap as a window treatment . in additon , the photography is very poor . the colors are washed out and the windows are just bright white . i would not have bought this book if i could have seen it before hand . i do not recommend this book
oh yay ; more on germany compiled from the german hater . much to like here if you hate germans . as objective as anything from moscow in the <NUM> 's
the amazon description says vol . 1-3 , boxed set , hardcover . that is all true . what they do n't tell you is that there are actually six volumes . the box in which it comes is clearly marked , `` volumes 1-3 ( of six ) . '' that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used . if you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set , this book is for you . if you are looking for the complete set , look elsewhere
i enjoyed this film , but it has nude childern and i did not think it was needed in the story
as a contemporary of joan baez ( age-wise ) , i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice . i even empathize with much of her politics , but unfortunately it 's time she rested on her laurels . her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of , and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs , and her earlier quality . like some professional athletes , she seems to not know when to quit ...
here in brazil , about ten years ago , i tried to read this bad book , but i never finished it.i tried to read , one book printed in argentina , wrote in spanish.this book is bad about even guerrilla warfare . in fact , never any of the tatics describe in this book gave victory to any army or revolution.the sucess in cuba , came not from victory in battle.in fact , never happened a single battle in cuban revolution.it came from the cowardy of batista and his mafia 's government . ever when an army or even mercenaries tried to defeat che guevara , they got it , very fast and whith no dificulties.this happened in congo , to exemple.finally , in bolivia , who was n't and never was a military power , che was ridiculous at guerrilla.even so , che guevara was easily defeated in bolivia , and murdered soon after surrendered in <NUM> . in fact , any guerrilla in this world got any military victory , using guevara 's tatics and theories . many parts of latin america had communists taking power , but in any of then using guerrilla warfare . the ever used gramsci 's theories and books to take the power . brazil is an exemple.our communists tried some guerrillas , using cuba 's money and support between <NUM> and 1974.all of then were easily and fast defeated . after all , our left has total control of this coutry , but from press , scools , tvs , etc . control . as antonio gramsci wrote in <NUM> 's italy , when the left controls the intelectuals , the media , the school sistem , all society is put under left 's control without a single shot . this happened in brazil , argentina , bolivia , venezuela , etc
... i 'm a huge john wayne fan , but this movie has some serious shortcomings , including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that , while acceptable at the time , are not so well received today . i wo n't knock john wayne 's acting , however , because he performed it as only john wayne could . but some of the other acting was downright daffy , like when the singing eddie powers ( william frawley ) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine . ... the fighting seabees was n't a totally bad movie , and i thought the formation of the seabees ( if this movie is accurate ) was very interesting . but some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better
i love eddie murphy , and i loved dr. doolittle ! the previews of dr. d ii looked so funny , i could n't wait to see it . well , i just saw it , and my mind has still not recovered . dr. doolittle <NUM> is one of the worst films i have ever seen . the story and dialouge are so mind-numbing , even the animated murphy and raven symone , who plays his teenage daughter , could n't salvage it . the story revolves around dr. doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer . to do this , doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild , because this bear is an endangered species , and if he lives in the forest , the developer ca n't touch it . sounds kind of cute . . . it 's not . the bear acts and sounds like a washed up vegas lounge singer . his whiny voice ( steve zahn ) is so annoying that even i , a passionate animal lover , could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear . and talk about long . this whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until i writhed in pain . and the other animals ! a sad , alcoholic french monkey , a chamelon with a horrible mexican accent , and an abusive bear and his passive female bear . when the bear is not whining , a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal , bland voice with horrible dialouge . a subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot , is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights . murphy actually acquieses . what an intelligent , lovely girl like raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable . it is hard to believe people ( and animals ) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film . it seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge , and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and i do n't blame them

kroeger 's selection of david matthews as a supposed `` passer '' is racist . matthews , unlike the other subjects of this book , was truly `` passing '' for what he really was . he was born of a jewish mother and has predominately white ancestry . that qualifies him to call himself both a `` jew '' and a `` white . '' kroeger implies that he is n't good enough to be either . for the other side of this `` passing '' issue , read : `` passing '' for who you really are : twelve essays in support of multiracial whiteness http : //www.backintyme.com/ad222.htm http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0939479222/backintyme-20/103-3968075-455503
this is one of my favorite authors . i could hardly wait to open burning bright and get lost in london of the <NUM> 's . well , lost i got ! each page was more and more boring . i read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library . after reading the other reviews i am glad i didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending .
i think i 've seen almost everything bob 's been involved with and this just did n't do it for me . if you have friends and they are n't complete dullards , you 've probably had most of the conversations you 'll see in this movie
bought this dvd for only <NUM> dollars at a not-so-local shopping centre , only because they did n't have this movie to rent at the video shop . after so much publicity , trailers , ads on busses , you 'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around . however . i nearly fell asleep in it . had to turn away more than a few times in boredom . and cliched to infinity , just watch the ending . pathetic and predictable . if you like predictable movies ? this dvd will be your new best friend . if not ? try something with a bit more imagination
i love morton feldman . i have a lot of his music , and i especially like the second string quartet . triadic memories leaves me indifferent . it may be the performance , i do n't know . but the music is boring . and repeat listenings only confirm my experience
nothing hear , just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man . whoa , if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions , i would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene .
<NUM> years ago i was so stoked that clapton was finally coming out with a new album , i walked five miles to deorsey 's records in lewiston , maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record . the still near virgin vinyl remains in my lp collection and has only been played once . once was enough . heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness , inspiration and technical ability . sad .
competed so much with the spoken word . i would n't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen so hard to hear the words that it becomes very & quot ; unrelaxing & quot ; . however if you chose to listen to this during the day this would probably work for you
this brainless , low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of john carpenter 's vampires was so foul and lame that the studios could n't even bribe one of their lap-dog `` reviewers '' to crank out a glowing review for the dvd cover . or maybe they could n't afford the kickback -- who knows ? in any case , the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that i used the dvd later to drain my spaghetti . `` john carpenter presents '' -- a piece of incredible crap ! ! its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile
o.k . when i heard that dave was going to remaster/re-release the megadeth back catalog i got real excited . i still believe that this album is a true masterpiece , but when i bought the <NUM> remaster/remixed version i was mortified ! ! ! ! what was dave thinking when he decided to remix it . all it needed was to be beefed up just a little , but he went to great extremes to ruin it . i know megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this , but the one thing i did remember is that the first time i heard countdown ... when it was release in <NUM> it gave me chills ........ period ! i have regrets about buying all the remasters at once ....... big mistake ! ! ! so in closing i went back and found the original versions of so far ... so good ... so what ! , rust in peace , and of course countdown to extinction , and yes capitol punishment ... the megadeth years . i 'm glad that i was able to locate them
charles laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised . but it 's lumbering and creaky , with heavy-handed theatrics , typical of the early talky era . i found watching this picture very heavy going
this book should never have been re-released . it is that bad . save your time , money , and vision . none of the characters are believable or likeable . meredith 's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to billings after <NUM> or <NUM> years instead of <NUM> . i have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and <NUM> year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an mba . not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story . cy is totally appalling . why would anyone trust him in business or in bed ? and yet our heroine falls for him over and over again . how stupid . how could he live with his mother for <NUM> some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives ? how could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there ? and what about the mysterious mr. smith ? although called a bodyguard , he acted only as a babysitter . he could have been interesting . was n't he worth a story line ? he did not even rate a first name . unbelievable . this book was too , painfully long with characters i never cared about . it was torture to read . even the sex was bad . for people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex . put this one back in mothballs . and diana , do not be afraid to write about a mature woman . love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over <NUM>
crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life . i feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album , currently out of print , called `` infinity '' that truely ranks with his best . it was rescued from the vaults back in <NUM> by alice coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique coltrane recording of all time . i first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me . there is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life . please note that i accidently gave `` cresent '' a one star rating - i meant to give it five stars .
they cut major scenes out of this film , which makes no sense to me . this movie needs to be released in its original format . they could have took out the pointless special features and used the full movie . it really makes no sense when the movie comes on tv it is the full version -- very sad
i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this albu
i was very disappointed with the latest album from bon jovi , a band that has put out numerous exceptionally high quality albums throughout their career . obviously no one still expects them to put out albums today that set the scene of what is cool music wise , that they did back in the <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's with the classics such as slippery when wet , new jersey and keep the faith . obviously like everyone else from that era they rely on the next generation to tell them what is the latest rage music wise but this album music wise does n't seem to fall into the latest style or ignore the latest trends and maintain their classic sound . the album is like a continuation sound wise of their previous album this left feels right , which was a greatest hits album rerecorded with their classic songs in a way that emphasised their lyrics . that was great for the classics songs hearing them in a new way but this style for a whole album of new songs really does n't do anything for me or anyone else i 've come across . have a nice day is catchy and fast enough to be a great live song and it 'll be around for a while if not forever but i do n't think in five years time any other song from this album , like with other mediocre albums like crush and bounce will be played on the radio or at a bon jovi concert ( and make sure you go to one of these before you or they die as they are the best live band one earth ) . i hope that the guys have a few more good albums left in them but this certainly is not an indication that they do .
it was terrible ! lili played a good part of course . but the rest was just plain stupid
granted , i should have seen this coming , having read louisa may alcott 's predictable preteen novel before buying the film version . i guess i was hoping that the movie would fix up all the flat characterizations and narrow plotlines i had lamented while reading alcott 's early piece . alas , i put too much faith in cinema . the movie did absolutely nothing to improve upon the book . the main female character is far too demure and morally perfect to connect in any real way with her audience ( which actually seems to sell more books than i would think , as per janette oke ) and the female antagonist is villified to the extent that she no longer seems human . the male love-interest is the traditional tall , dark , handsome , and vacuous one who , though faithful to his love , lacks any sort of purpose outside of wooing her . overarching these characterization flaws is a general lack of cinematographic care that relegates this movie to the `` made-for-tv '' genre , which , though not dominated solely by poor films , is not known for its quality . to me , it was much like watching a lifetime movie : predictable , entertaining for lack of an alternative , and not terribly significant . do n't read me incorrectly . this movie is great for anyone who is just plain bored . if you do n't enjoy actually watching the movie , you will probably enjoy laughing incredulously as each character delivers horrible lines . hey , it 's only <NUM> bucks , anyway . why not buy it and see for yourself ? it 's what i did , and just because i was disappointed does n't mean you have to be
this is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about machiavelli 's major works . what i wanted , however , was to understand the context in which machiavelli wrote , and i would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond florence . if you understand references to the founding of rome , to 15th century papal politics , and have a good grounding in livy , this book is for you . if , like me , what you wanted from a introduction to machiavelli was to have someone explain machiavelli 's context and allusions , look elsewhere
i give this book a <NUM> star not because it was n't interesting - it certainly was , but because the ending absolutely floored me ! aghgh * * & & * ( <NUM> # ! ! ! ! ! i never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice ? ? i feel like something is missing . i want to reach into the book and smack alex ! please tell me there is a follow-up book where sam gets what 's coming to him ! ! ! -- oh , and daphne too
this book achieved instant fame when it was published in <NUM> , not only for its scathing criticism of the versailles treaty but also for its personal attacks against leading signatories ( especially clemenceau and wilson ) . for a book focused primarily on economic concerns , the text is surprisingly easy to read . however , the book 's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness . the principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than john maynard keynes , the founder of 20th century style , gov't & debt driven economics . the book is organized into chapters on pre-war europe , allied statesmen , summary of key treaty points , reparations , post-war europe predictions , and keynes ' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement . unfortunately , within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason . ( is this indicative of keynes ' own personal organization and logical thinking ? ) within the book , he makes a very practical ( but politically infeasible ) argument for a non-vindictive treaty . he basically suggests that the allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other allies , and instead they should settle ( though not ideally ) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only german gov't property . ( did the german gov't sponsor keynes ' work in writing this book ? ) keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the german people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise . there is some logic in this point ; however , later on he goes on to state that the us should forgive its $ <NUM> billion debt to its wartime allies ( $ <NUM> billion of which was owed by the uk ) . forgive me if i 'm wrong , but does n't such a move disincent american entreprises from entrepreneurship as well . it 's extremely hypocritical that the allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the us during the war and then once it was over to claim that they could n't pay them . if they did n't want to repay , then they should n't have borrowed the money - period . ( if i borrow money to buy a home , the bank wo n't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether i 'm out of work , injured , or the house burns down . i do n't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment . ) notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic , keynes does produce a reasonable , brief list of treaty rememdies , especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout central and eastern europe . not until the advent of the cold war and the interests of extending american political influence would keynes ' policies largely succeed ( albeit yet again to the detriment of american taxpayers ) . overall , i felt the book was ok . i would only recommend it if you have an interest in reading all of keynes ' work . do n't expect to find any theoretical economic insights in the book , though . based on the high ratings on this page , i think the other reviewers here might have some pro-keynesian bias
and what for ? i 'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first cd ( for example , try the partisan ) . the original recordings were noisy . this remastered version keeps all the noise , but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases . all in all , the selected songs are a good representation of cohen 's musical career
i have been an ardent fan of agatha christie and jane marple for <NUM> years or more but if this had been the first christie movie i had seen it would also have been the last . i had a hard time recognizing any of the story in this movie . in fact i stopped and reread the book to be sure i was not completely off track . this is a perfectly good story ruined by overzealous 'modernization ' and revision . geraldine mckewan certainly makes a poor jane marple but this is the first one i have seen her in so she might grow on you after a while . i liked the way the story developed and the way it was solved but the story line was completely ruined by the movie . i suppose the movie would have been better if i had n't been a jane marple fan but she was completely extraneous to the story in this one and really did n't appear to contribute to the story at all . i was planning to buy both series of these movies but now i will wait for something else
most of the time i love french films . <NUM> blows , breathless , etc . this one caught my eye so i bought it . waste of $ $ . horrible . i never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one . it was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound . i looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep .
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good . however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people . in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine . i sat through this film , against my better judgement . still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend `` a streetcar named desire '' , `` kids '' , `` last exit to brooklyn '' , and `` traffic '' .
this is definately not the linda ronstadt that i have loved listening to for the past <NUM> years ! i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70s . loved her nelson riddle big band stuff , her tucson sessions album with emmylou harris , and just picked up her `` frenesi '' album and love it too . but this ... this is definately not the album to showcase her vocal talents . i could not even finish listening to it . the last cd i will buy without previewing the songs first . skip it .
this cd sucks . i mean bruce springstein is such a has been . dude retire please ! u2 also another has been group . i think someone needs to revamp the grammy nominations and choose some really great music . ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old ! !
yo this album was overrated and for no reason i 'm not gone say that 's it 's plain garbage but if they had a betta team lyrical wise and a better production team then they would be alright . the best tracks on the whole thing is shawnna 's gettin ' some and the track call that 's my s * *
this album was a disappointment . i was looking forward to muddy 's covers of & quot ; caldoinia & quot ; and & quot ; kansas city & quot ; but it wasnt what i thought itd be . dont get me wrong , muddy himself was fine , but he gets overshadowed by the musical collaborators . there is an overuse of harmonica and organ , and the annoying presence of accordian ! accordians and waters do not mix . this over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and folky and not bluesy . if you 're looking for muddy 's later work , try & quot ; blues sky & quot ; , with muddy working with johnny winter and his back to basics production
as others have noted , this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in spanish sung by maria del rey , plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men ( not very good for putting a baby to sleep ) , plus the whole thing repeated in english . in addition , i had been looking for traditional latin american pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary . do n't waste your money ... i 'm planning on giving my copy away if i can figure out someone i know who could actually use it
bad special effects as far as the model work goes . stupid love story that you have to fast forward through . 60s hairdos on what are supposed to be 1940s women . it 's just low budget and lame
i bought this cd online but realized soon afterwards that it was hard to listen to ... but heavenbound was so impressive i can not give it a bad rating . first of all , of course it 's bad ! it was their first cd , it was the late '80s and kevin was not a prominent member . but rewind , give them grace and see how far they 've come , and you 'll appreciate how they started out , however bad it was . however , i see no reason for anyone but a die-hard fan to buy this cd . compared to the other incredible selection of christian music that is out now , it 's a pitiful little dot in the corner . but it signifies the start of successful christian rap/hip hop , so it 's pretty interesting as far as christian music history goes . but like i said , it 's not worth it if you do n't know the group . do n't `` start here '' , and in fact , do n't even really end here . it 's more interesting than `` good '' . overall , it 's not the greatest ... but if you think it 's worth the buy for heavenbound , then do it , because the song is really lyrically great
i 've loved some of shakira 's previous songs , and when i heard `` hips do n't lie '' , and the fabulous `` do n't bother '' ( i love those lyrics ) , i just had to get the album . i put it off for a while , but saw it at a semi-reasonable price , and bought it . my oh my . it is n't good ! ! ! the only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks . i listened it to it twice . normally i can love an album on first listen , very rarely will i get bored of it on a second listen . nope , not with this one . shakira has a lovely voice , but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as `` hips do n't lie '' and `` do n't bother '' . do n't bother buying this album unless you are a true , die hard fan of shakira . do n't waste your money
the numerous vague flow charts , weak graphics , and conflicting statements did little to promote the learning process . cites many dated studies and implies causation with little statistical relevance . similarly , the author 's exam questions led to more frustration as many appear to be developed to trick the reader
this is horrendous movie . i will never claim it as the movie of my generation . it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the `` <NUM> 's '' . the others are : breakdancing , the yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women with manly handshakes , new wave music , and junk movies like this . i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself , and what he can get out of life . he ridicules his friend because he 's sick , and does n't feel like driving ferris around ... especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage , so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for `` it was a good day '' . i do n't care what decade it was , or what was cool back then , or now manipulating your friends is `` not '' i repeat '' not '' cool . i know with john and johnette q . public this is something of a sexual relase . i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie , and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny .
think about the premise , it 's not only creepy , it 's just wrong . the august brothers were sexually abused and victimized as young men and now the only way they can feel complete love from a woman is together . i know , i know it 's total backwoods jerry springer crap ! ! ! i really do n't like books like this . ones that have a racier theme or kink and wrap it up with a bow and call it `` fufilling '' or `` complete love '' . where i come from having a threesome or foursome with your brothers is just disturbed ! ! ! and the women in story just buy into this warped way of thinking . i do n't know about other ladies but if a guy i was dating suggested this ; there would be a me shaped hole in the door , and burnt rubber in the driveway !
i bought this lp when it first came out . i 'd drowned my happy soul in `` out of the cool '' and got lost for months in the moods of `` individualism '' . add to that his `` guitar forms '' lp with kenny burrell and the `` sketches '' album , i was ready for more of the pure evanescence , and not ready for gil evans to do what most self-respecting composers do -- shift gears . no , change cars . in mid-drive . this album was a huge change to me , and i tried to follow him but could n't . kind of like trying to follow stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase . maybe he ( gil evans ) made it , maybe the other reviewers are right , and it 's all great stuff , but it lost me . no magic , no startles , no surprises that i could suck into my soul and thrive on . so , be warned , be cautious . it 's a change , and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career , and if you loved `` individualism '' , you might not make the jump . then again , maybe you will . i just have to go on record to say all this , as one evans fan who is disappointed
cocorosie sucks . they ca n't sing . and they really piss me off using the n word in their jesus loves me song .
this album will only appeal to die hard ub40 fans and not casual fans or fans who loved the old up tempo sound of ub40 on lol <NUM> and <NUM> . this album only has <NUM> up tempo songs that sound like the old ub40 from the early <NUM> 's and early <NUM> 's . download the songs come back darling and mr . fix it , so you can save your money . i love ub40 , but after listening to lol <NUM> and <NUM> i thought lol <NUM> was going to be a classic , but it is not close compared to the previous lol albums and seems like it was just put out to make a quick buck because there was no passion in the music and singing , which made the entire album boring or like reggae elevator music until i heard the two songs i already mentioned and recommend downloading . those two songs saved the album in my opinion , otherwise it would have gotten zero stars .
reads like a law textbook . author often uses three sentences where one would do . much ink is wasted telling the reader `` we wo n't go into that here , but chapter `` x '' deals exclusively with that . '' concepts are understandable for those with an accounting background , but definitely would not recommend to someone without a solid grasp of accounting fundamentals . author should have hired a writer to help him smooth out his writing style . not recommended
zero stars , but that isnt an option ... -so lets say , `` f '' for effort ... let me start by saying i love the horror/gore genre , but junk like this needs to be put to an end ... at some point enough has got to be enough ... this `` movie '' was shot using a canon xl ( at best ) ... apparently film was out of the question ... the acting is miserable , the camera work and lighting was a joke ... and the violence and gore was laughable ... and i dont mean laughable like outrageous ... but laughable because it is that bad ... hack editing ruins every death scene ... the only real gore comes in the form of various characters spitting gallons of blood after altercations ... the highlight of the `` movie '' was a dude putting a melon on this dude head and then shooting a 9mm through it ... as if things couldnt get any worse ... these clowns didnt take the time to sync the dialogue to the lip motions ... avoid this at all costs ... you have been warned ..
i honestly hate kidz bop . i mean , avril lavigne is my favorite singer , and my happy ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by kidz bop . i mean , i sing in the shower better then these kids ! do n't buy it . borrow it from the library if you must .
21/2 scoops out of five . obviously some very talented players here , some moments of complexity here and there , but the material is poopy . for my personal tatse , this would get a big fat lonely star , but it 's not really bad music , i just could not get it . the production is typical of early <NUM> 's , way overdone , shiny , artificial , there 's no proper spacial imagery at all . can you say compression ? yuck . not the greasy , sweaty funk from the <NUM> 's . made me think of being in an ice cream parlor at times . were these tracks leftovers from bad 1989-90 sessions or what
there 's a reason you do n't know much about his earlier career . if you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late <NUM> 's california band , get quicksilver messenger service first album . at least sailor had a minor hit ( living in the usa ) . i would be more lenient if this was the first album . seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks , but he 's got a long way to go . he must have been connected , i would not have let him record another album after the first . but , good thing they did because he was much better in the <NUM> 's .
this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good . i 've read all iles ' complicated yet fasinating novels , most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed . but this <NUM> hours did n't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes ' over <NUM> minutes , i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again . the other books such as the quiet game , sleep no more , blood memory , dead sleep are all great reading experiences , his first and second ones were just too jewish focused . concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles , although after hurricane katrina , the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right , not as good as what iles described in his novels . all said , this time no cigar for you , poncho
is it true that the lead singer for hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated ? his voice sounds so . the way he sings `` lips of an angel '' makes me want to punch him in the face ! i 'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group . i seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before i heard the chorus !
high points and low points often in the same song . overall a pretty forgetable performance . i found jack walrath 's ( trumpet ) performance pretty inspiring , but george adams ( sax ) came off as a way over the top and annoying . i think i 'll go listen to mingus ah um right now to wash the taste out of my mouth
tanya ca n't act her way out of a - well , anything , but she can get out of any clothing whatever , and the gratuitous shots from below as she climbs trees and swings from ropes are great good fare for pubescent teenage boys without much of a social life . fred wass does what he does best , wanders around on cue and collects a paycheck for no obvious reason . any one over the age of eighteen will want to drink a lot of beer while wasting time with this
if you want a good hank <NUM> album , go with lovesick broke & driftin ' . it 's a more impressive and mature work than this one , which seems slapped together and unoriginal . the best songs on risin ' outlaw are the three written by wayne hancock , who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to hank sr . so what you end up with on this disc is hank <NUM> imitating wayne hancock imitating hank williams , sr. and since wayne hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with , and his performances of his own songs are better than hank <NUM> 's , why not just get the original hancock cds ? the cover of `` thunderstorms and neon signs '' on risin ' outlaw seems particularly pointless , as hank <NUM> uses an identical delivery , launching into falsettos at the same time , holding certain notes the same way , etc . i can understand why someone would want to cover it -- it 's a beautiful song -- but at least add * something * of your own to it . to use an art analogy , it 's like hank <NUM> is tracing over a drawing that wayne hancock made , but it is apparent that hank <NUM> is n't as good of an artist . having said this , risin ' outlaw is still better than <NUM> % of the trash played on country radio . but i think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album . still , if you get the chance to see hank <NUM> play live , do n't miss it
you got to be kidding me right ? people actually giving this album <NUM> stars . wow people are so blind it is n't even funny . this is all commercialized garbage . e-40 is all on this `` hyphy '' tip now , lmao how wack is that . hyphy is straight wack , the lyrics have no concept what so ever . all pointless . production , well yea all these commercialized albums got production , like this album . but then again where are the lyrics ? this is one of those albums where you sit there and like it only because of the beat/hook lol . people that listen to this type of music dont like real hip-hop , as i said theyre blind . people that arent big hip-hop fans , i dont criticize you for listening , but all you people that claim to be hip-hop fans , f * * * outta here , you aint . this album is for commercial rap listeners only , if you like underground stay away from this at all costs . pick up some real hiphop instead . peace .
i had high hopes for this . after spending $ 24.95 to buy it , and watching the first disc , i do n't even feel inspired to watch the other discs . i am an alcoholic myself , and have been sober ( thanks to aa ) for <NUM> plus years . i work in the medical field , and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis . i found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing . perhaps it just shows the hunger of the american people to learn something , anything about the subject of addiction . it is a complex subject , and i did n't find any answers here . i 'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was . if it was strictly to educate , i found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that did't include some of the most important ideas about addiction . it was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you could n't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing , to boot ! if it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction , i did n't feel in the least bit inspired . i did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling , or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling . i left the show vaguely confused , not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers . there were exceptions , of course . i enjoyed the night in the ed segment , and i found the steamfitters to be very `` real '' and human . addiction is a terrible disease , and it deserves better treatment than this . probably the main thing that i did not like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards `` magic bullet '' thinking , which does a disservice to the addict . that is , over and over are mentioned `` exciting new medicines '' and `` getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict '' , which i find dangerous and misleading . that is , it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new `` miracle '' drugs touted . perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry . `` miracle drugs '' which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years ( antabuse and ssri antidepressants come to mind ) , and none have a very impressive track record . in fairness to the show , they do mention some of this , but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next `` miracle drug '' . i was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans , scientific speculation , and such , that there was no mention whatsoever of any <NUM> step program , or any proven treatment center such as hazeldon or the betty ford clinic . because the reality is , while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine , there are real humans out there in the world who are successfully helping their fellow humans to get clean and sober . what a concept ! and without miracle drugs even ! getting clean and sober is not easy , and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a ) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything , and b ) not to mention real life programs available now ( often free ) that have proven track records , and offer real hope . if you like science , be aware that alcoholics anonymous has been shown scientifically in study after study to have the single best track record at keeping alcoholics sober . is it for everyone ? no , but if you want to get ( and more importantly stay ) sober , the odds are better with aa as a follow-up ( after initial treatment ) than with anything else that you can name . `` it works if you work it '' as they say in aa . i have no direct experience with other <NUM> step programs , and so ca n't comment , but i know that they operate very similarly . why on a show about addiction would they not mention any <NUM> step program ? i sat with my jaw hanging down as i watched the entire show , and aa was only mentioned twice : once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for <NUM> years or something `` through aa '' , ( that in itself is an amazing accomplishment , and should say all you need to know about aa ) , and later in the show on the steamfitters who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to aa would be somehow 'wimpy ' for manly men like them . i do n't where they got that impression , because i 've never heard of aa being called 'wimpy ' ( or whatever term they used ) . aa 's full of bikers , construction workers , etc. , right alongside the doctors and lawyers . that 's the beauty of it : it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries , and shows what we addicts have in common . the irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is almost exactly like an aa group and meeting ! i was laughing - there was almost no difference . so if you want to know what an aa meeting is like , watch the steamfitters . the sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts . and the power of `` it takes one to know one '' that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why aa is so effective . who wants to listen to a scientist ? if you 're an addict or an alcoholic , you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic . they 've walked a mile in your shoes . so to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah , blah , blah with little real inspirational meat or insight . if you want some real scientific insight into how this `` brain disease '' works ( at least the alcoholic version ) , try the book `` beyond the influence '' , available from amazon . good meat there . if you want to see some good talk from people who have ( to me ) better insight into the whole addiction thing , search online for the larry king live addiction show which featured jamie lee curtis and betty ford 's daughter from the betty ford clinic . transcripts are available online . it was an incredible show . coincidentally , one of the `` researchers '' who appears on the hbo special was also on the larry king show , and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level . you will see what i 'm talking about .
i ca n't judge the tai chi but the yoga in this video was not well done . the producers hired attractive women with gorgeous bodies and large breasts -- but no yoga skills . so this video does not combine the beauty of yoga with the beauty of the human body . it would be absolutely wonderful to have a talented and flexible yoga instructor do yoga postures correctly ... and in a manner that is intentionally sexually explicit and erotic . i do n't see any problem with that . probably few if any dedicated yoga instructors would consider doing that sort of video . i 'm sure it would be frowned upon by the serious yoga community which might consider it degrading . so we end up with a second rate product like this video . too bad . nevertheless , i do enjoy watching these women show us their bodies
i watched this and would have probably liked it if the people who made this video had taken the time to produce a decent product . the lecture volume swings from low to extremely distorted and at times can not be heard much at all . it was very disappointing considering the price and during the lecture will henry had slides that he presents with use of a laser pointer and you have no idea of what he is really showing to you or pointing to on those slides which are also barely legible on the video . my advice would be to pass on this one it isnt worth the time it takes to watch even if you got it for free .
despite the praise heaped on this text , i ca n't help feeling that bernard faure has been constructing the 'straw men ' other readers have spotted . it is by no means certain that the ch'an ( zen ) tradition has functioned as faure suggests . why , for instance , set up the 'anti-scriptural ' argument - only to concede - on proper investigation , that it is a myth ? there are enough commentaries - on the sutras , by zen monks , to make this sort of thing seem pointless . sorry , but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened , faure style .
this is easily the most boring book i have ever had to read for a class . while the case studies are fairly interesting and thought-provoking , the actual instructional portions of the book are very dry and hard to read
i 'm as big a fan of `` the adventures of the mad scientists ' club '' and `` the new adventures of the mad scientists ' club '' as anyone is . i loved those books to death as a kid , and even today , as i re-read the first two books , they 're still as funny and clever as i remember -- my memories are not clouded by nostalgia . i became a scientist ( for real ) because of those two books . however , `` the big ker-plop '' , despite a promising beginning , just is n't as good . it starts out great : it 's wonderful to be with the boys again as they go fishing on a foggy morning in strawberry lake , and somethign big falls from the sky and lands somewhere in the water ... to be back on strawberry lake again with these brainy , energetic boys is terrific , and right away there 's a mystery to solve . the boys enlist the aid of henry mulligan to find the object that fell in the lake , and how they do it -- using some trigonometry and a magnetometer -- is described with scientific accuracy , believeable , clever and entertaining . it 's such a relief to have a plot where problems are solved by something other than harry potter 's wand . but after the boys tell the air force where they found the object , the plot seriously bogs down . for all intents and purposes , the boys are n't really involved in the plot thereafter , except as observers and ( maybe ) engineers . the boys just invent solutions to problems -- and they are clever solutions , described with scientific accuracy . but the air force does all the `` action '' , and the boys just watch them through a telescope as the adults try to retrieve the lost atomic bomb . i understand that it 's realistic that the air force would go after a lost atomic bomb themselves , and would not let any civilians anywhere near the site -- yes , realistic , but it makes for a boring story . it 's not fun anymore when the adults do all the work . the adults are an important part of the story , and the adult characters are all paper-thin cliches ( the good-hearted air force colonel , the hard-bitten reporter , the fat news photographer ) , uninteresting . brinley was a brilliant plotter , able to write plausible real-world stories with clever twists -- but he had a major defect as a writer : he loved to write `` clever '' dialogue full of ripostes and `` witty '' put-downs , which in fact were never clever or funny . the adults do a lot of talking in this book -- whole chapters consist of their dialogue -- and when the idiot mayor of mammoth falls is engaging in `` clever '' repartee with the barber or some other adult , the witticisms are so unfunny , it just makes me wince
do n't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful ! this book was supposed to be so good , according to the other reviews , and it 's definitely not a good novel . in fact , this is by far the worst novel i have read in my life . i think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line . indeed , it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher . the edition of the book i read was slightly over <NUM> pages , and it could have easily been reduced to <NUM> without affecting in any way the plot line . thus the reader is left to swallow <NUM> pages of pointless writing that just seems like `` waffling '' to mention the term used in england to describe writing that leads you no where . not only that , but the <NUM> pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway . the plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible ; a prince who is an `` idiot '' but on occasions does n't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of `` idiocy '' that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine . moreover , one of the principal characters in the novel , aglaia yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am i the only one here who thinks this is just a little implausible ? and then just to make matters worse , and as an appetizer after having to swallow <NUM> pages of horrible writing , near the end of the novel dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the catholic religion i have read in my life . supposedly , according to dosteyvski , atheism comes from the catholic religion - certainly dosteyevski does n't hide his hatred for the catholic faith . even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition
there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd . i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah , but the rest of the cd left me cold . i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them , it would have been better ! i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy .
i wanted to like brotherhood , for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it , usually with a faint whiff of snobbery ( or at least apathy ) . turns out they were right : brotherhood is half an album . most of its nine songs feel unfinished , as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their <NUM> smash low-life and did n't care about the end result . brotherhood is a rush job , plain and simple , but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort . `` as it is when it was '' overcomes the album 's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic , and the melody is quite lovely . `` all day long '' , the emotional centerpiece of the album by default , is an intelligent ( if half-hearted ) protest against child abuse . while `` angel dust '' lacks a decent hook , its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest . and the toss-off `` every little counts '' has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order 's work . the most popular song on brotherhood is , of course , `` bizarre love triangle '' . so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely , `` bizarre love triangle '' is truly new order 's masterpiece . the solid beat , slick sequencer work , and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best : catchy , danceable , and downright euphoric . ( imagine how well it would have fit on low-life . ) sadly , the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable . the album 's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes , which has become new order 's signature sound , but the songwriting does n't measure up . buy the album if you 're a trainspotter , but casual new order fans would be better off picking up low-life or <NUM> 's power , corruption and lies . this one is just a footnote .
i guess if you love country this cd is ok , but for those of us that came to dolly durning her & quot ; <NUM> to <NUM> & quot ; peroid .. this is really horriable music . sorry dolly .... i sold it back to the stor
this book should have been called `` beautiful interior designs that happen to include some home theater gear '' , or `` home theater style '' . it 's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate ht gear , and often in a laughable way . the text is fluffy , thowaway stuff that is irritating to read . the photos are very well done , but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables . of course , without the unsightly cables , there 'd be no audio or video , either . i guess that 's the main thing that got to me -- if you 're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room , at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible . do n't just leave them out altogether . it 's insulting , and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about ht
as indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist , one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man 's exploitation in the big city . mandragora is way too long , relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest
this is a review of the audio book version . this has to be the worst self- help audio book i 've bought . i thought this was going to be a reading of the book , but instead the author rambles on and on - apparently paraphrasing the book . i guess its supposed sound like a friend talking to you but i kept getting annoyed at the author repeating herself two or three times . and where were the <NUM> tips ? i guess the were in there , but i could n't listen to more than a couple tapes . do n't waste your money ... there are much better books out there that give you useful , concrete steps for uncluttering and simplifying your life
in his interminably boring , mice type liner notes , brad mehldau goes to great lengths dispelling the notion that he might sound like bill evans . the message being , ` oh golly , there 's so much more going on in my playing-please . ' well , i can assure you , bill evans he 's not . he would n't qualify to give bill evans a cab ride uptown . matter of fact , he sounds more like watered down keith jarrett-nothing very original going on here . and if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you 're doing-guess what-you ai n't doing squat . as a pianist who 's been playing modern jazz for <NUM> years , i can tell you to sit this set out . and if you want bill evans or keith jarrett , go get the real thing .
this book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories . the book is basically an oversized machinery 's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that do n't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation . if you do a lot of strength of material design i would suggest a machinery 's hand book , or the mcgraw hill mechanical engineering design book which is an excellent p.e . exam reference book . stay away from the roarks formulas for stress & amp ; strain book its more poorly written then the marks
j.k. rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book . the characters personalities were wavering in book <NUM> , in this they completely vanished or mutated . i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way . in books one through four the trio of harry , ron , and hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . book <NUM> had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more whining than day saving . book <NUM> made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done . this book harry seemed to care more about romance . a very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from previous books . a female character from the background , whom harry barely even notices all through the past five books , is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion . several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence . the clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another . the image of harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with malfoy . as to the general plot of the book . poorly done . continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . most of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information , and the culmination of what harry was not-quite-solving did n't amount to anything . my final opinion : do n't bother to read past book <NUM> if you 're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization . a very disappointing book
yayo needs to stick to being a criminal ... but then again he was n't even good at that
i liked it better when it was called alice in chains ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they should call their band zapsmack because i would slap the piercings off the singer if i ever saw that <NUM> lb . wuss . songs about witch craft and all that lame hocus pocus mumbo jumbo is about as played out as king diamond . booooooooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this band . the zappe
this once promising and enjoyable series ( and i have read every book ) has just become too much like an overblown tv soap opera . every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up , it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it 's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode . temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two m 's but we all know that 's only a deception . the one bright spot in the story ( and earlier books had a whole lot more of them ) is on page <NUM> and involves the wonderful fontana brothers doing a james bond imitation . it took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last midnight louie story until the end . and i must say it 's a shocker and i will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches `` z ''
i was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library . just a glance of this book got me on the alert side . although the title of the book bears the name of jesus , it is largely based on the author 's personal meditations than the bible . the author refers very little to the bible . and , the chapter `` rise above karma '' annoys me as it relates `` karma '' to the bible teachings . is not `` karma '' a term for hinduism and buddhism ? what is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of god and jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books . the bible tells us to beware of teachings like this
i 'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story , but it was n't worth the cost of finding it . started reading this and got <NUM> pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references , historical meanderings , and pointless speculations . seems like this book 's real purpose is to test the reader 's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written , intriguing story . it was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings , i think , do so because they 're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth . call me stupid then , but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings . my congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this <NUM> page snooze fest . you have my admiration for your tenacity . i note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful . but take a look at lots of reviews of this book . the majority of them say it is a long , boring slog , then they give it a <NUM> star rating . how helpful is that ?
i am disappointed of this cd because fred hammond and rfc is off the chain but this cd is not . i really wouldnt recommend it becuase they have done better and this cd is a waste of money . if you still want to buy it then you can but i really didnt like it . there were some songs that are good but the rest are wea
oops , mine bad !
i do n't know if i was more disappointed or angered at this little insignificant but dangerous book . the contents has very little to do with what children , who travel to italy , will ever encounter . what i find it does is continue the negative strereotyping of the italians . really ! no one stomps on grapes and a child who will visit a farm in italy will hardly see such outdated stereotypical occurrences . can food be the only thing one would like of italy ? of course , since the book failed to explain what other things of wonder a child might see . i bought this for my grandchildren , as sadly there are very few book on italy with some italian words . i returned the book because i would never introduce italy to my grandchildren this way . a very expensive book that perpatuates outdated images . poor job .
i bought this recording for my <NUM> & <NUM> year-old grandchildren who love ballet . there was nothing in the amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production . the kids and i were half-way through viewing it when i realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture . the principal women ( mom & girlfriend ) were evil and stupid respectively . the `` hero '' s '' true love was an undisguised male swan ( all the swans were male ) . there was no hiding the passion between the male lovers . good grief ! !

i bought usher 's <NUM> on tape long ago , and i remember liking it . then a couple of years ago , i bought it again on cd , listened to it , and wondered why i wasted my money . maybe it 's the fact that i 've grown , but this album sounds so un-soulful now . it is just lacking any spirit , sort of like an over-produced record : all studio magic , but no magic from the singer . even the songs that are supposed to sound heartfelt , do n't . the album sounds dated , not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics . the songs are very forgettable , and i do n't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now . usher has yet to make a masterpiece . addendum : i was a little unfair in my rating . the album deserves <NUM> stars , not <NUM> . unfortunately , i ca n't change it .
ok , first off , this is the first corrs release i 've listenend to . i 'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done . i 've listened to the cd <NUM> times or so , on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock . it sounds good . a little too good . i agree that it 's overproduced , does n't sound even remotely spontaneous . the studio work is well done , but overdone . i 'd like to hear something else to see what they really sound like . the content of the songs is what bothers me . aside from being sappy , sentimental drivvel ( this is pop music , after all - i was n't expecting anything else ) , everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack . mmm-hmm . track <NUM> - i see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at curves ( tm ) , then hopping in the ford expedition ( tm ) , and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a sunnyd ( tm ) in each hand . track <NUM> - helicopter pans out as mid-20 's girl drives curvy mountain road in vw cabrio ( tm ) ( r ) with top down , thinking about handsome lover ... `` lmn '' ( r ) watermark in lower-right corner of screen ... track <NUM> - sad animals . images of puppys in cages . track <NUM> - actually , i like this one . mellow , laid back . track <NUM> - ugh . track <NUM> - this one is the most clever ! i see the band members - <NUM> girls , <NUM> guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room , while <NUM> gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money , push it towards them and say , `` as you 're aware , the radio has lost it 's credibility . the kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there , beside what we pump across the airwaves at them . we need to entice them back . if you want a single , and this pile of cash says you do , then you 'll do what you can to save this dying medium . hell , you work in the word `` radio '' and we 'll double what we 're giving you . '' come on , the song even sounds like a psa for the international radio marketing council ... track <NUM> - sounds like a pepsi commercial . track <NUM> - ugh . wait , was n't this track <NUM> ? track <NUM> - sappy , but ok . sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics . thumbs up . track <NUM> - not remotely original , but alright . track <NUM> - interesting sound . good beat . correct me if i 'm worng , but was that a semi-pagan reference there ? that would be a bold move , for which i 'd applaud them , if in fact it is . not that i 'm pagan or anything , but hey , its a religiously positive , non-christian reference that does n't involve marilyn manson , and that takes guts . especially for radio-loving girls bands . track <NUM> - laid back . almost has a jazzy , lounge feel . track <NUM> - produced by former ace of base member ? bubbly , upbeat , not too bad . track <NUM> - written and produced by avril lavigne ... track <NUM> - wow ! a relatively celtic-sounding song from a relatively celtic band ! ! and instrumental , too - big thumbs up ! in fact , maybe that 's the key . whatever . long-winded , i know , but fair . this album did n't turn me off to the corrs completely , but i do n't have very high hopes now . flame away , kiddies .
i was expecting a well composed novel and ended up with a story instead . have you ever been stuck on the telephone with a friend who insisted on reporting a personal story in a rambled manner while you have better things to do with your time ? or better yet , just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible ? that 's what i felt like while reading this novel . the composition of this novel was , at best , junior high level . and , to top it off , i live in the san francisco bay area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through . i think i 'm going to take bart to the city and abandon the book somewhere in chinatown
drew 's famous party music is a joke . i wish i had read the reviews before i purchased this cd . in the past <NUM> weeks , i have probably ordered <NUM> or <NUM> compilation cd 's looking for great music from the 70s , 80s and <NUM> 's for a party i am hosting . i read the reviews for the other cd 's and they were great , but in my excitement about finding whoomp there it is and love train , i did n't check the reviews for this cd . this cd is not at all what i thought it would be . trust me , this is not the one , it 's not even on the list . i was looking for whoomp there it is , and especially love train by the ojays . not what i got . i excitedly listened to whoomp , and i kept saying this does n't sound right . something sounds like its missing from the song . so i listened to love train , and immediately , i knew that it was not the ojays singing . i realized that none of the original artists were singing . this is a terrible misrepresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i listened to the cd before i played it at the party . i would have been horrified . i wish i could give it less than one star and get a refund . please , please , please do n't waste your money
blum 's biography of harlow does an excellent job of examining the man and the scientist , `` warts and all . '' yes , it 's unflinching in its descriptions of the experiments performed on macaques showing the effects of maternal deprivation ; yes , it 's unflinching on showing the psychology of the man who performed these experiments and the sad effects his psychological predispositions had on his personal life . poor monkeys ! poor harlow ! but never fear ; blum is here to provide us with reassurance : it all had to be that way - really , it did . true , the experiments sound really nasty ; but hey , that 's just how things were done in those days . really , it 's all okay , in the long run , because now , even though we still mus n't question the basic scientific premises regarding the necessity of animal research , at least we do n't have to perform those particular nasty experiments anymore ; and really - really - harlow was , in his own perverted way , something of a hero . even animal rights activists have cause to be thankful to him : because of him , we now have a convenient enemy to vilify , not to mention that desperately needed scientific proof positive that monkeys are more complex than we once believed , and hence deserve a little extra consideration . thank you , harry harlow . thank you , deborah blum , for puffing him back up again after the deflated view you left us with in the monkey wars . see people ? he really was n't such a bad guy after all . all you have to do is look at him in just the right way . . . .
george picked the worst way to show his voice.songs are so boring and he does n't stay in the right key ! save your money and buy bo bice 's new awesome , amazing , album called the real thing ! bo will show you how it 's done ! bo 's the real deal folks ! bo blows all the other idols who ever went on the show out of the water , makes them look real bad , yuck for georgie !
italian music from st. laurent , quebec canada ? i guess that is what one would expect . sounds like a bunch of french-canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-italian bar . it is pretty bad . i do n't know how they get `` gloria '' as an italian favorite . if you want italian cafe music , do n't buy this one . a waste of mone
do n't buy this cd for & quot ; growing away from me & quot ; as the recording sounds like it was burned from an old album , lots of pops and crackling . surely they could have found a better source tape or cleaned it up
dissappointed in this movie , rated pg with profanity in it . i had to throw it away
where are the werewolves is what i kept asking through out this movie , ,i thought the original howling and howling <NUM> were great , this one just do n't measure up , boring but watchable , also who design the back cover ? ? ? ? ? ? ? whoever did , did n't do their homework , because all the pics are from howling <NUM>
i 'd like to give this period tv series higher marks ; i love michael kitchen 's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of detective chief superintendent christopher foyle , and honeysuckle weeks as women 's auxiliary driver `` sam '' stewart is delightful . their interplay really makes the show . it just is n't enough ( for me ) to compensate for many major shortcomings . as other reviewers have pointed out , the show weaves contemporary ( early wwii ) social issues into its plots . not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be extremely off-putting . why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area ? apparently it 's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars ? ! ? worst of all is foyle 's out-of-character sermonizing , which sometimes takes weird turns , as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he 'll be on his case when the war 's over . not only does this make no sense in view of foyle 's previous instructions , but i interpret the capitalist villain 's bemused expression to mean `` thanks for the tip , copper , i 'll be getting off this flight in extradition-free ireland ! ! ! '' d'oh ! well , carry on , inspector ! the show 's designers are also a bit careless with physical period details . usually this is pretty minor stuff , but at least once produces a howler . in the fifty_ships episode , after a lengthy sermon on the crucial importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of u.s. military equipment ( 'even though it 's just moldy american rubbish ' ) , we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a u.s.-made c-47 ( cutting edge in <NUM> ) in raf colours ! ! ! as other reviewers have also pointed out , the stories are relentlessly pc . i have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services ; i 'm sure that 's true of all armies . but after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman , prejudiced patriot , and cowardly bourgeois i switched to sherlock ! the unforgivable sin , however , is the cheesy plotting . it 's not just that it 's formulaic and predictable , but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow foyle to 'detect . ' do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until foyle pulled a columbo with the tea bag ? is there a gosford park near this police station ? in conclusion , there 're far superior brit and , yes , u.s. detective shows out there . if you like it pc try morse ; if you 're into period try poirot , wimsey , or the hickson marple . leave foyle unless you 're desperate
the left behind series is the best reading i have ever read . i admit my reading is not all that much , but when i read the very first book i was hooked , i read all twelve books in about six weeks . they lead me to understand the bible better . thank you tim and jerry for such great books . corrine robinson
in <NUM> during the ( good ridance ) time of your life craze they released a cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life .
i was enjoying the travel parts of the book , despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by mr. crichton , until i reached the part where he was in bangkok . he teams up with a journalist for a night on the town . his journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area 's many brothels . finally , after testing the waters , the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and suggests a child whorehouse . crichton does n't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him . instead , he goes and checks the place out . he gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes . perhaps i 'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile . i did n't expect crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex was n't his thing , instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him . this infuriated me and turned my stomach . i threw the book in the trash . i wish publishers had done the same . fyi , there is no zero star option
this rugrats movie is the worst of the three . obviously , it was made for promotion and cash more than anything . nickelodeon did n't consider the plot in the process , so the movie suffers . the plot is complex , yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously , and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots . the movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp . since rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds , they wo n't get it . the main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [ also , burger king promotion to go with that ] , and the fact that spike would now talk . hah ! spike talked in the episode of the series about chuckie 's dreams . besides , smelling some disgusting card [ that you can smell anytime , not during the movie ] is n't fun . the burger smells more like spoiled milk . anyway , the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dose n't happen . debbie 's well-publicized line and the & quot ; that is so wrong ! & quot ; line , and the wedgie-dance , are among the stupidest things i have ever seen . maybe an 8-year-old would disagree . being <NUM> , i found the humour pretty dumb . so you 're aware , i love the series . this movie just was n't creative at all , it was more of a thornberry-type flick . and finally , it just is n't whimsical or special in any way . not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store , if that
i was very disappointed in this video , keb-mo was good , but there was very little of him playing , actually there was very little playing by anyone . the interviews were fine , but you find yourself waiting for the music to start , and when it did , it did n't last.it is alright , not great by any means , i would be hard pressed to buy it for more than a couple dollars
forgive me , but after watching this festering pustule of a movie i 've simply got to rant a bit . i normally do n't trash films , but this one deserves it so badly ... i 'm sorry . this is a movie that 's about as interesting as watching grass grow . a chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting . i wish i could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a `` <NUM> star '' as the lowest . i ca n't remember a movie where the audience 's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon . you know when you go to someone 's house and they show you home movies of their trip to the beach ? and you have to sit through two hours of not much going on while their kids play in the sand ... and you keep looking at your watch wondering when it will ever end ? well , that 's `` raiders of the lost ark '' compared to `` open water <NUM> '' . the three stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie , the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes ed wood look like martin scorcese . maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make ... because if not , those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste . pretentious , annoying , stupid on a monumental level . this movie makes catwoman , basic instinct <NUM> , jaws <NUM> , etc . all look like citizen kane .
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on .... really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers . there are so many open ends in the story ... chartacters are not distinctly outlined ... tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard ( of sports night fame ) was scowling hard , trying to be a tough detroit cop . not believable for a nanosecond . and then it got worse when marky mark said , `` why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee ? '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichÔøΩd rhythm . almost every scene in this thing is a howler . and watching it , i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was <NUM> fast <NUM> furious . still , tyrese is better than garrett hedlund , who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders . but the movie 's not a total wash ; after all , it 's got a great soundtrack
this film began as a beautiful european historical period piece , in paris , which lush costumes , gorgeous people , etc . but after an hour , it deteriorated into incredibly boring melodrama with binoche placed in alternating picturesque european cities and sex scenes . no deep emotions are penetrated , more than many other binoche vehicles like `` chocolat '' and `` the horseman on the roof '' . i could n't wait for it to end -- it 's <NUM> hours seemed like <NUM>
i watched this dogg-o with some japanese folks i know and let me tell ya all of thought it was the most boring , obvious , dated bore we 'd laid eyes on in many a moon . and these guys are from a very wealthy , aristocratic , old japanese family at the vanguard of westernization in the 50s . stay awa
i love dave 's tv show , it 's really hilarious , so i was expecting a lot when i bought this dvd as part of a two-pack with richard pryor . after <NUM> minutes of dave , i started thinking , `` when am i going to laugh ? '' after <NUM> minutes , i got bored so i started listening to the audience for this live show . they were laughing ( a little ) & not all that often , so i concluded that it was n't just my mood , this just was n't funny . after <NUM> minutes , i turned it off . i can tell you that the first <NUM> minutes is a waste of your time , even if you 're a dave fan , as i am . i ca n't tell you if the rest is funny or not , because i did n't watch it . maybe i was expecting too much . maybe i was expecting richard pryor , which i had watched first . my recommendation is either to buy only the pryor dvd ( which is terrific ) , or watch the chappelle dvd first , so it wo n't suffer by comparison
ryuichi sakamoto 's credibility is on the precipice with chasm , a turgid unlistenable work of crud . check out coro and only love can conquer hate , both sound like factory machinery at work . dire , dreadful and diabolical . stop being the artiste ryuichi and have a go at entertaining . your fans deserve better
i 'm glad that i got this book out from the library instead of buying it . it provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup , and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they 're straight from the <NUM> 's . i really do n't know anyone who wears scarves , overalls , or blouses to school . the language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated . i actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a <NUM> 's book ; it 's a <NUM> book . ms. youngs even uses the <NUM> 's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors . it 's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one 's looks and `` beauty diversity '' , yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls . the author herself was a miss teen claifornia finalist , so i suppose one coul n't expect much more . i would avoid buying this for a young girl , or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl
i am a howard stern fanatic and a softball fanantic . i could n't go wrong with this movie , right ? wrong ! it is pretty bad . i was disappointed with artie 's project . gross jokes terrible acting . there are a couple of funny scenes . wait until it is on sale
this is a pretty good collection for the mickey beginner . i would n't purchase it however if you already have the walt disney treasures `` mickey mouse in living color '' series because all the shorts are on those dvds as well
that 's basically my two cents . shallow characters , bizarre story . i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films , but i do like a good story and heard this was one . it was not . all of the characters were inverted - ada and her daughter were utterly irritating , george was disgusting from start to finish , and sam neill 's character ( supposedly the heartless jerk ) was actually the easiest to sympathize with . how frustrating ! on a positive note , michael nyman 's score is unbelievable . i love it
this is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way . the author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way . this book is not a guide to the fretboard , it is basic music theory for absolute beginners . if you want rock solid information about the guitar 's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does : get fretboard logic . the author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one . this one is a mel bay retread
if there is one thing that rings true of the editor 's review , it 's that robert spencer is `` lawyerly '' - but not in the sense the editor meant , rather in the sense that he deliberately twists the facts in order to argue his case despite the facts . this book is full of misquotations of the sayings of muhammad ( ahadith ) , and they are obviously deliberate as mr. spencer has taken the time to research the ahadith and yet still makes enormous errors in his rendering of them . he spends a considerable amount of time quoting from the bible and comparing his interpretation of the christian doctrine ( which i would guess a great many christains will have issue with , as well ) with what he claims to be the message of islam . he also spends a great deal of time attempting to assassinate the personality of muhammad with the argument that muhammad is the role model for all muslims - hence by assasinating this personality he hopes to assasinate the character of islam and all muslims . despite his opening claim that he is not targeting all muslims , the goal of his book , really , is to draw suspicion upon every muslim in america from their non-muslim neighbors . his basic premise that islam in essence is a falsehood and that all muslims have deceived themselves with a backward and dated belief system that has failed to evolve , as he puts it , as christianity has evolved from its backwardness by reducing the bible to strictly metaphorical meanings . the crux of his arguement is that christianity is able to do this , because , as christian scholars have shown , the bible is in fact not the direct word of god , but the quran , on the other hand , is taken by muslims as the direct , revealled word of god and hence there is little or no room for the religion to be re-interpreted . if one reads ( or listens , in the case of the audio book ) carefully , though , it will not be hard to find the many instances in which mr. spencer contradcits himself . all in all , it does read like a lawyer making his case in court , where it is islam itself that is on trial . mr. spencer seems to be trying to establish that the likes of osama bin laden are in fact only following the letter of their religion , and hence islam is a danger to be feared and reacted to preemtively . mr. spencer seems to have strong political and religious motivations and is a far cry from his claim of being unbiased
i saw this movie in the theater some almost <NUM> years ago with my then partner and i definately remember the love making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness . but the scene is completely gone in the dvd , as well as the kiss . now why in the world would they cut that out ! ! ! ? ? ? that was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time , it was on the cutting edge . one star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie `` making love ''
a prestigious scientist ( scharwzenegger ) is embraced by artificial insemination testing by himself a new pharmacological device . in spite of the existence of several funny humor blows , it predominates along the picture coarse humor , signed by a permissive and excessively didactic vision of the sex . to be true , there is a potent allegation respect the familiar institution and the motherhood virtue . the fact is that a good chance was wasted about regain the magic of those classic comedies directed by wilder or hawks . but anyway , let ' s make an imagination exercise ; mel brooks directing , with a six hands script written by robin williams , billy cristal and danny de vito would have been a major successful premise . but all comparisons sound hateful , perhaps . don ` t you ?
i do n't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on . this dude keeps rappin ' about where he 's from and junk like that . it 's like he does n't have anything else to say . while the production may be okay ( it 's questionable ) the lyrics just plain suck . hey fiend give dr. dre a call
it 's amazing just how quickly i decided this movie really sucks . a music video without the music ! for the usa today , mtv , no attention span generation ! with exclamation points ! however , just to be fair and because i had nothing better to do , i endured <NUM> minutes . give me a medal ! tom cruise looks better with mustache , beard , gray hair . jamie foxx 's talents are wasted here . it 's writing like this that makes us realize that aaron spelling was much better than we gave him credit for .
i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average `` bad guys on the run '' movie . gee , billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all ; he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel . this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
a 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality , this swedish import does n't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place , would n't know what to do with it if you did have it , and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts . the plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as `` well-worn , '' which seems to be a euphemism for `` shop-worn , '' `` clichÔøΩ , '' or `` stupefyingly unoriginal . '' here it is ( spoilers follow ) : daniel , a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health , returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood , takes over and revives the local church choir , heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness , finds love , finds his inner child , and finally , at the moment of his and his choir 's greatest triumph , croaks . a great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program , but kay pollack is n't up to it . instead , in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness , he celebrates , embraces , wallows in the schmaltz , throws it at you until it 's dripping off you like oobleck , and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film . indeed , there 's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last : it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent , albeit of the ed wood variety ; and while watching it i almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind , as in the kingsley amis story about the poet who , at the end of a long and successful career , publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs . ( speaking of whom : `` as it is in heaven '' was nominated for best foreign film at the oscars in <NUM> , after being strewn with similar honors in sweden , where it was reportedly seen by some two million viewers . we 're used to this kind of idiocy from the academy , but what 's going on in the country of strindberg and bergman ? has someone been putting something in the kÔøΩttbullar ? ) a standard feature of movies like this ( and books like this , if it comes to that -- cf . ayn rand ) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant . aiiih is no exception . the parade of didactic marionettes includes : -- daniel 's love interest , a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde , who represents the life force ; -- the humorless , sexually repressed , hypocritical preacher , who represents the church , which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity , especially in modern scandinavia ; -- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates , and then finally locks up and forgives -- who represents violence and what to do about it ; -- the retarded kid whom daniel insists on letting into the choir , chiefly so that he can become the film 's symbol of the virtues of inclusiveness and the deep human wisdom of special people . ( incidentally , it 's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people , in movie after movie , as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence , or whatever , is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them ; it just seems nicer . ca n't we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being ? the only one i can recall seeing is `` best boy , '' a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about <NUM> years ago . apart from that they 've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule , as in `` there 's something about mary , '' or turned into plaster saints as here . ) so , to sum up : save your money and your time , which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of `` the o.c . '' run , do n't walk , from your local art theater if this is the main attraction . and do n't forget the moral of the story , rather comforting to me as an expatriate american living in a europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-ÔøΩ-vis the usa : kitsch is global .
i used to enjoy iris johansen . this book is a super natural psychic thing . the book flap describes it as `` psychological thriller '' , but it 's not . if you enjoy the super natural type of book ( stephen king , etc ) then this is good . if , like me , you dislike that type of book , stay away from this one . the main character kerry can get into peoples minds . the other main character also does that . yes , that is the basis of this book
the summoning and the seige were both enjoyable , but despite a decent first half , the last <NUM> or so pages of the sorcerer were more or less unreadable . shame , because this was otherwise a pretty good series
juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career . he marinated on the underground until cash money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s . but then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer . even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down , leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there . b.g . went the independent route , holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a hot boy . turk followed suit , but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars . juvenile found himself going the solo route , although he did briefly return in <NUM> for juve the great . now with atlantic , juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release reality check . `` get your hustle on '' is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead . `` i know you know '' with trey songz is a good contender for the radio . `` around the way '' is a song for the hood to know that he ai n't never left and he does n't plan to either . `` sets go up '' with wacko is so-so , while his first single `` rodeo '' is the millennium version of `` back that [ ... ] up '' only with a more subdued approach . unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there . `` what 's happenin ' '' is nothing to write home about , `` loose booty '' is another song devoted to the [ ... ] -shaking community , and `` break a brick down '' deliberately borrows a beat from another cash money track . `` who 's ya daddy '' is pointless , along with the annoying `` keep talkin ' '' with skip and redd eyezz and `` why not . '' bun b makes another poor decision by collaborating on `` rock like that . '' the biggest shocker has to be `` addicted '' with brian mcknight making a dumb career move . not only does brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time ( and hopefully his last , ) but juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them ( think oran juice jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of `` the rain . '' ) there are a lot of other dreadful songs on reality check that i 'm not even going to bother mentioning . this has to be the worst disc that juvenile has ever put together in recent memory . with an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable , reality check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and ca n't live with yourself if you do n't buy the album . one thing is for sure ... juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come .
this movie is okay if you like low budget gangsta movies without any plot . people compare this movie to city of god and i have to wonder what they 've been smoking . this movie is just like any of the other straight to dvd movies starring a rappper except its about jamacans in miam
science , properly understood , means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one 's peers . this was not done with mccrone 's `` proof '' obtained only by mccrone using his `` instruments '' . no verification by reputable laboratories equals taking mccrone 's `` proof '' as a matter of faith .......... in mccrone . a fool 's choice
rest stop is a pretty bad straight to dvd horror flick . it 's the same old `` redneck rampage '' style serial killer flick . but the plot is just in shambles and does n't make much sense . only about <NUM> minutes of this movie is worth seeing . by the way , you know a movie is bad when joey lawrence is the best actor in it . i 'll give it this much ... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there
i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys . with tweedy 's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris ' departure from the jayhawks , i was hoping we 'd see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris ' `` rainy day music '' was released . now , while there are some really good songs here , nothing really comes close to the `` red-headed stepchilds , '' `` radio kings , '' or `` jennifer save mes . '' the album lacks something but i ca n't put my finger on it . it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus . considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around , drinking beer , and goofing off , this album feels wrong . it does n't have that sing-along feel ( with the exception of possibly one or two songs ) that the first couple albums ( and even ep ) had . just a little lackluster and , considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one , almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throw-aways
this is an awful record . the beats are a complete joke . whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin ' , cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh * * see the light of day . and everyone already knows ja ca n't write so it 's expected that the lyrics would be trash too . forget this record . murder inc is dead
this author claims that the baudelaire children can not see through count olaf 's disguises , which is patently absurd , as any reader of the snicket series would know . she has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim , and i would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy , let alone to anyone to read . either she did n't read the books , did n't really absorb what she read , or most likely , merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on snicket 's good name . do n't read this book , do n't get it from a library , it is a big waste of time .
i ca n't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds ! soul asylum released an absolute winner with `` hang time '' , a perfect blend of pop , punk and metal . with `` and the horse they rode in on '' , i am truly baffled as to what happened . first off , even if you actually like the music here in , the cover is god awful ! ! ! and that title ! what was going on dave pirner 's mind ? ! ? ! now , before you lovers of this album hang me , this release has its moments . `` spinning '' starts off great and it 's a great follow up song to the `` hang time '' album . but from there , the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks . and the production makes soul asylum sound as bland as your favorite jell-o flavor . for an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point . the songs sound as if something 's about to happen , but in the end we are left wondering what happened . the irony of it all is that soul asylum 's so called `` sell out '' album ( you know what album ! ) has more balls than this release ! ! ! sad but true , but what 's even sadder is that dave pirner is actually a good songwriter and i 'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out
i purchased this for my <NUM> year old son . i am so thankful that i read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it . the pictures are hand drawn but graphic . far too much detail for the target audience . kids need to know about sexuality but they do n't need to know everything before they are even teen-agers . i would be upset to find this in a school library . this book definitely needs to be used with supervision . i returned this book as i believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of <NUM> years old .
just kidding . actually , massachusetts has nothing to worry about . the people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as martians would ( an effect fellini was deliberately going for ) . the only reason i rented this disc is because john lennon once said that the beatles ' life on tour was like fellini 's satyricon . i can only hope that the fab four 's nights in australia , the philippines , and japan were more fun than this movie . more a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative , satyricon ( just how does one pronounce it anyway ? ) bets eveything on its visuals . some work and are impressive , but after a half hour , even diehard film buffs will tire of watching fellini try to top himself every five minutes . i hated fellini 's la dolce vita . but , being a good sport , i decided to give the famed italian director one more shot by watching this . i do n't think i want to go for strike three anytime soon . one could pretty much watch the scenes in any order . as an added annoyance , it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming , just like they did in the spaghetti westerns . since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists , one only has imagery to go on . so , let me describe the movie in montage form . we see large slabs of meat , bonfires , fat pedophiles , fat homosexuals , thin homosexuals , a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice , an annoying poet with a beautiful voice . there are midgets , galley slaves , oily wrestling matches , a sweaty minotaur , heads chopped off , mutilations , suicides , a man swinging from a noose , lots of froliking , little real sex and no eroticism , an earthquake , sabers , centaurians , dusty vistas , squeaky wagons , a pasty-faced demi-god , painted woman , painted men , loin cloths , art work , and as cosmo kramer once said , lots of unbridled enthusiasm . what does it all add up to ? two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted . if you want great imagery in a foreign film , stick with werner herzog 's work .
after a man is caught cheating in a poker game a lynch party is formed and the man is murdered . soon after the murderers begin dying violent and mysterious deaths . dean martin plays a ramblin ' gambler in five card stud , a movie that probably did n't , but certainly could have , pounded the fatal nail into the traditional western before handing the franchise over to the italians . although it sells itself as a mystery/western - who 's killing all these gambling varmints , anyhow ? - a five-second study of the movie 's poster will pretty much shuffle out who 's the good guy , who 's the bad guy , and who 's going to ride into the sunset with inger stevens . i watched this movie the first time years and years ago , back in the knee-britches days . it 's possible some of synapses fired and connected and i somehow , after a generation plus , remembered how the plot - and i use that term loosely - ran . i doubt it , though . five card stud does n't bother itself with keeping an edge to the mystery . robert mitchum plays a gun-toting preacher who opens a church soon after the lynching occurs , roddy mcdowell is an angry young man with a chip on his shoulder . katherine justice plays the shapely tomboy sister of mcdowell and inger stevens is wasted , again , as a hair-cutting floozie . both women , of course , have lips puckered for the six-shootin ' gambling man martin . this one was pretty excruciating , and it 's really tempting to blame it all on the bored , and boring , martin . that 's probably not fair , though . the script is murky , the dialogue laughable ( at the wrong times , ) and , like i said , the mystery is never all that much of a mystery . martin , like mitchum , was best in movies that let him play it laid-back and coolly bemused . he needs manic energy to react to - think shirley maclaine , a young sally fields , or even jerry lewis . he does n't have the chops to carry a movie without someone like that , though . mitchum could , but the movie does n't put him at the center . it would n't matter anyway , because the only hope for this trite oater would be razing the story and starting over . about the only fun this one provides - besides a scene with mitchum and yaphet kotto near the end - is trying to decide who looks more bored , martin or mitchum . my money 's on mitchum , but martin gives him a go at it . a waste of a good cast , and , save for a scene or two , a waste of a viewer 's time .
the book is well written , and is primarely about watches produced in the usa , and pocket watches at that . there are a lot of illustrations , and describtions of most of the principles of the art of watchmaking
tipsy and hood hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible . this was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass wo n't make another album or will step his game up . xxx was n't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and i do n't recommend buying this trash at all . if you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get <NUM> cent 's massacre album instead or even ja rule 's r.u.l.e . those are n't classics but they are much better than this garbage
oh please , however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop , for some one who has been listen to it for years , calling her music hip hop is an insult
i waited to receive this copy from the us , and when i checked it out it was very bad quality.thick of the worst video you have , and i think you can understand.i certainly wo n't be buying anything off this studio again.i do recommend dvds from red sun , hong kong legends and vengeance video are ok . the film is a masterpiece of classic kung fu , but the quality is dire.i hope red sun release it
i am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here . this starts kim 's long descent into his boogie demise . if you want to hear savoy brown at their finest and the music that gave them their acclaim , buy `` looking in '' and `` raw sienna '' . if you like the blues side of their music get `` blue matter '' . but by the time this album came out , the magic was gone
this movie has been done over and over again , with different actors and by different directors , but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring . do n't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind .... buy something original or save your money
legend of the eight samurai is just as bad as you 'd think it should be . the plot bounces around in a most confusing fashion , but who cares about what 's going on , anyway ? the word samurai is interchanged with ninja in this story . the cast includes such characters as the princess , necktie ninja , pantsless samurai , unloved lady ninja , elvis samurai , the evil queen , the old lady who tears her own face off , and a bevy of poisonous women . throw in tentacles and glowing blue balls , and the mst3k-style jokes happen all on their own . for ease of comprehension , all you need to remember is that the way of the samurai is death , and expect a final deathcount of shakespearian proportions
several images are blurred out . do not purchase this unless you want a censored version . the vhs version from astro video is uncut with no images blurred and has the original music
first of all : i love this movie ! ! ! i give it five stars and more ! but what is your problem with selling a perfect dvd to make your buyers happy ? i saw the movie years ago in germany in the original format and language . the beautiful song : `` when love is gone '' was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in widescreen format ! so ... what is your problem to release the dvd with these features . do you want to make even more money , by saying in a couple of years : `` sorry , we made a mistake . but here 's a new dvd with all of the features for only xx.xx $ ? i 'd recommend to all of the fans : `` do n't buy this dvd ! ! ! '' do n't play into the hands of these big corporations ! !
the `` hardest thing '' i 've ever had to do is listen to this cd , february <NUM> , <NUM> recently i had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man . i was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory , where i put paper clips into cardboard boxes , when i passed a man asking for spare change . i apologized because i had none to give him , and he handed me this cd . `` take this , '' he said in his grizzled wino voice . `` i tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it . '' so i brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while i was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress , angela adams . i wish i had not put it in the cd player , because the music that came out was really not that good . imagine if the backstreet boys met o-town for dinner , and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat . n'sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed , but nick lachey steps forward and says , `` no , n'sync ! go away ! we do n't want any danceable beats or r & b flava in our music ! '' so justin timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks . not only is the <NUM> degrees music boring , but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues . <NUM> . the font which is used to write the words `` and rising '' is an unfortunate choice . the components of the `` d '' in `` and '' are not joined as tightly as they might be , so the `` d '' looks like an `` al . '' this changes the name of the album significantly . <NUM> . the boys are standing in front of a wall of fire , which i assume is supposed to be a reference to their name , <NUM> degrees , which is a warm temperature . however , any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than <NUM> degrees . human beings are hotter than <NUM> degrees , usually by about .6 degrees , and they burn when put into fire . in fact , <NUM> degrees the temperature is not that hot , just like <NUM> degrees the performing group . <NUM> . several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band 's name on their arms . how lame is that ? can you imagine if people in all bands did that ? i bet emma bunton would feel really lame right now , what with the spice girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture . what 's that ? <NUM> degrees is no more ? no one buys their music ? nick lachey is best known as mr. jessica simpson ? ha ha ! bet you 're glad you got that tattoo now , sucker ! i recommend you not buy this cd . buy anything else instead . i hear britney spears is genius
i love the foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties . of course everyone has heard `` baby now that i 've found you '' and `` build me up buttercup '' , but they had so many great songs . i had a ten inch compilation from the early'80 's with about ten songs , all of which are on this disc . they would 've fit in very well with a lot of the motown groups , although they were a multi-racial english band . i mistakenly gave this recording one star when i intended five .
& # <NUM> ; in the end , it appears that by `` anti-catholic prejudice '' , jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the roman catholic church with sufficient reverence . he would probably characterize most of the practicing catholics i know as near-heretical . jenkins uses related but distinct words like `` bigotry '' and `` prejudice '' interchangeably . it is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming `` prejudice '' , which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders , is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former catholics . i refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line . the book is quite interesting , containing a vast amount of information , including a lot which seems to argue against jenkin 's point . i do n't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it . jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various `` liberation '' movements that have arisen in the wake of the civil rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s . to this end , he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one 's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent , i.e. , the anti-catholicism of nativists and know-nothings . if he really wants to trace the history of protestant/catholic conflict , he needs to go back to the reformation at least . it would also be appropriate to mention the vatican 's anti-americanism during the same period ; many churches were offended that americans considered the people , rather than god , to be the legitimate source of political power . in any case , it is irrelevant , since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-catholic prejudice , such as the fundamentalist protestant groups who regard the pope as the anti-christ . jenkins 's real foe is people whose argument with the catholic church is not really religious but social . representatives of the church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and i ca n't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates . they all enter at the same level , however , and those who participate in the brawl of public debate ( excuse me , the marketplace of ideas ) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism , although i shall always hope , often in vain , for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints . jenkins feels that the church should be accorded special reverence by all ; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry . the church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts . to jenkins , any dispute between the church and any other group , including dissenting catholics , is proof of anti-catholic prejudice . he would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent , but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place . jenkins mentions that the masons were originally welcoming to catholics , but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the church hierarchs , became decidely less friendly . jenkins blames the masons for the ill-will , even though he admits that the church threw the first rhetorical punch . in many ways , jenkins does as much as any `` no-nothing '' to argue that `` real '' catholics are unable to live in a secular , multireligious society . it is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear . i share jenkins ' outrage at the invasion of st. patrick 's cathedral by act-up , but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded ; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled . i have enough sympathy for the points that jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that i would expect to be charged with homophobia . as an outsider , i would not presume to tell the church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages . at the same time , if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society , it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints . jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia . the issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the church to deal with the issue . people being what they are , this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than <NUM> years , yet the church seems baffled . some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the church and its policy of celibacy over the head , but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the church to deal with erring priests . jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors , forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long . the church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests
when i listened to this cd i actually expected to hear gloria estafan singing on some of these songs . some of them seem like they were written for her . wild card has a few good songs on it . the title track is okay . moonlight and king of hearts are better . the last good cd by the rippington 's was weekend in monaco . changes in personnel , locations , and labels have n't proved to be too good for russ 's music . he 's made his money and can experiment with various ideas . wild card is loser in my opinion , but at least it 's better than brave new world
while i enjoy greenberg 's radio show , i was extremely disappointed in this book . throughout the book , greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio . unfortunately , unlike on the radio , when mike golic is always available to slap some sense into greenberg , this book is purely <NUM> % greenberg . i am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives , yet try to act like they have `` struggled '' in life . greenberg has had to `` struggle '' thru a cushy upbringing , going to exclusive schools such as northwestern and eventually landing his gig at espn . for those of you in the chicago area , i hope that you caught debra pickett 's article on greenberg in the chicago sun-times . while greenberg professes to be a family man , the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic , himself , while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool . keeping with his privileged existence , the pool was located at the east bank club in chicago , yet another privileged club to which greenberg belongs . i should receive a refund for slopping thru this `` book . '' hopefully , this review will prevent other people from making the mistake i did . espn should fire this wimpy `` meterosexual '' for writing this book .
when we last left the next generation crew , picard saved data in an errol flynn kind of way against the queen borg . star trek year : <NUM> . we sure are missing the original star trek enterprise crew of kirk , spock , mccoy , etc by now . worf who is now assisting deep space nine boards the enterprise for a visit . picard ( patrick stewart ) certainly has his hands full tonight with an elegant dinner for regent cuzar . laforge ( levar burton ) has an urgent message for picard at the same time and picard is trying to memorize the foreign language for greeting regent cuzar so as not to insult the regent . admiral doughtery ( anthony zerbe ) would like to tell picard that data ( brent spiner ) has been a naughty robot and will not obey starfleet protocol . he is holding the brair patch hostage , which is a population of <NUM> people . ru'afo ( f. murray abraham ) is the son ' a ship captain . he enjoys partaking in a quick facial surgery procedure . ( do n't we all wish we could ) . ru'afo informs picard , data has turned dangerously violent and has done damage to the ship . data must be destroyed . picard has <NUM> hours to save data or picard will terminate the android himself . also in the cast : jonathan frakes , gates mcfadden , marina sirtis , donna murphy , gregg henry , michael horton , mckenzie westmore ( nbc serial , passions ) is credited as a ba'ku villager . does the brair patch have cabbage patch dolls too ? sorry i coud n't resist . easter egg : disc <NUM> special features , click star trek universe , click down to main menu , but do not press . use `` right '' button instead . middle octagon will turn blue . press `` enter '' . tom morello will talk on location about playing `` sona '' . disc <NUM> also includes <NUM> deleted scenes and the alternate ending . one deleted scene includes max grodench playing a trill ensign . he was `` rom '' in star trek : deep space nine tv series ( 1993-1999 ) . the next voyage is star trek : nemesis ( <NUM> ) update : j.j. abrams and damon lindelof ( abc network 's lost ) will produce and direct star trek xi . rumor is it will be a prequel about young james t. kirk in the starfleet academy and about spock . it will be released xmas <NUM> .
i own about <NUM> various concert dvd 's and must say this is about the worst of the lot . the reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable . i ca n't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every <NUM> or <NUM> seconds ( you get <NUM> seconds if your lucky ) but that 's they way they put this together . i actually counted the number of changes over the course of <NUM> minute during the performance of jet and it was <NUM> . <NUM> camera changes in <NUM> seconds of footage - you do the math on that . it 's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent . paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy . in the end it does n't matter as it 's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it
we have a new victim in the vecinity . unwelcome ! title : see above . a small , juicy , masterpiece by jack ford has been cut from the original 1,33:1 format to 1,85:1 . we are left only with the small consolation to deplore it . more : we have been deprieved of the real product for how long ? . shame
it is laughable to read some of these other reviews . but whats not funny is how bad <NUM> cent is . he is the worst rapper of all time a total disgrace to hip hop music . he has no love for the music only for the money . i do n't know how he sells so many records but that just shows how many people do n't know real music
i have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all . i find it grating , and darn near unlistenable . i have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months . miles davis , dave brubeck , kenny burrell , grant green , cannonball adderley , stan getz , chet baker , wes montgomery , bill evans and thelonius monk to name a few . this guy is by far my least favorite . his playing on miles davis cd 's i have and with monk is largely enjoyable and i know he 's a giant . but this stuff ? . the live recording on disc two was so grating i could n't make it through . it sounded to me like a bunch of geese being slaughtered . give me the other guys anytime
i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters . given his status/reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about . having had no preconceptions , i have to say i was quite disappointed . i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable . perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best . specific example that speaks volumes : listen to cohen 's singing of his `` hallelujah '' and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on `` grace '' which was recorded in <NUM> . sorry , leonard , you can not hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song . it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy . `` tant pis , vers le bonheur .
boring ! all this time is spent during the dvd talking about the john fisher technique , but not really showing you anything specific . lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted , all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique ' . who cares ! i did n't order the video so that i could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique , i ordered it so that i could train my own dog . so little instructional information was given and the video was so boring , me and my dogs fell asleep watching it . what a waste
i ca n't stand this movie , it 's one of the worset . the acting is horrible , it 's dark , gloomy , and so boring . it 's fun to watch and make fun of it , but thats about all . i do not recommend it , i would give it zero stars if it was possible . the child actress `` mary '' and then the older grown up `` mary '' actress is n't suitable , she does n't even look like she could have been the same person or type , how awful ! watch another version , this one is a waste of time and money !
few sequels live up to the original , and i consider that the case here . picking up where the first movie left of , the action quickly moves as farmer hoggett falls into a well and hurts himself , the wife fails at farming , so she and babe go to the city to find help . horror is what they find , and babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day . the themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one . whereas the original babe was very lighthearted , with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror , this movie is the opposite . here there are mostly scenes of suspense , with only some lighthearted scenes . the comedy is not that good , but the special effects are a lot better . the overall look of the movie is darker too ; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky , we have concrete , roads , and building walls . this reviewer did not like this movie that much , and was disappointed .
i really do congratulate bill rancic for being hired by one of the richest man in the world . but being hired does not mean that bill rancic just became the next bill gates or warren buffet . great to know that you take yourself very very highly mr.rancic . your going to fit fine in the trump organization , but seriously dont over do yourself . i 'd rather retake my 'x100 intro to business administration ' class in my college than to buy this book
the text is thoroughly unorganized , it has almost no coherent linear progression . the author often repeats himself , uttering the `` final solution '' of the `` jewish question '' over and over without giving an studied analysis of what that means . the book is a pistache of accusations and anecdotes about people 's involvement in the `` final solution '' without offering any studied analysis of any one particular group or person . for example , we are introduced to a commander wohlauf -- an office of battalion <NUM> -- -and his wife . we are told that he killed jews and his pregnant wife watched , but thats about it . the author also infuses his writing with pedantry : rather that presenting the facts as they are , he is compelled to make the reader feel shocked by using exclamation points to drive home how we should feel . undoubtedly antisemitism was endemic not only in germany , but throughout europe , but one gets the feeling that the author is cherry picking throughout history to bolster his outlandish thesis that the germans were predicated to mass murder of jews .
the movie was well filmed . the plot and dialogue while possibly accurate was dull and boring . one of the worst war movies i have seen . i own it but not for long
the only reason i 'm reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today . and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on . so ... no , let 's be fair . i did enjoy analyze this , i really did , though it was n't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life , or even for the rest of the day . and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro ; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie . i did n't have very high expectations , though , because i rarely expect too much of sequels . once again , i was proven right . analyze that illustrates perfectly why ` sequel ' sounds like such a dirty word . the original film had a spark of originality ; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again . but of course , that could never work . it 's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel : those who have n't seen the original would n't understand the jokes , and those who have already heard them before . and that is why they fail time after time . so what does this movie have ? a great comedic duo , a couple of really funny guys . yeah , and ? fathers ' day had an even better pair , look what happened to that . a couple of good mafia jokes ? sure , sure . i even cracked a smile on several occasions . but that is n't enough . there are thousands of comedy films out there ; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable , and producers think they 'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas . newsflash : think again . nobody watches these movies . there 's no reason to when you can just watch the original again
thank god i borrowed this one from the library ! every time i saw a spinning propeller i thought of what my wwii veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes . i could n't even enjoy the battle scenes because of the technical anomalies and anachronisms . it did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped
dr. steven greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of ufology , and he claims to have `` briefed '' senior government figures on the ufo issue , but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously . it 's an amateurish , sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited , free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists , pilots and former government/military figures , most of whom say they experienced a highly strange ufo episode ( though some of the `` testimony '' is second-hand ) . the firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative , especially when they purport to cover the government 's secrecy , suppression and disinformation techniques . but any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that `` disclosure '' is a disorganized , misspelled , contradictory , somrtimes unintelligible , incoherent mess . it 's not even `` written '' in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type , not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker . names and geographic locations are mangled , punctuation is absent , and the speakers ' weird allusions are left hanging . it 's hundreds of pages long , but it feels like the world 's biggest high school social studies project . the one consistent stylistic point is that dr. greer 's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him . it 's a mess . in a foreword greer says the material was/is so urgent , because it deals with the future of the entire human race , etc. , that it had to be rushed into publication . i would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups . tragically disorganized efforts like `` disclosure '' warm the hearts of the disinformation masters , i 'm sure , because the ufo movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status . it 's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage , but `` disclosure , '' for all the nuggets of interest it contains , helps guarantee that the subject wo n't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future .
yea it is great to see <NUM> kickboxer films on the same casette if its only <NUM> and <NUM> , if you wan na see any kickboxer films , get <NUM> and <NUM> , not the worst ones , <NUM> and 4.get <NUM> and
i think we all agree that we would like to be good and moral people and to raise children who are good and moral . i have some problems around coles ' ideas of how to achieve this . he disregards well-researched principles of infant psychology , e.g . that a parent can not really & quot ; spoil & quot ; a newborn baby . nowhere does he refer to the research of people like bowlby , who have found an association between secure attachment between parent and infant , and psychological health of the child
keith sweat 's <NUM> release did n't come off as the usual or other releases of his . for starters , keith is mostly known for his bumping slow jams and he did n't let us down with the ones on here . as a matter of fact , that was the only thing that kept this one from being a total disaster . once getting to track <NUM> with `` i want to love you down '' the lp quickly prepares you for the whining and begging that makes him so popular . it could n't have got any better with `` give me what i want '' featuring silk on background and taking the song to the next level of sexiness . silk and mr . sweat invites you with `` the ten commandments of love '' with the background vocals saying , `` ... come on , come on , come on , come on baby ... '' . maybe this release would have been better if it was an entire keith sweat & silk release
unfortunately , i read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed . hmph . if this is what people think a great recording is , then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse . a few people did mention that the voices might not be the best , but seem to think that this is a small matter . guess what -- the two lead singers are pretty darn bad , and to me it 's a big deal . they are marginal singers , at best . i can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore , and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns . it was actually , quite literally , painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by riding and hayden . every time that we want a musical delivery , we 're cheated of the pay-off . rodgers and hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder , and this particular work deserves passion , feeling and true musical prowess from the performers . this recording sorely lacks these qualities . the only redeeming qualities - the singing of clive rowe as enoch snow and nice conducting in the prologue . otherwise , save your money and - no , do n't save your money - buy another recording like the old one with shirley jones and gordon macrae and listen to some good voices . really . trust me . i have a fine set of musical ears and i know voices
ehhh ... i 'm just not real impressed with this one . first of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice , but also kinda vague . it 's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes , and if you 're interested in astrology at all , you know them already . do n't get me wrong - it 's not * bad . * there 's no wrong information , it 's passably accurate ( for astrology . ) i can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps , and even for the rest of us , it 's occasionally got some new info ( this book , for instance , is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the aries norm . ) it 's just not enough to get excited over , and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done . secondly , and more irritatingly , the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot . i think it would have been easier to deal with if they 'd all just been laughably wrong , but no - after slogging through , say , <NUM> or <NUM> descriptions that could have been describing total strangers ( because they certainly were n't describing me and my people ) , i 'd hit upon something like `` confidential projects , '' which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother . what do you do with a book like that ? ( also ? as has been noted by other reviewers , the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing . if i were to take it seriously , i 'd be huddled in the corner now , wide-eyed , whimpering `` nobody loves me and i have no real friends ! '' sheesh . ) it leads me to one of two conclusions : <NUM> ) it really is scattershot - they 're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks ; or , <NUM> ) they 're actually on to something , but have n't worked out all the kinks yet . which would n't be too bad , except that it 's being published as a finished product , you know ? final recommendation : pass . if you 're reading for entertainment , there are more entertaining astrology books out there ; if you 're a serious student , there are more thorough and accurate books . if you 've got money to burn and do n't mind weeding through the stuff that 's superfluous and the stuff that 's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes , it might make a decent addition to round out a library . just please do n't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology
i recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because i need something to occupy my mind while i scan microfiche at work ( boooorrring ) . i actually have n't finished this book yet , but up until what i listened to tonight , i had n't made my mind up yet on how i felt about it . i was going to see it though , but now i 'm not sure if i will . i do n't even know where to start about what i do n't like about this book . before starting this book , ms. picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings , especially proceedings following such a great span of time . i 'll be the first to admit that i do n't know much about law , but it seems quite unrealistic that delia 's father andrew hopkins ( or should i say charles matthews ? ) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week . i find it hard to believe that on his first day , he would get beaten and practically raped ( i ca n't remember if he was or not ) . i could be wrong , but if <NUM> years have passed , would n't the statute of limitations passed , and even if they had n't , would n't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen ? and would n't it mean something that they were in a different state ? now , even though everyone else seemed to love her , delia was incredibly annoying ( and the actress who read her `` monologues '' in the audio version was equally annoying ) . women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her . i have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men , but rarely ever do . it just seems like a fantasy of picoults , and a very boring one at that . ah , a love triangle , gee , like that 's never been done before . one instance that sticks out is when delia gets upset that eric ( her fiancee and her fathers attorney ) does n't tell her about a court appearing , however , eric did n't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen . but , even the premise for that is questionable : would that really happen ? i mean seriously ! i also hated how the book shifted `` voices '' -- this is not a play , i do n't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective . i did n't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters . i half expected a chapter to be from sophie ( delia 's four year old daughter ) perspective . i could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore . i also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense , and then later incorporated into the passage , also not making sense . for example , eric narrates this dream he had about sondra , who is some beautiful girl he imagined . she turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush . later , ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up . somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit , when really they have no cohesive connection . also , between the three childhood friends ( delia , eric and fitz ) they talk about their memories constantly , as if that is the only thing that binds them together . real friendships do n't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past ... but it does in this book , because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends . to me , it just seems pretentious . what 's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all . one passage i remember is when delia is talking to fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born , and maybe they remember things that never happened to them . i might have that a little wrong , because it 's a bit confusing . it 's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense . it does n't even feel like it 's remotely trying to make sense at all ! the book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual , like picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical . all of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases . delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was four years old . for goodness sakes woman , i have maybe <NUM> or <NUM> memories from when i was four years old or younger , and most of them do n't make sense except for the fact that i know what my parents have told me . by the way she acts , you 'd think she was <NUM> when she was kidnapped . also , she seems to recover memories all the time ... man , i wish i could do that . it just seems a bit implausible , that 's all . the book is saturated in gooey , sappy imagery , metaphors , anecdotes , memories , subplots , and so on . i am not so quick to totally bash an author , but it 's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that i loathe . if i wanted some sappy , melodramatic dimestore paperback i would have read one of those instead . i expected better from the synopsis on the back cover . overall , and i say overall without even finishing the book ( i have n't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet , but it sounds pretty ridiculous ) , that this is definitely one of the most horrible books i 've ever read , bar none . do yourself a favor and skip this one ... and definitely do n't pick up the audiobook . the voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to
no one alive today cares that ny had fires in <NUM> ( unlike the chicago fire of <NUM> ) . why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident . is she trying to create trouble ? be a traitor to her own race ? book is well researched i guess but the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up ! totally unnecessary !
i 've purchased the original pcm encoded cd more than once because i enjoy this album so much . i was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that i still ca n't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc . why would you disable that option ? i guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the cd . the recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content
definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten . adults beware . these guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes . i hope trey and parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons . besides the smugness , i am tired of all the voices in south park sounding all too similar .
rbx is one of my favorite rappers , he has a dark , sinister style . instead of dropping a unique , straight hip hop album ( which is what i was expecting ) . he decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf @ $ # ing family.this is more of a compilation because rbx only does a small handfull of songs solo , and predictably , those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos . so rbx i ask you , why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label , when you could have done a real dope solo album ( how do i miss heatmizer ) and package a compilation of your artists with the album ? i could not be more disappointed . i would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd , sorry x , you wasted your talent on this album , dont be mad at me
the relationships between the various characters were n't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character , lottie , at all . the book seemed to ramble on , and did n't catch my interest . there were a few parts where the action picks up , but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
i had a <NUM> day detention to serve , <NUM> min 's after each school day , so i went to the library originally looking for a book on engenering . i saw this instead , and decided to rent it out . when i got in the car , i noticed the table of content 's had several racial comment 's in the front , but i ignored it . after reading a few ch . i couldnt beleive this book , but i kept reading it , cause it was entertaining how much of an idiot chuck d is . he is the reason some white people have negative veiw 's of black people . because he play 's the role of a loser who blaims everything on the same people that put him where he is now . why not just bite the hand that feed 's you ? if you are in the black panther 's , are obsessed with chuck d , or just straight up hate white people i would suggest this book . the real reason i hate this book is i despise anyone who makes racist comment 's against anyone at any time , and against any race . i myself am white , and there was <NUM> race riot 's where i grew up , i got stabbed in 5th grade by a black kid my age , and my father was murdered before i was born by a black man ... so why do n't i just write a book against `` my oppressor 's `` . this book show 's that chuck d is truely not a smart man , just a racist fool , who is no more smart then flavor flav . he need 's to go back to first grade , and watch more barney , so he can learn to love everyone . but i guess he is just going to get his , ironically like his song `` your gon na get your 's `` . i can not express in word 's how much i hate this book , and i feel ashamed for every buying it takes a nation ..
my mother-in-law bought this soundtrack for my son who is <NUM> years old . we trusted that since this was a disney/pixar movie that the sound track would be appropriate for kids as the movie is geared towards children . however , there is a song on there by chingy ( who i not heard of until we heard this soundtrack ) that is very sexualy suggestive . here is one verse from the song . i like the way you look in them pants , see ya fine ( fine ) lil momma a quarter piece , she far from a dime ( dime ) the type of girl that 'll getcha ' up and go make you grind ( grind ) i 'm thinkin ' about snatchin ' her up , dirty , makin ' her mine look at her hips , ( what ? ) look at her legs , ai n't she stacked ? ( stacked ) i sure would n't mind hittin ' that from the back ( back ) i like it when i touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit jeans saggin ' so i can see her thong a l'il bit i know you grown a little bit , twenty years old , you legal do n't trip off my people , just hop in the regal i swooped on her like an eagle swoopin ' down on its prey i know you popular , but you gon ' be famous today i am appalled that such a song would be on this soundtrack . if your children are older and you do n't mind this kind of music i would recommend this cd as the rest of the songs are really good . however if your children are young and you do n't wish for them to be exposed to this type of song i would strongly not recommend this cd
you almost feel sorry for the author . draped in acclaim , among the books of the year , it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations . more worrying , the author 's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at harvard . and that 's what the book feels like , a very well executed assignment . it 's written in a fairly convincing pidgin english , but when it wavers , it breaks the rhythm and the belief . it also feels entirely formulaic . it goes through the trials of dehumanisation ( murder , rape , sodomy etc ) but it never engages the reader 's sympathy , just occasional admiration . there 's no doubt that iweala can write . i hope he dares to produce something fresh that does n't feel borrowed from another culture , another life . i 'd risk buying another book of his
due to the fact that no one has ever landed on the moon . i saw a movie about this and one of them was `` moon movie '' and its for all to see that we never landed on the friggin moon . so this guy really is getting a good yank here ..
the reason i do n't recommend this book , despite the nice writing and decriptions of the western highlands , is for one dark fact : a number of wild otters died for maxwell 's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet . this is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the western highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in iraq and africa and tries to raise them in scotland . what this story also tells us is that , if you are of a privillaged class , you can have any wild animal you want as your pet . today this is illegal `` pet '' trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction . i know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers ( durrell , heinrich ) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear : wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild
the general feeling i had left after reading through this graphic novel was , that was it ? costing anywhere between <NUM> and <NUM> bucks this title hardly pays for itself . the book overall has a couple of different stories split up , all set in the halo universe . a good way to describe this book is , it 's like the animatrix , short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best , cool and at worst mediocre . the art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but , the shortness of the short stories just left me with again , the feeling of : that 's it ? my suggestion to halo fans out there ? wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it 'll be about <NUM> bucks , then it might be worth buying .
the release of films such as these by fox can do nothing but bury l and h. all of their 40s films are awful and it 's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these . to see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent <NUM> reelers will someday be rereleased . only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why l and h are ranked up there with chaplin , lloyd and keaton . these two warm and wonderful men do n't deserve this - and neither do you .
first off , i 'm into all the emo/screamo/alternative stuff . the used , senses fail , underoath , all of it . but this cd just does n't cut it . it 's not that it 's bad , the songs just arent that interesting . many of the songs just seem to have the same part it . the singer holding a note with the drummer riding on the double-bass pedal with mindless gutiar . of course tha 's nto teh hole song . but each song seems to have that part in it . there a few good songs , like secrets do n't make friends , and a few others . but it 's not worth getting the whole cd . just buy the good ones off of itunes
i recieved this cd as a present , not thinking much about it since its southern rap this cd has almost no lyrical talent the reason i gave it <NUM> stars , is because i enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the neptunes . like almost all southern rap now , its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent . so if your one of those clueless kids that like rap ( mainstream rap ) i would say you could possible enjoy this cd
sorry , but i have to give this dvd a negative review . first of all : what age is it really for ? there are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition . do n't you think it 's a little bit yearly for your <NUM> months old ( and probably even <NUM> ) ? the dvd needs much more real life objects , it sounds and looks very dull and boring . i always thought that children learn through play , songs , rhymes , and etc , but not through dull repetition . even alphabet is introduced without well known `` abc song '' . i am giving this dvd two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my <NUM> months old son ( so far we saw it ones ) . as much more age appropriate material i would recommend : hap palmer `` baby songs : abc,123 , colors & shapes '' ; bee smart baby- vocabulary builder ; baby babble - speech enhancing video ; baby einstein- van gogh ( world of colors ) ; the wiggles- '' toot-toot ''
this is an ok book for new people , but it has several safty issues , and does n't have the show cuts for many dogs , poodles . it also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs . there are better books out there
unlike the first three seasons , which were nothing short of brilliant , this season seems to have lost the wodehouse touch . the absolute low point was a madcap chase up the empire state building ; both bertie and jeeves were completely out of character . i got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately . i highly recommend the first three sets , but if you 're a wodehouse purist , pass on this fiasco
i like gangster movies and am from philly so i gave this movie a chance . what a mistake . the creators painstakingly tried to rip off the sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation . it starts with the horrible theme song . it 's obviously trying to sound similar to the a3 song that serves as the sopranos theme , but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it . the cast is filled mediocre actors , trying in vain to save a stupid script . one funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent , and with the exception of one guy , no one can do a south philly accent . sal mazzotta is trying real hard to be james gandolfini as tony soprano , but i 'm sorry ... he may be a nice guy in real life , but the guy could n't act scared in a graveyard at midnight . and come on ; this guy as a gangster ? maybe as lurch in the adams family . this movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work . i mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking . do n't they teach that in film school ? and usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot , and at completely different angles for close ups , like maybe the close up stuff was done much later . save your money . wish i could get mine back . it 's been a long time since i saw a movie so bad i felt angry and ripped off for having seen it .
this book is awful . i read it , and i could n't wait to finish it . i would have flipped it in the trash can except i had to read it for school . the characters are pathetic , there is no grasp of dialogue , and the author admits that it is the same thing as an f. scott fitzgerald book that was already written . how it became a newberry winner i will never know
i have searched and searched for bill conti 's alternate motion picture score and i have had no luck . does anyone know how to find bill conti 's soundtrack specialist ? eric serra 's score was good but i was disappointed when i purchased it and it was not what i thought i bought . email me at mszacharias @ yahoo.com if anyone has any information on how to find it . thanks
i 'll admit it , the title got me . i probably read two business books a year , and this one did n't offer anything new . most of it was new twists on the same old rules . it was not inspiring , motivating , or compelling
this book has some good information in it , but it is mostly fluff , filler and repetition . each time i sit down to read it , i fall asleep because there is so much filler . the book could easily be reduced to a pamphlet-sized book without any sacrifice of information . i like to know how and why , and i do n't mind reading on and on if the how and why is explained . i even enjoyed the china study , which has a lot of explanatory text to support statements . most people would call the china study a dry read , but every word has a purpose . the miracle of fasting is mostly just empty words with statements only weakly backed up by the author 's personal observations , not science . i think there are some useful tidbits in this book , but i would suggest you borrow this book from a friend or the library if you can . i am hoping to find a more comprehensive book on the subject of fasting . any suggestions
an album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing . obviously , the songs were n't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for . either that or the artist felt they did n't fit right . so how does one go about grading an album of this type ? it 's not easy . graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits , i 'd give this one a single star . marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow , it 's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath . graded as a complementary album to `` illinois , '' however , i 'd give it three stars . i can understand why the songs were n't used and find several of them worth repeated listening . if i could give half stars , this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length . the respective lengths of `` illinois '' and `` michigan '' were n't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks . a compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is
my family and i love anne of green gables and cried through most of it .. we do not have a problem with the first <NUM> ... but ............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen ... i do not know what happen to anne ( megan fellows ) she was dead in every which way you look at it , no sparkal , no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time , she acted like a <NUM> year old women , we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that , and her voice in a few years has become deep and old .. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd ... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast ... hel
she 's built like a 12-year-old boy ... give me vida guerra anyday
`` the best way i know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works , '' says stuart ostrow in his very slim ( <NUM> pages , double spaced with wide margins ) new memoir of his producing career . however he does not define `` dangerous new works . '' from reading the book , it seems his definition of `` dangerous new works '' is whatever is being touted by the village voice . ( richard foreman , homosexuality , multiculturalism , tom eyen , etc . ) stuart ostrow has a story , but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view . the way he sees it , he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail . another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who , after producing big hits with <NUM> and pippin , went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed . his damnation of mel brooks is unjustified since ostrow himself says that he has not seen the producers . well , stu , i have news for you . the producers was a dangerous new work . it was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness . it single-handedly killed the bloated euro musical that had dominated broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous , unpretentious shows like hairspray and the wedding singer . the producers resuscitated the american musical and ostrow missed it . ostrow also badmouths wicked claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle . if that were true , dance of the vampires would still be running . the spectacle of wicked enhances its compelling story , unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring la bete . ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed . evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of michael john lachiusa and jason robert brown , which the public doggedly refuses to embrace . ostrow tells some good anecdotes , but i wish there had been more of them . there 's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in ostrow 's previous memoir ( also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume ) . but at this point , there 's still not a real book between the two of them
if you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading & quot ; she & quot ; , you will be disappointed by this book . leo and party travel to asia to search for ayesha and experience similar , but somehow tiresome , adventures . reread & quot ; she & quot ; instead
this is a required text for a graduate level rf electronics course i am taking . i am very disappointed with this text . there are multiple mistakes and misprints throughout . it seems that the book was proofed by someone who is not familiar with electronic symbology and notation . there are many instances where inconsistant notation will be used within a single example problem ! the author is very short on many subjects and longwinded on others . this book makes for a confusing and frustrating read despite the distinguished ieee brand on the cover . my professor even commented on the sloppyness of the author . i have had to buy additional books to suppliment my studies . this is not a good reference or text book .... coming from someone who has read multiple technical text books ... beware of this one
positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics . however , the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors ' arguments . the more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture . this book is really only useful now for those broad , basic ideas in the first chapters
this movie starts out with an incomplete back-story , <NUM> years before the main story . but , unless someone is well versed in the bible , or the torah , the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment . it jumps to the main story for a few minutes , then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs , but it 's still not clear what is going on . the description says hadassah hid her religion , but it 's not as hidden as you 'd think it would be . over and over again , she and her uncle talk about being jews , the housekeeper calls them jews , their friends call them jews , and there are even more flashbacks to hadassah 's childhood showing how she grew up jewish . she even reads from a scroll of a biblical tale to children in the market . if this is how she hides her religion , i 'd hate to see what she 'd do to flaunt it . actress tiffany dupont tries to give hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world . she 's a teenager longing to explore her roots , and the world at large . this would go well in having teens relate to her , but the dialog gets in the way . the writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the bible . the complex dialog is spewed out , sometimes as quickly as possible , without any real inflection . this causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable . and , unfortunately , even the more seasoned actors stumble over the formalized wording , further distancing the viewer from the story . if you 're really into biblical stories , then maybe you 'd enjoy this , but if you 're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic , it 's best to look elsewhere . ( i could only endure a half-hour .
based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the <NUM> star rating of joe 's playing i picked up the cd/dvd combo ( amazon ) and was , i hate to admit it , dissappointed . granted , he can play and has good chops , but for me , something was missing . maybe that intangible . the fire that comes through the amps . not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view , but for me it was lacking . i need to watch it again to see if i feel the same way . like the a previous two star reviewer , i would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone 's basement and would walked away satisfied . but when you start playing with the big boys , this guy comes up short
i can see the excitement , people get out of a gorefest but this is too much . all taboos have been broken there is nothing left . johnny cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of cash 's songs . he would never have approved of this film . letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste . johnny 's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore
back in the beginning of the extreme music genesis , these guys were one of the pioneers of extreme music . they certainly were n't any of the forms of extreme metal and they certainly were n't punk . unfortunately , they were put into the alternative category which was a catch-all for music that was basically pop while supposedly rejecting the `` mainstream sound '' . that 's right the butthole surfers were stuck in the category that cursed the world with nirvana / nine inch nails / ministry / smashing pumpkins garbage . oh , that reminds me , it cursed the 80s with all those hideous sub-pop label bands . still there were a few `` alternative '' bands that were quite good . only the surfers and big black come to mind though . their live shows were incredible . flashing movie clips flashed strange scenes in the back ground including sex change operation footage . the singer constantly lit his hand on fire for some reason ( as if it were a big dangerous stunt ) , naked women danced on stage , and a certain song they used a huge tuba . their two best albums were hairway to steven and locust abortion technician but some of the earlier ones could be considered as good as these two . there song styles varied from song to song . they would have crazy fast songs such as human cannonball or really slow drugged out songs such as <NUM> going on <NUM> with a depressed radio talk show clip played in the background . they would also utilize oriental sounds modified in their own weird style on the classic kuntz ( spelling ) . we also got the weird rantings on `` johnny smokes '' who was a `` crippled midget lesbian boy who stood ten foot tall with a knife ! '' well , they got to be pretty popular and appeared on the alternative music fest tour lollapalooza and soon after actually got signed to a major label . the last i heard probably over <NUM> years old was some songs off of the major label release `` independent worm saloon '' . they had seriously sold out their style degenerating in a more acceptable mainstream sound . i had n't paid attention for these many years but recently checked out this weird revolution . this has got to be one of the most extreme sell-out jobs ever . i ca n't think of a worse bit of conforming to please mainstream record labels hoping for success . i have seen plenty and most of them quite bad but i honestly ca n't think of any that tops this . this is the kind of pumping technopop you see in bad movies . what happened ? i am not aware of how popular these guys have become or not but it is one of the saddest falls of a great band i have ever known
most off the scientific facts are wrong . the earth 's center is as big as mars ! ! ! ! ! ! come on ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe as big as moon . under the earth 's ground is liquid magma . its liquid because off the pressure , and its not possible to under it . the producers obviously forget about food supplies , and oxygen . the only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air . i think that this is the only realistic thing
no , it 's certainly not as good as the first one , but i did enjoy some of demons <NUM> . the beginning is cool enough , with the demon 's resurrection and it 's gaining access into sally 's apartment via the tv set . the tension and dread seem to build quite nicely . that is , right up to the scene where the kid-demon 's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic , rubber demon puppet ! ugg ! it reminded me of those stupid monsters in ghoulies , hobgoblin , or some other wretched '80s mess ! the apartment building setting was interesting , but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few , precious bursts of action we actually get . i did like the weightlifter folks in the gym . they were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders ! the battle in the parking garage was ok too . maybe i just expected d2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing ...
technicaly this is an excellent performance , however the choice of selections is doleful and does not bring much christmas cheer to the listener . the earlier cd releases by chanticlier were wonderful but this one misses the mark
overall this book was ok . nothing special about it . i am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed . i would like the author to please show me where a person can get <NUM> million dollars worth of insurance for $ 250- $ <NUM> as the book states . most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for <NUM> years . the author left out a lot of information and i would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business . the only thing decent in the book is the appendix , but even that is not detailed enough . i give it two stars for effort and because i am a nice person
first of all , this album mirrors bright eyes in so many ways , it 's almost ridiculous . he sings about photographs , nbc , drinking . bright eyes song old soul song is all about developing a photograph . let 's not sh * * ourselves has conor yelling about nbc , abc , and cbs ( two of which an angle has in change the world ) and bright eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs . also , kris has mastered the bright eyes singing style . this is not a negative thing , it 's just very similar . but as for the album itself , minding the bright eyes comparision , it is about <NUM> miles away from a masterpiece . that being said , at least it 's on the road to a masterpiece , albeit far far away . songs like true love and a way with words are fantastic and shine on the album . songs like white horses and green water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else kris has to offer . but too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking `` when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk ? '' songs like born in a bottle and angry drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring . going back to bright eyes , the only reason that songs like the big picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant . kris does n't have this lyrical ability yet . however , i am excited about the future of an angle . i think in the next coming years if kris can mature a little , both musically and lyrically , he 'll make an album that 's brilliant . an album like bright eyes ' `` i 'm wide awake it 's morning '' ( which i believe is his best ) . maybe he should just lay off the drinking .
these days , it seems like you hve to try to be a reality star inorder to make it big . for a celebutant like paris hilton , she does n't really deliver as a solid an soulful singer . that is very unfortunately big shame . her second single , nothing in this world , is n't a very good song from a wannabe pop star . the song like stars are blind , is just as bad . i am not very convinced at all . she sounds like she is trying to had to really deliver like britney spears , jennifer lopez and kelly clarkson . to actually be honest with you , i 'd rather listen to michael jackson instead of this . paris is not aything in this world , and this song is just the shameful same . song : f
very pretty but a limited number of arms and my family was not even in the book . for such an expensive work , i expected my family to be there
the item you sent me was not the right item . i think ? then you sent me the same item back to me. ? did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on reissue and remaster . i could have already purchased this item , reissue , at the store down the street for less the amount that i spent at amazon . sorry not a satisfied customer
this book was a bit typical for my liking . the setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters , all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school . through this story jeremy , our lead man , experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter . and what are these things ? why smoking , drinking , partying and sex of course ! all told through immature eyes , making this book one which i did not enjoy very much ..
before embarking on a <NUM> month trip to italy a friend let me borrow rick steve 's guide and said that it was better . i was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip . she was right . rick steve 's organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way . this comes in handy when you 're standing in a busy square , you have n't eaten all day and everything you 've tried so far has been a jip and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal . flipping through lonely planet you might think you 've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - overloaded with information poorly organized . rick steve 's book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or , to put it more tritely , a helping hand . not to mention that his guides have a personal touch and some of rick steve 's own character sewn into them . after some time you really get the sense that he 's there with you , helping you along ( - now is n't that sweet ! ) .
this sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential nuggets collections -- nuggets : original artyfacts from the first psychedelic era , 1965-1968 ; or nuggets ii : original artyfacts from the british empire and beyond . those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as harry smith 's folk collection . not so here . i counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent , but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties ? not much
i didnt really enjoy this book that much i thought it could have been bette
why do you think leary does n't do live shows anymore ? hicks is n't around for him to steal material from ! and that is precisely what leary did . he took bill 's material , excised anything controversial and intelligent ( as in all of bill 's political work ) , added more profanity to attract the ignorant , and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material , rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator
as a fan of world war <NUM> movies especially those made during the period 39/45 i must say that i thought the people who had this example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . i am all for old movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have found a better copy to sell , it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . dvd is supposed to be reasonable quality , this example is disgusting . to have the nerve to offer it for sale is unbeleivable
i find it disturbing that john updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book ... beyond one artist who is practically unknown . and she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her . updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor . he does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist georgia o'keefe , but no actual artwork created by o'keeffe . that should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like . disturbing , too , are updike 's dismissive comments about edward hopper ; he claims that edward hopper ca n't paint faces very well . so even though i purchased this book , i do n't recommend it to others . give this one a pass .
save your money and buy something else . the dylan performances are few and uninspired . the rest -- peformances of dylan -- are sometimes good , sometimes amusing , sometimes odd , but do n't amount to much as a collection . i wanted to see the movie until i heard the soundtrack
i purhcased this book because i am intersted in world religions , especially those with elements of mysticism . i have often heard references to the kabbalah and i wanted to learn more about its contents . i am a college student majoring in biology , psychology , and history , and my desire to study the kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest . if i were pursuing a degree in religious studies , or had i been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that scholem discussed , i would have been fine . however , it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by scholem . there is simply too much jargon and scholem 's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance . if you are an experienced religious scholar , most likely this book will be excellent . however , if you 're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of jewish mysticism , this book will only frustrate you because it 's too advanced
yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro . her husband monsoro is not getting any , how would you feel . this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson , do n't buy books you do n't know , cause they [ are bad
i am originally from the land of ten thousand lakes myself ( and there 's a hell of a lot more than ten thousand lakes , by the way ) . i am also a musician , singer , and writer of a `` country roots '' perspective ( who now lives <NUM> min . outside nyc ) , who understands how crappy the business can be . my biggest complaint about rockie , my fellow minnesotan , is simply this : he and his music do n't sound like they come from minnesota , nor carolina ( his birthplace , am i correct ? ) , and lotsa ' good country music comes from these two regions . i mean , this record is produced well and sounds generally good , but he sounds like someone who is taking the advice of all the jackasses from nashville who say , `` ya ' got ta ' sound like this and look like this ; 'cause that 's what works down here , plain and simple ! '' well , i think that theory is gon na ' die sooner than later . you gots guys like djerks bently and eric church who are still not exactly where country needs to be , but they are making a slight dent in the `` soccer-momming '' of country music . wan na ' hear good country music ? check out <NUM> city run ! they are what cmt should be airing , and they are getting airplay on `` wide open country '' ( seriously , check out this band , and my review of them -- <NUM> city run -- for they 're the real frickin ' deal ) . so rockie , my friendly advice would be this : drop the affected , mainstream , country radio accent ( do n't replace it with a hard-core minnesota accent , however -- fargoooo -- no good ) , get a band that plays more than one kind of country music , and draw on the great history of music that has come from minnesota ( jayhawks , replacements , even marvin rainwater , oh , and that bob dylan-dude ) and carolina ( too many influences to even start ! ) 'cause that 's you , man ! that 's where you 're from ! that 's how you 'll sound genuine ( as the one reviewer noticed how at times you seemed to be trying too hard , other times , not hard enough ) ! my theory : your hearts not in it ! you have tremendous talent and i 'm pulling for you , the next album , and the vikings -- the last , more reluctantly each year . god speed , bryan sw connecticut
reading some reviews and the blurbs for this book one could be forgiven for thinking that mcgrath has dealt a crushing blow to dawkins . far from it . what we actually have is a christian theologian basically answering dawkins with 'not in my religion . ' it is a defense of his own personal christian beliefs and there is virtually no mention of other religions nor recognition of differences within christianity itself . mcgrath makes an argument that we can only be agnostic yet only applies this to atheists and clearly not to himself and other christians . he does not say what he believes about the many other gods and spirits etc humans believe or believed in though it is only possible to conclude that he must be an atheist where they are concerned . there is a valid point he makes about the correlation between religious belief and health and well-being but this does not mean that religious belief is the cause of the health . if religious belief caused good health and well-being then , as the vast majority of people who have ever lived have had one religious belief or another , we would expect the world have always been overflowing with health etc . this is obvously not the case . the only evidence offered for god is how nature makes us feel - nature being the pointer towards the beauty of god . he conveniently avoids telling us what parasites , diseases , predation , tsunamis etc etc tell us about god . mcgrath says that the question of god 's existence is not a scientific question . 'it 's more like the question of whether democracy is better than totalitarianism . ' precisely ! religions are the products of ( almost exclusively ) male minds . they are linked to self-interested tribal identity both to bond and identify 'us ' and distinguish us from 'them ' . and this is where dawkins is lost on mcgrath - dawkins ' writings undermine the very foundations for divisions and hierarchies not only of humans but of all life . dawkins ' frustration no doubt partly comes from the fact that evolved human tribalism is as ingrained as it so unfortunately is . mcgrath himself knows and says that religious belief is about identity and status . finally , mcgrath never touches on the most obvious point of religion - the promise of immortality . if this is not self-interested narcissism , a need to believe oneself so special that one can not die and will reap great rewards in heaven , then i do n't know what is . the dangers involved in this thinking are not addressed . if mcgrath truly believes we can all only be agnostic then he should be trying to persuade his fellow believers and not just atheists . if religious people worldwide adopted agnosticism it may dampen the flames of divisive , tribal religious fervor and increase general humility to everyone 's benefit . in the meantime i 'm looking forward to reading dawkins ' 'the god delusion '
i purchased this and was not happy . this show was most certainly influential for the better and latter show , but by no means has the depth and excellent dialogue of `` as time goes by ''
please change your name to ( kid rap ) .. when you start producing true rock cd 's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name ... stop playing both sides .. i realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about .. do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music . one day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away ..
in <NUM> , morgan heritage released miracle , its lackluster debut lp , and followed it three years later with the superb protect us jah . since then , the band has established a reputation for melodious , but uninspired , crossover albums that seem only to appeal to listeners with a casual interest in reggae music . for a band that began its career with glaringly mediocre music , coming `` full circle '' is nothing to celebrate . in this latest offering , the band reasserts their formula of `` safe '' pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in the north american and british markets . like previous albums , full circle meanders from r & b ( `` enough is enough '' ; `` your best friend '' ) to watered-down roots ( `` propoganda '' ; `` so much to come '' ) , with a handful of dancehall tracks bolstered by guest appearances . between the electric guitar riffs and the appearance of bounty killer on the final cut , it 's obvious that the producers are trying desperately to reach the broadest possible audience . as rastafari reggae artists , morgan heritage 's generic message and nonprovocative image stands in stark contrast to the raw energy and fervor of such contemporaries as lutan fyah and capleton . sadly , both full circle and heritage 's recent live performances stand as further evidence that the band is n't interested in producing anything other than slick , commercial , feel-good jah music . this is unfortunate , because the morgans are talented vocalists . most tragic of all , however , is that the only time heritage is provocative is when they 're preaching intolerance toward christians and homosexuals in their lyrics and concert interludes . despite its stylistic and lyrical inconsistency , the album is not without its strong points ; highlights include the catchy , uptempo `` hail up the lion '' and the dancehall remix of `` u 've got me '' . even so , there is n't nearly enough substance here to keep you interested long , even if you happen to love the album initially . expect copies of full circle to accumulate in used record stores over the next six months
i did n't buy the cd ... i could n't make it past the samples . i loved constantine on idol . i did n't think he was the best there , but i thought he was near the top . performance wise though , this guy can perform on stage ... i just love him . this music though , not impressed . i understand why he would want to promote his original band , but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own . he did so good on idol and had so many fans . granted , i 'm sure some will buy this cd just because they are a fan . and i 'm sure that there are some that will love it . i 'm not one of them though . i really wanted to like it , but i just ca n't . that said though , i would really like to see the constantine from idol make his own cd . now that one i would buy
my biggest complaint is willis 's assumptions about the reader . she assumes every reader is deeply and fundamentally flawed , with money only exacerbating existing conditions . people that are relatively level-headed and well-adjusted will find little in this book about the trouble money can bring . they will , however , find out how money affects those that already have psychological issues . the book should not be used as a predictor of the problems that come with money . moreover , she also assumes that the reader is well-versed in christian values and are open to christian citations , further narrowing readability . in chapters where a case-file would be helpful , willis instead harkens to biblical texts and the parables of jesus to validate her insights . for interest 's sake , willis also highlights mostly stories of the extreme , case-files that seem to relate to only few people . occasionally , an example will be aptly targeted toward most of the audience , but most of the time , the cases apply to people that have inherited many millions or posses standing , major psychological issues . furthermore , the lessons that the author distills from her case files are rather ambiguous and broad . it is a somewhat veiled example of `` fortune cookie '' therapy . in the key moments where willis could show the reader how to learn from the extreme cases , the author resorts to a very unspecific retelling of the case-file , with little insight about how to improve . the book might have been substantially stronger given more real-life examples with deft analyses . in addition , the book has an overall patronizing nature that needs to be addressed . the author , someone that has seen so many problems afflicting inheritors , has the chance to truly help without adding too many personal feelings but instead insists on injecting an air of moral superiority . i picked up the book as a complete novice in the world of inheritance and its ramifications . unfortunately , i remain as such , due to the handbook 's narrow aim and arrogant nature
paul what were you thinking ? you do so good on mixtapes lyricly and on get ya mind correct but on this no effort ! ok first im a playa taken from still tippin , internet goiong nutz from still tippin all with corny flows repeatative terms but some songs were good sittin sideways was already rammed into my head like a year before it came out so what does that leave you with ? surp sippin bugz bunny ? what ? chick magnet or how to be a player should have been re released instead of this cd ! big ballin was pretty good but still the cd is just not worth listenen to buy the paul wall mixtape its got all the good songs and more the mixtape is way better trust me ! he needs some new flows ! fo real ! oh yeah this tracklist aint right atleast with the cd i got .
i do n't know what walmart these girls came from , but the ones i 've been to only seem to staff homely , short , fat , goblin-like women . i smell a deception here . there 's absolutely no way in h * ll that girls which look like this would have such a job . you 'd find them working at espresso booths or something , where all the babes seem to be . i think in this case playboy is appealing to our `` fantasies '' of seeing `` regular girls from walmart-type jobs '' naked , but they could n't possibly have found such quality at one of the actual stores .
i feel skeptical about nin singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the usa . the singles just have n't been as good . the only good thing about this single is the live at rehearsals version of love is not enough . it has a raw and rough feeling that i appreciate from the now too over-produced nin . the dfa remix of thtf is too long - drawn out and redundant ... like a bad techno song . buy this if you collect halos ( like i do ) ... but if you 're looking for a great single with great remixes ... look for the promo 12inches instead .
i want to change the world sounds noble enough but with the fluff in between these covers , this & quot ; world changer & quot ; has some time , if ever , to go until he can lay any claim to this . karims fellow designers should be outraged by his presentation of their industry as being so fickle , tranparent and thin . a real shame given the power that products have in our lives and to our cultures . do not buy this book
what is up with this director desire to do overlapping and panning camera shots ? i mean if you going to use it a few times , as pointless as it is ... no problem but for every scene ? c'mon now ... aint we getting a little carried away here . i was dizzy after the first <NUM> minutes and still manage to watch the whole movie which is a feat that i challenge anyone here to take . you would most likely turn the movie off within <NUM> minutes and burst out profanities in the process . the only reason i watch the whole thing not because i wanted to know about this sick killer 's multiple personality defense interview but the person who was giving the interview , the ultra hot brittany daniel . we went gaga over her role as the devious temptress in dawson 's creek but as a <NUM> 's chick doing the interview .... omg ! it almost seems like she was enjoying the fantasy about this guy based on her expression and body movements . she was dress to kill with that <NUM> 's disco outfit . the movie scenes was accurate to the times which is a plus . still it was a badly directed movie with horried camera work and the dialog was bad too ( accurate or not ) that even the lovely brittany cannnot save . not recommended even if your a fan of the hillside strangler . and if you are ... seek help !
i will always give shelia e.madd props for her musical talent but this album does n't do it for me all the way.soft vibe & missing some snap.there are hints of funk here & there but overall nothing really cooks to me.she does her best work overall for others & live to me.but this is another mild album which hardly to me showcases her full musicial depth
boy , was this a disappointment . the curmudgeon was a big fan of the first movie , a clever parody of bond movies , but it seems the ol ' creative and comic barrel had ran empty this time around . god knows what drivel they put out for the third film - i was not tempted to see that . so what 's the problem ( s ) ? well , for one - austin powers . he 's just not funny in this , in fact he 's just downright annoying . once the scenes begin to go on you realise just how much of a 2-d character he really is . no-one expects a fully realised emotional character , but a little range and depth would work wonders . you can actually see myers struggling as the movie continues . we 'll pass by the unfunny names which were covered in the opening review , and talk about dr evil . the best character in the first ( and still in this ) has also been spoiled - maybe it 's too much of him or .. i dunno . oh , wait - yes i do . they have him rap . nice one mike - let 's make a character do something he would never do for the sake of a cheap laugh . yeah , it 's a comedy , but even characters should have limits and contexts , and dr evil was just ruined after that . mini-me is a failure , his only contributions are giving the finger to people . oh , my sides . plus , when you add in fat bastard , a tedious `` baby-eater '' with myers horrific attempt at a scottish accent , you are n't so much rolling in the aisles as charging up them towards the exit . this movie would probably have scored two stars , but i 'm deducting another for all the idiots who thought it original and amusing to say `` grooooooovy baby '' etc and think they were the king of comedy . hey , my reviews my rules
sometimes brainless action movies can be at least entertaining , but this movie does not deliver . i could n't even finish watching it on cable . really idiotic ! and this from the same director who made `` man on fire ! ? !
i have been reading cornwell for about a decade now and in the <NUM> 's i thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there . her first <NUM> or <NUM> novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - trace - represents an all-time low . the thing that got me was the level of the writing , it just seemed so flat and lifeless . i found it repetitive in the first chapter when scarpetta is saying to herself that `` she should have been told .... '' . it just seemed so ordinary , almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like cornwell .
a lot of talking , not much doing . the teacher is annoying ! ! please save your money , all the other reviews must have been written by her
i did not like this book very much . the author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic american microscope . it is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates `` survive '' in ksa and not a true representation of the nation or its people . it is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary . it fully conforms to the biased view of muslim nations presented in the western media . i know many saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book . to the contrary , they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people i have come accross . if you want the `` fox news '' version of saudi , by all means read this book
i odered this book a long time ago from one of the used book dealers
the movie is not good but a lot can be learned by watching it through , even though it drags . the 1950s 'babe ' played by jayne is a period piece , but having lived in las vegas for the past five years , i can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city . the film is about a certain niche , created by men and probably by religion too , and into this niche women step and become stigmatized . the whore or babe is like the witch in the medieval period - something demonic and devilish . i assure you , the values in the film are not out-of-date . the movie also is an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism - espec . italian and the nyc area . and you see in this a connection to las vegas too . the film , if it teaches anything , teaches us that we are far less emancipated , liberated , rational , liberal , etc . in regard to sex and to women than we thought we were . again the parallel to witchcraft is a good one : naive liberals thought the witch-hunting was over in the early 1700s . in fact , witches were burned in all major european ocuntries into the late 1700s . and 1950s babes a la mansfield are not only the adult identity of many , especially in las vegas , in the year <NUM> , but are probably the role-models of <NUM> and <NUM> year olds . ...
ok , first off everyone knows this is a great movie , but considering how many times it has been re-packaged for dvd over the last <NUM> years , you know they will be doing the ol ' double dip trick again now that it 's come to blu-ray . this is the first ( blu-ray ) release and , yes , a great price from amazon for sure . i 'd wait for the unrated extended ( 152min ) cut that 's available now for cheap on dvd . be warned if u buy this one , more versions will come
this book is highly overrated . i am sure i will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing . i enjoy joyce , and many avant garde writers . stein has an ego as big as a house . witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the autobiography of alice b. toklas . the literary equivalent of picasso she is not . the book is slow and boring , filled with failed , in my opinion , rhetorical tricks . if you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers , joyce being the best . jack kerouac is a newer author who is great also . i found it difficult to finish this book . it did not keep my attention . i basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent . it would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius .
this film is so stupid that when different locations in quebec are shown the captions read `` st. jovite , canada '' or montreal , canada '' like mentioning quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for . angelina jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately . but i will say that i am happy that she went to see an expos game while in montreal ... and that she shows us some skin here . the kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is so annoying ! ! ! someone needs to steal his john lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film . one bonus in here is that marie-jose croze is in it albeit briefly . she should have been the lead . she 's hotter than angelina and a better actress ( see munich ) . this film is also beneath jean-hugues anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun ethan hawke any day of the week
this may be a good movie . however , i ca n't tell because the dvd they sent me was a `` region <NUM> '' version that wo n't play on u.s. dvd players -- or at least not on mine . if you buy this , be sure you 're getting something that will work on your equipment . otherwise , like me , you 've wasted your money
a mouse looses his family members & then finds them . it 's just an ok book , very underserving of all the 5-star reviews . a better mouse book would be- if you give a mouse a cookie .
the premise here is so engaging that i 'm not surprised the author got it published , but basically , it 's such a self-indulgent ramble that it 's not worth the time of people other than the author . how can a person make the topic of james bond and his 'disturbing world ' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first <NUM> pages ? if you 'd like to know , read the first hundred pages of this book . like many , i came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read . we 're talking about james bond here after all . the author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously , and that 's fine , but in that case , we should n't have to be bored . i would strongly recommend not reading this book . it could have been covered in a long magazine article or , as i said , as the occasional comment on a blog about james bond
trash ... trash ... trash .. the worst recording he has ever done .. it would have been better if he recorded it with the uganda symphony orchester . i wasted my money on this piecs of junk . and if possoble i 'd like you to send this review directly to him
i was tremendously disappointed in this book . the cost of $ 35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author . all you need to do is refer to pages 227-246 . those are the pages that represent the bibliography . i actually was so pissed off after reading this book that i counted them . in total the author referenced the words and work of <NUM> author people . there are only <NUM> pages of text and <NUM> chapters in the book . i am certain you can do the math but i 'll do it for you . there are on average more than <NUM> references per page and over <NUM> per chapter . it 's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own . if i wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people i would have done that . i was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process . instead , what i got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework . my only question is who is less ethical : the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process . for all of those that gave this book <NUM> stars i can only guess that you do n't enjoy actually reading
as mentioned in another review , stolen scenes from runaway train . not just clips , but entire scenes . also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger . still worth $ <NUM> - $ <NUM> for a dvd just for the other action
there are more than <NUM> popular chart pattern . i returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites . i do not want to publicize any website . but do a search in google for 'stock chart or technical indicator ' and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book . i can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy . the golden rule ... if the system works then may be start a hedge fund .. if it does not then write a book ... hold seminar ...
i think all the songs sound the same and like she is trying to sound like avril .
when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue , you may as well turn it off . the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume . not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm . a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash
i recently read the thirty years ' war 1618-1648 , hoping to gain some insight into the holy roman empire by reading about one of its turning points . well , i was left rather disappointed . a short book , it does little to set the scene -- clearer explanations of the structure of the empire would have been good , as i was left very much in the dark as to who electors were , and what the political structure of the empire was , and what the rules of succession were , for instance . maps were the most part absent as well , and they would have been very helpful to trace the course of the war , the movement of troops , etc . the thirty years ' war is a civil war in the empire , in which foreign powers intervened , and warred with each other as well ... yet the explanations of what these foreign powers did against each other outside of the empire is somewhat lacking . so , i 'm still left scratching my head as to the structure of the holy roman empire , to some extent . the book did not fulfill the role i had hoped it to play . it certainly did explain to some extent the consequences of the war to the empire , so i did learn something , but not as much as i 'd hoped . i would advise caution before picking this book up
. . . of about <NUM> minutes i 'll never get back . the movie is <NUM> minutes , but around minute <NUM> i decided i was so bored and did n't care what happened . like another review , i agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive . not quirky or interesting . they 're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that . and did i mention it was boring ? so mind numbingly boring . there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what i assume this movie was attempting . i ca n't be bothered to think of examples , because i 'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this
in the <NUM> 's there was american british and canadian rock . its a shame that most living outside of canada did n't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the canadian product . my biggest beef with all of the april wine `` greatest hits '' compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored . who put these compilations together ? where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist myles goodwyn during all of this ? where is `` fast train , bad side of the moon , drop your guns , electric jewels , weeping widow , just like that , you could have been a lady , anything you want , victim for your love , forever for now , cat 's claw , come on along , the band has just begun '' etc etc etc ? the albums `` electric jewels , on record and stand back '' as well as `` live at the el mocambo '' are much more representative of april wine . canada rocked , we really did . you just would n't know it from this pap .
i love patti , and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date . this one is not good at all . this a low point in patti 's career , and god knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk . live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what i can see on tv . i really wanted to like this , but `` ai n't no way '' this song should have been remade by patti and mary who has a pitch issue . if you can not do a song justice , do n't sing it ! ! ! ! ! patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers , but singing high notes do n't `` make '' a song , interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics . patti and mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register . patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one . this cd came and went , period ! i literally gave it away ! ! ! ! !
i thought the music was dull , the lyrics uninteresting . the only song that made me want to listen to twice was the daisy prince piece . the liza minelli song was painful
... or , how to make a quick buck on someone elses stuff . or , to summarize with a trite phrase , & quot ; ca n't beat the real thing & quot ; . the legendary guaraldi wrote jazz that is akin to american culture , and is loved by all . this translation takes something that was perfect and takes it down the other side of the peak . is n't it enough to enjoy the original works without embellishing it with some popular anecdotes ? would you buy steely dan from anyone but fagen ? it just misses the mark , and screws up a good thing
when you receive this set , they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf , for an additional $ 2.98 . what arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder . 20th century fox entertainment should be boycotted . they make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely <NUM> cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs . i love the simpsons , but i am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case
although this dvd says it 's `` digitally remastered , '' that only means that it was transferred from film to the digital medium of dvd . the releasing company missed a golden opportunity to clean it up -- the film is grainy , flickering and shows signs of deterioration that could and should have been corrected before releasing the film on dvd . the soundtrack , as well , is perfectly awful , with shattered , screeching highs and inaudible lows . i have recordings made from wax cylinders recorded before <NUM> that have been restored to sound much better than this <NUM> release . it 's very discouraging that so little care and attention should have been paid to finally making this film available after so many years . anna may wong , and the people who buy this dvd , deserve better
turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose , months after i gave up on it . i have a door that rattles if it 's not wedged open and t-o-c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own . i struggled , oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters . i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken . i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier . i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all do n't need a subject , a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three . i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it . i offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car . i considered lighting the fire with it . i wondered whether , if i took just a few pages a day , i could eat it and get rid of the evidence . i offered it to my mother-in-law for christmas . i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt . and then , eventually , voila ! the rattling door ! what a fine tome t-o-c is . another few hundred pages [ ... ] and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic
ya know , when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was more suprised that <NUM> cent was actually familiar with a group as great as mobb deep . i did n't even think <NUM> knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york . i mean i know <NUM> 's from nyc but think about it .... new york is one of the top <NUM> most populated cities in the world . n-e-wayz .... yo this cd is definately different from their earlier works on `` hell on earth '' and `` the infamous '' albums . but just because it 's different does n't mean that i 'm impressed . obviously , mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they 've given up by signing with <NUM> to make more money . i mean .... it 's all on their titles on the list of songs . does this all mean that their sellouts ? well .... considering i 'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music ... i 'm really not sure . every artist/groups have different intentions . i mean ... with a group as big as this ... maybe theres a motive to their madness ? ? ? i 'm trying to look at this from different points of views . mobb deep has been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they are considered veterans of this game . doing it since what ... <NUM> right ? ? i honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners . i think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the hell on earth album . we may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from g-unit . but hey , i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to <NUM> , i dunno . nonetheless .... compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage . i agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like <NUM> . i suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this cd instead of buying the whole thing . there are no more than <NUM> good songs on this album . oh yeah and the album gets better at the end . too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles . peace
i wish amazon allowed giving `` zero '' stars to an album . i bought my first john & yoko album in <NUM> ( `` life with the lions . '' ) i got `` ripped off , '' although i should have know better .. i was smart enough not to buy `` two virgins '' because of the bad reviews . i bought `` life with the lions '' without reading any reviews , but i was young , naive , and a big lennon fan . oh well ! the john & yoko albums released before the breakup of the beatles were all pretty much the same . the chief instigator of these albums seems to be yoko . her background in the `` avant garde '' and `` conceptual art '' is apparent in these albums . the basic premise is : take a `` concept '' and run with it . keep running with it for as long as possible . let 's hear john & yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour . let 's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate . after all , the big joke is that john lennon 's name is on this album ... so even if the `` concepts '' are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will buy this piece of vinyl because a beatle has his name on the cover ! ! ! `` the wedding album '' was the biggest rip-off i ever experienced as a beatles fan and purchaser of all things beatle . when this album came out in <NUM> it was priced higher than a regular album because it was a big box ! the graphics for this product had to cost more than the recording costs . the recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish . feel like hearing john & yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour ? feel like hearing `` home audio '' of every inane bit of their `` bed-in for peace ? '' i sometimes think the most `` conceptual '' thing john & yoko could 've done with this project would have been giving the customer an empty box ! it probably would 've sounded better . buying the cd version of `` the wedding album '' seems bizarre . the product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the cd format . the only blessing in the cd version is the inclusion of three actual songs . however , the three actual songs are yoko 's . so maybe it 's not that big a blessing after all . all three tunes were b-sides to plastic ono band singles . i do n't recommend buying any of john & yoko 's `` conceptual '' albums . do yourself a favor and make one of your own ! !
now i love the clash as much as anyone else , but this dvd is n't really needed . they made some of the greatest records of all time , but they never really made great videos . more interviews and live performances would have been nice , and the inclusion of the late , great joe strummer 's short film is a welcome addition , but i would recommend that you just buy the studio albums over this dvd & gt
as an avid agatha christie fan , i was thrilled to receive this movie as a gift for my birthday . i had watched the two other movies staring peter ustinov as hercule poirot and absolutely loved them ! ! however , i was so bored and frustrated throughout this movie . albert finney was a terrible poirot . i honestly could barely understand a word he and some of the other actors were saying . the accents were barely comprehendable . i had to play and replay the end where the mystery is solved . i am very upset my husband spent the money on buying this movie as i am sure that i will never be able to sit through it again . the plot was great , however , some of the acting was horrid . i am only giving it two stars because it is based on an agatha christie novel . based on the film itself ; no stars . if you can understand even half of what albert finney is saying , you 're a better woman than i
i 've read lots of pregnancy books , and this book came recommended as an `` honest '' view . it may be honest , but very negative ! i realize that motherhood is n't usually the fairytale many of us hope it will be , but this book just dwelled on the negatives : sometimes you ca n't figure out breastfeeding , sometimes you worry that your husband might leave you , sometimes the baby wo n't stop crying .... hopefully there are more books out there that are more evenly balanced with `` real life '' stories . i recommend that you keep looking
