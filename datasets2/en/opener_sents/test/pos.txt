i 've been a big fan of jean luc ponty and stanley clarke for years . i 've owned the `` rite of strings '' cd for a couple of years and find it quite unique and enjoyable . the music is very complex both in composition and execution . that is , you wonder how <NUM> guys can produce all this complex sound . i recently purchased this dvd and have watched it with great delight several times . seeing the music performed is quite illuminating . i have a new , great appreaciation for al dimeola ! for all you guitarists , this is a must-see performance ! his ovation guitar has the most beautiful , clear , bright sound and his playing is unbelievable . the sound quality of the dvd is fantastic and the camera work contributes significantly . in fact , i would rate the camera work on this dvd at the top of my list . you are treated to up close fingerwork as well as shots showing the interplay between the performers . this performance dvd will blow you away
all women have their problems , but for bridget jones , with her seemingly permanent single life , for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about , her habit of drinking a little too much , and her trouble with her weight , which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down , the poor thing just ca n't seem to catch a break . an instantly lovable character , bridget is real , and her complaints about life and men are often hilarious and believable . her conversations with her friends are also extremely enjoyable as they dish and grumble about all the things that men do wrong , which , you know , are quite a lot . often her musings and thoughts , the `` what 's wrong with me , '' and her compulsively-fixated dieting and attempts at positive reinforcement , are very entertaining . very funny book that is different in several ways from the movie ; so if you have seen the movie , try the book ( books ) .
this book is a must read . you will learn lots of things from making your own facial mask from natural ingredients from your kitchen and how to take care of your body inside and out . i 'm glad i bought this book . & quot ; highly recommended you should try and read it & quot ; ! nothing to loose but bad skin ! !
it is true that this is a great collection of songs . with that said , here are two complaints : <NUM> ) the audio snippets from the movie are built into the tracks , so they 're tougher to skip through . <NUM> ) the audio transfer is terrible . somewhere in the process , either at the transfer or the mix , the audio thinned out . there 's a really weak bass end , and everything sounds thin and tinny . not that it ruins the experience , but for someone who 's actually into how music sounds , you might look elsewhere
my daughter is three months old and has been discovering/watching these dvd 's since she was two weeks old . i did n't think she would pay any attention to them but she loves them ! she sit 's in her bouncy seat and we watch them together . she coos and smiles at all of the animals and kicks her feet to the music . well worth the money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

joan druett adds her name to the growing list of authors who have , in the last few years , tackled the topic of seafaring misadventure . we have had several excellent entries in this genre , including nathaniel philbrick 's `` in the heart of the sea '' and mike dash 's `` batavia 's graveyard . '' joan druett 's book is not quite on the level of those two books- they are `` richer '' in their narrative drive and complexity- but `` in the wake of madness '' is still a good , solid `` read . '' the author points out that at the time of the mutiny on the whaleship `` sharon , '' people who were not on board the ship assumed that the south sea islanders who killed captain howes norris did so because they were `` cannibals '' and `` heathens . '' the people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in norris 's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships ' officers . it turns out that captain norris had , over a long period of time , systematically beaten and abused an <NUM> year old crew member ( and apparent fugitive slave ) named george babcock . a combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of babcock . worse still , it appears that norris knew , way before the final denouement , that his actions would result in babcock 's death . it was the result he was looking for . druett speculates on the motivation ( s ) : racism , anger/fear ( norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship ) , frustration ( the `` sharon '' was having very bad luck finding and catching whales ) , etc . of course , harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time . but norris seems to have been especially brutal , even by 19th century standards . babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers , as he feared for his life . his mates did try to protect him , before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers . why did the officers support the captain ? we have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship . going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer ... not exactly good for your career . in any event , it appears that the south sea islanders who killed captain norris were either similarly abused or felt that , given enough time , they would suffer the same fate as babcock . `` in the wake of madness '' works as both an adventure story- as mrs. druett describes the recapture of the `` sharon '' by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when new england whalers met pacific islanders . stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing `` russian roulette . '' on some islands , the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods ( although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that was n't nailed down ) . on other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship . not infrequently , some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and `` go native '' or try to `` sign-on '' with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain . we also learn a little about life back home on martha 's vineyard . the book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced , with mrs. druett attempting to juggle all this in only <NUM> pages . still , this is a generally well-written , interesting book , and worth your time
this was really interesting and not hard to read . enjoyed the information and laughs
i showed this to my middle school dance class and they loved it . i did too ! if you love musicals from this era , it 's a must-see
low production value but excellent information on how to expand pleasure . the woman is `` au natural '' and shows a very simple way to touch herself which i first looks like it is too simple . but once we experimented with it , it sure gives great results . it is quite different from anything else that i have seen . the precision of what she is doing is surprising but undeniable once i saw the signs in her body . if you are looking for a slick production like the one from the big companies , or something equivalent to how pleasure is presented from a man 's perspective in a porn movie , this is not for you and you will be disappointed . but if you are willing to look past that and use the example of a real woman ( not a model that fits everyone criteria of perfect beauty with large breast , shaved genitalia etc . and i shall say i myself would enjoy seeing more women like her that look more like most of us presented as role models ) and if you are willing to look at the information offered about a woman 's pleasure you may very well be pleasantly surprised . i definitively was .
i liked this version of the titanic story when i saw it on the big screen , and i 've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in <NUM> . i 've been a titanic buff for <NUM> years now , and read most of the books . however , last weekend i went to a museum to see `` artifacts of the titanic '' , a collection of more than <NUM> items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down , things once connected to the white star line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater . it was incredibly moving and sad . connected with the exhibit was an imax showing of james cameron 's `` ghosts of the abyss . '' the `` titanic '' director took some of his enormous profits from this <NUM> release , and in <NUM> he rented a russian ship , two submersible submarines , and two robotic cameras , and went down to the wreck himself , taking along actor bill paxton from the movie . the resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent . if you get a chance to see it , or the salvaged items , do n't pass it up . meanwhile , the movie works . so have most of the earlier versions , and so have most of the books , because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes . the fictional parts of cameron 's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster , in my view . seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again , on a big screen .
i love disaster movies , or any disaster movie that involves water - titanic , hard rain , titanic , pearl harbour , titanic ... yeah i love titanic . but i was shocked when watching this film how much titanic resembles it ! there 's a lot where you can see where james cameron might have got some of his ideas from . i felt very claustrophobic watching this film , not only were we watching it in the darkness , but there were also fireworks going off outside , and the film itself is very claustrophobic . there 's no natural light , as the boat is capsized . i had an awful time recognising actors in this , particularly gene hackman . i knew the name , i could not pick out which one he was . ( very blonde moment there . ) i eventually recognised him , cos he was the main character ( big clue there ) , and he was also using simon cowell 's fashion sense - high waisted trousers , and polo neck tucked in . i do n't know why it took me so long to recognise him , but i managed to recognise ernest borgnine , who played rogo , as being in little house in the prairie , in one or two episodes . the poseidon adventure is a really good film , with no need for special effects or cgi , apart from the odd one or two . nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves , when possible , and they would have ended up with many bumps . what made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects , and it made it all the more real . i was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering i was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic , it made it all the more worse . the poseidon adventure is definitely up there as one of my favourite disaster movies now , and i really look forward to seeing the sequel , and the 'remake ' . and i just discovered by looking at imdb , that red buttons ( what a strange name ) was also in little house on the prairie , in two episodes
this book is how popular history should be written . it not only covers the famous figures but does some in-depth history of everyday life . incidentally , a type of history pioneered , and done best , by french historian fernand braudel . another reviewer sites zinn as if it is his original style . his works are bad american copies of the work of the french annales school of historical study

what a wonderful book ! this series is fantastic ; i recommend all of diana gabaldon 's books
a <NUM> 's western comedy featuring mel gibson , maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters . the film does n't take itself so seriously as many films with a western setting tend to do . based on the <NUM> 's television series by the same name in which james garner had a starring role , maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy ... when bret maverick ( mel gibson ) needs $ 25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament , he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs . but he quickly encounters angel ( alfred molina ) , a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill maverick ( his attempt inevitably fails ) . along the way , maverick meets up with ms. annabelle bransford ( jodie foster ) - a slick , conniving poker player who picks maverick 's pocket following a brief romantic encounter . when maverick catches her , he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment . shrinking his designer shirt , annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with maverick running after her . after boarding the boat , the two are joined by marshal zane cooper ( james garner ) - a kind , retired sheriff famous throughout the west . cooper 's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with maverick 's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with ms. bransford . as the three travel cross country , they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff , a showdown with hundreds of indians , and maverick 's financial dealings with an archduke from russia . separated in the confusion , the three eventually meet again on the riverboat lauren belle , home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat 's owner commodore duvall . making use of his quick wit , maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game ( as well as a few thousand extra for annabelle bransford ) . commodore duvall puts marshal zane cooper in charge of guarding the $ 500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which angel also happens to be a participant . but in addition to beating angel , maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge ... overall , maverick is great entertainment . the acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by mel gibson , jodie foster , and james garner . each of the main characters creates a likeable persona . and what makes this movie a must-see ( because the plot leaves much to be desired ) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience . several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious , such as the ones with joseph ( graham greene ) . maverick is n't the type of movie that will win academy awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe , but it is a whole lot of fun . and if you want to do is laugh , give this movie a try ... the dvd repor

braced myself when i rented this because i thought it was not going to be very funny - and i was pleasantly surprised . some parts of it were hilarious - michael richards ( kramer from seinfeld ) has a medium sized role and is as funny as ever . i was not dissapointed . it 's not sophisticated humor , but well worth it for the laughs . very enjoyable
this is a great little movie for d enthusiasts . i feel that if a viewer does n't `` get the d '' they will certainly not like this movie
these heartbreaking words are spoken by quasimodo near the very end of this novel but they could just as easily have been uttered by any number of the characters in this magnificent and awe-inspiring story . because of an inappropriate english translation of the title of this book , not to mention the popular characterization of quasimodo , it is always assumed that the `` half-made '' and hideous-looking bell-ringer of the cathedral of notre dame is the central character of this tragedy , but he is not . his unrequited love for the beautiful la esmeralda is only one of the tragic tales told throughout this novel . the story is set in medieval paris in the year <NUM> . the town has just celebrated the feast of fools with quasimodo being chosen as the reigning pope for the celebration . quasimodo is the adopted son of claude frollo , the archdeacon of notre dame cathedral . la esmeralda is an exquisitely beautiful young gypsy girl who , along with her trained goat , djali , performs throughout the streets of paris to the delight and amusement of the townspeople . dom frollo has been secretly lusting after la esmeralda and believes her to be a witch sent by satan to turn him away from his priestly vows . on the evening of the feast of fools , dom claude enlists quasimodo to help him kidnap the gypsy woman in order to do away with her and rid his life of the temptations she represents . esmeralda is rescued but the night will set into motion a tragic chain of events which will ultimately claim as its victims all three of these central characters . two other victims in this tragedy are dom frollo 's younger brother , jehan , who the archdeacon cared for from the time he was orphaned as infant but who turned out to be a great disappointment and esmeralda 's mother , perhaps the most tragic figure in the entire novel , a woman who believed for fifteen years that her daughter was dead only to be reunited with her and have her taken away again all in the space of a few minutes . this novel is filled with unbelievably vivid descriptions of the city of paris and it 's medieval inhabitants . victor hugo brings the city to life and you will feel as if you are actually walking the streets and experiencing events as they unfold . when quasimodo is tortured upon the wheel in the pillory as punishment for his participation in the attempted kidnaping of esmeralda , you will feel yourself almost a part of the jeering crowd . the scene where esmeralda literally parts the crowd to come forward and offer quasimodo a drink of water has to be one of the most profound in all of literature ! and near the end of the novel when quasimodo is frantically trying to fend off the soldiers and gypsies who are attempting to ram through the door of the cathedral and capture esmeralda , the scenes in which he throws not only boulders but bodies over the balustrade of the church are horrifyingly realistic . it is hard to capture with words all of the feelings that victor hugo evokes with his splendid writing but suffice it to say you will be deeply moved by this story . i have been a fan of the film version with charles laughton and maureen o'hara for many years but as is most always the case , the movie can not hold a candle to the book itself . this novel really defies the ratings here at amazon but as i can only give it at most five stars , i do so wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm . the hunchback of notre dame is definitely the finest classic i have ever read ! -- b. eden
i love the fact that it is n't shallow and hits some tough topics . cameron diaz shines along with toni collette ! shirley maclaine makes the second half of this movie extremely funny
watching the <NUM> the siege in <NUM> and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema . the obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the fbi , cia , military , terrorists , and public responded to the unimaginable : shouts of protests about 'glorification of occult terrorists ' , the hollywood idea of the impossible happening , and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles 'beyond swallowing ' are all here in these reviews . now , six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view , though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious . offensive versus defensive . and after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism ' we continue to lose . movies that make people think and talk are valuable , and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered . yes , there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept , but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as denzel washington , annette bening , tony shalhoub , bruce willis , sami bouajila , ahmed ben larby , aasif mandvi among others . and then there are the panoramas of new york city under siege with the twin towers standing mightily in the cityscape ... it begs the question : if scriptwriter lawrence wright and director edward zwick ( blood diamond , the last samurai , courage under fire , glory , leaving normal , legends of the fall , etc ) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces , why were n't the leaders in washington , dc in tune with 'absurd possibilities ' ? it makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film . grady harp , january <NUM>

`` i 'll be seeing you '' , is a wonderful companion piece to that other moving wartime story produced by david o. selznick in <NUM> , `` since you went away '' , and it provided ginger rogers and joseph cotton with one of their best vehicles during the mid <NUM> 's . dismissed nowadays as a sugar coated romance that piles on the sentiment i dont see that as a failing at all and instead it provides a touching human story about two injured individuals finding love at an unexpected time in their lives when things are not going well . selznick of course will be forever remembered and revered for producing grandiose stories such as `` gone with the wind '' , however his abilities with smaller scale human dramas about seemingly ordinary people in ordinary situations have i feel never been given enough recognition . `` i 'll be seeing you '' , which was based on charles martin 's radio play `` double furlough '' , truly proves my point that his way of approaching smaller scale story telling was just as memorable . here ginger rogers and joseph cotton play two very average and identifiable people , one a victim of the world war currently engulfing the world , and the second an unfortunate victim of one action that had serious consequences , situations any individual could find themselves in . what a joy it was to discover that this beautiful little film has finally been made available via dvd after being so hard to track down for so long . set during world war two `` i 'll be seeing you '' , has ginger rogers as mary marshall a lonely woman who is half way through a prison sentence for a charge of accidental manslaughter who because of her good behaviour is given an eight day leave pass over the christmas period . travelling to visit her relations on the train she meets zachary morgan ( joseph cotton ) , and the two strike up a friendship . zachary has only recently been released from the hospitial as he has been suffering from shell shock and war injuries and the plan is to see if he can speed his recovery by getting out into the world . he implusively follows mary to her stop and pretends that he is visiting his sister in the same town of pine hill . mary arranges for zachary to visit her at the home of her aunt and uncle ( tom tully and spring byington ) , and the pair spend much time together and very quickly fall in love . romance develops for the two as they spend christmas day together and then both attend the ymca dance on new years eve . both however have the dilemma of having to tell the other of their problems and with mary having to report back to prison at the end of the holidays time begins to run out . one their last day in pine hill mary 's younger cousin barbara ( shirley temple ) , unintentionally discloses to zachary about mary 's real situation and in his initial shock and anger he tries to get away from mary as quickly as possible . he boards the train without really saying goodbye to her and mary faces the lonely prospect of life back in prison with no one waiting for her . bidding her family a sad goodbye mary prepares to continue with her sentence but just as she arrives at the prison gates fate takes a pleasant turn for her for once when she is greeted by a remorseful zachary who reaffirms his deep love for her . zachary states firmly that he truly loves her and that whatever it takes they will be together and that he will wait until she is released from prison so that they can be married . a touching love story set at christmas is of course a natural for romantic movie lovers however this effort is much more than just that . fine story telling combines here with well thought out performances by the cast to create a story that leaves you with something to think about in regard to our needs as individuals . ginger rogers especially as the woman out on christmas leave from prison proves once and for all what a fine dramatic actress she truly was among all her other screen talents . she also has a believable and at times quite poignant screen chemistry with joseph cotton as the mentally scarred sargeant just out of hospital that makes us care about these two essentially lonely and hurt individuals . long wanting to be recognised for more than just being fred astaire 's dance partner , here rogers proves that with a well thought out and modulated performance that shows beautifully all her characters insecurities and fears when she finds herself falling in love with cotton 's character . joseph cotton , a selznick contractee delivers another interesting performance here and makes his zachary morgan a very human individual fighting a terrible affliction and then having to learn to deal with his unexpected love for mary . supporting performances are first rate all around . a teenage shirley temple fresh from her triumph in selznick 's classic `` since you went away '' , delivers another fine performance here full of teenage spunk and vivacity and i always think it a tragedy that her later teenage roles for the most part never matched the quality of her work in productions like 'since you went away '' , and `` i 'll be seeing you '' . spring byington who had already worked with ginger rogers in the delightful comedy romance `` lucky partners '' , in <NUM> again combines well with her here as her aunt and despite the two having very different acting styles and screen personas they have a wonderfully relaxed rapport on screen together . `` i 'll be seeing you '' , had the usual meticulous attention to detail recreating in the studio exactly what was still happening in the world at that time ( 1944-45 ) . like in all war times there is always humour in among the sorrow and this production provides just that , for example in the dress shop scene , and at the ymca new years eve ball , and these are randomly situated between the more serious goings on throughout the film 's running time . of course the drama here is what makes `` i 'll be seeing you '' , such a standout and is vividly represented in scenes such as mary 's terrible recollection to barbara of the incident that put her in jail , through to zachary 's ongoing efforts to curb his mental sufferings resulting from his active duties . director william dieterle keeps the pace of the story moving and we see a growing inner confidence developing in both mary and zachary that sees them overcome their fears and lack of trust in others to follow their hearts in their feelings for each other . tender romances about ordinary people who are not perfect are seldom seen nowadays but the strength of `` i 'll be seeing you '' , rests in its ability to make two such ordinary people infinitely interesting and people who we care about . i 've always enjoyed the great talents of both ginger rogers and joseph cotton and the two make most believable lovers here . the charming christmas setting taking place during the dark war years is guarenteed to tug at the heart strings of any romantic movie lover and it never fails to move me with its simple message of love and respect for others no matter what their affliction or failings are . take a romantic journey back soon to a simple war time hollywood love story to see how effectively it could be portrayed on screen in selznick productions , `` i 'll be seeing you '' .
excellent film . it explores the inefficiencies of bureaucracy and paints a bleak picture of a police state , which seems ever more realistic . the acting is fantastic and the ideas presented in this movie are second to none . if you like this movie , also check out a scanner darkly and logan 's run
we rented this movie not expecting too much . we like this genre ( moron movies ) . unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie , we had no trouble at all following the plot . we just thought this movie was a scream ! lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell . what 's not to like ? if you like this type of movie , you will love it ! mac mccaule
this book is great . if you ever have a problem with your child 's behavior , mrs. piggle wiggle is the one to call . her outrageous solutions to common child behavior ailments seem to work well . in most cases she recommends letting the child wallow in his or her own awful behavior until rock bottom is reached . only then is the child aware of the real-life consequences for bad behavior . a perfect book for teaching personal responsibility . not to mention it 's filled with fun names like mrs. moohead , mrs. broomrack , and mrs. crankminor . my only complaint is mrs. piggle-wiggle herself is present for only a very small percentage of the book , and the book ends without even going back to her . i was thinking ( and hoping ) she 'd be on every page . this goes to show you , mrs. piggle-wiggle , who loves kids more than anybody , still lets them bring on their own suffering when it comes to correcting a major attitude problem . if a kid does n't want to eat ... shoot , let the kid starve . if the kid does n't want to pick up toys , then let the kid get trapped in clutter . show kids what it 's like to have to clean up their own mess instead of cleaning up their mess for them all the time . ( this does n't apply to diaper changes of course . ) in addition to the elaborate piggle-wiggle cures , the kids in the book get a spanking from their parents every now and then , especially after playing around with the laundry chute . sorry kids , ca n't do that
picked this dvd up on a whim . i personally had n't heard anything about it , but i saw it was directed by one of the guys who co-wrote and co-directed ( whatever that means ) the blair witch project . that 's not great , but it was something to go on . in the very least it promised that the storyline might be innovative . i thought altered was really good ! it 's a pretty simple plot : three hicks , who have been hunting aliens for seven years , finally catch one and take it to their friend 's house . the friend , wyatt , has had contact with the aliens before , having been abducted nearly fifteen years ago . most of the hijinks involves these four guys wyatt 's girlfriend and the abducted alien . the story is sort of derivative , combining elements from night of the living dead , the original alien and maybe a dash of signs . but this managed to take those pieces and still make a highly suspenseful film ! the characters were fleshed out just enough where you cared what happened to them . honestly adam kaufman 's wyatt stole the show . the man has charisma . as for the rest , in this day and age where every horror character is a sassy b * tch , it was nice to see dialog that was restrained and functional . they still managed to sneak a few jokes in , but they were so subtle and/or situational that it worked pretty well . the only one who comes across as an amateur is the girlfriend . i 've seen oak trees that were less wooden than her delivery . still , considering this was a nobody , no publicity , nothing , straight to video indie flick i 'm surprised at how good she was in comparison to other similar projects . the special effects were pretty good . everything was hand made special effects , so you do n't have any of that fakey cgi smeared around . movies ten times the budget have n't learned that lesson yet . the character design for the alien was pretty good . it sported an animatronic face and probably a small , athletic bloke in a rubber suit with the result being some of the best monster realism since aliens . the best part was the disembowel scene ; realistic without being disgusting , a chuckling that's- got ta -hurt moment if i ever saw one . really , this was a pleasant surprise , given where the sequel to the blair witch went . maybe eduardo sanchez has a future in horror after all
if you like sick beats and clean flows , mack and ad kapone come dope on this album . also on this is dre dog who brings some more ill mannered rhymes . this cds old but its worth the money
this is my favourite movie , and the cinematography and music are amazing . in addition the various themes of belonging , loss , betrayal , and love , there is the fact that all these characters caught up in the war are so young . the disfigured caravaggio , the naive and delightful hana , the sikh who defuses bombs ... they are all young people who are still adjusting to the fact that life does n't always give you what you want - less so during times of war . we even see how young the english patient is during flashbacks , though he looks older and seems wiser since his experiences of physical and emotional loss . he knows he 's dying , but everyone around him is also aware that they too , could die at any time ; that 's not something that young people usually think about on a regular basis . it is a beautiful film . it is also a deep film that reveals how different people respond to the fact that they could die any day
i use her recipe for cleansing grains every day . it 's the only thing i 've found that cleans my super dry skin without leaving it drier . also used her directions to henna my hair for the first time . i order her products as well and they are all wonderful
i love this movie i watched a lot and i cant wait to get the cheetah girls <NUM> movie in nov or dec they my favorite movie and i all the girls in it they did they parts well
i 'm a brazilian doctorean student in supply chain management , and this book is being very important for my studies . it is about the risk end vulnerability that one enterprise can occours , and show examples and tools to use when a disruption occours . very good
another good effort , i like this one better than the last . band is tight and the production is great . jeff 's jesus song is awesome . however , jim 's singing is poor . he 's a fine producer , but come on -- he would get polite applause at best at your local open mike . this is n't a 3rd grade pageant -- not everyone gets to sing , pal
this is one of my all-time favorite the firm tapes . it is a great combination of cardio and strength . the time flys when i 'm doing this tape . i read the reviewer that said that these reviews were not by 'real ' people . i 'm very real and in no way connected to the firm company or any of it 's affiliates . ( sounds like legalize , but it 's true ) . i discovered the firm a couple years ago and discovered that even though i thought i was in good shape , i was wrong . firm tapes really put you through the paces . if you really do the tapes and stick with them , you will get stronger and feel better . i did n't loose a ton of weight , but i did get fit enough to be able to do a triathlon this last summer . i 've been doing workouts since before we had vhs tapes ( i used audio tapes that came with a poster that showed the moves ) . i 've tried just about every exercise instructor out there . they all have good and bad and so does the firm . but , all in all , i have to say that the firm workouts are the hardest , safest , most effective , and most fun i 've ever done .
hearts in atlantis by stephen king the girl who loved tom gordon by stephen king two reviews in one ? what up with that ? well , i read hearts in atlantis some time ago and , beyond `` rah rah go read this , '' i said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer . how stupid was that ? i 'm going to try again . i finished reading my life by bill clinton late one tuesday afternoon , then immediately picked up the man who loved tom gordon . i figured my old friend stephen king could clear my exhausted mind . he immediately pulled me in , and i read it in a single sitting . it 's gripping stuff . incredibly realistic , insightful regarding human nature , and it 'll scare your pants off . the master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book . ditto with atlantis . authors , how do you feel when you spend months ( years ? ) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening ? actually , i think you oughta feel good . no writer , not even isaac asimov , could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs . i think this is very cool , and i love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do . okay , back to my book review . king was always great , right ? but there came a point where a certain sameness crept in . it 's hard to define , perhaps , but you know what i mean . i do n't think he was having as much fun as he used to , and after a time , neither were we . then came on writing , which i never run out of breath raving about , and now books like these . he 's scaling back the supernatural , which never bothered me at all , because he 's found even scarier things to write about . the master has raised his game , and it 's a joy to know i 've got a big old pile of unread stephen king novels downstairs . expect more rave reviews . oh , and stephen , if you 're reading this , and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again , just let me know . i 'll go rent a truck and hit you with it . ( it 's a joke . just like the idea that you subscribe to my rag . i know you 'd rather read dave 's rag . )
this has got to be one of my favorite new albums out right now . i bought this a few weeks ago in nyc mostly based on the reviews comparing feeder to coldplay . the comparison isi n't entirely accurate . but right now it seems everyone coming out who 's british is being compared to coldplay . feeder still sounds like feeder but they 've expanded their music as well as their lyrics . one of the best tracks is track # <NUM> . it has dougie payne and fran healy of travis doing background vocals . it 's simply awesome . if you want a great record to hold you over until the new coldplay and travis , then get this . but please , everybody stop comparing everyone to coldplay ! give these guys their own credit
i have been a long time fan of cold . the newer more mellow cold is definately the best sound they have produced yet . the third album `` year of the spider '' is not too far behind and that is for sure , but the old cold was not as emotional and vocally talented as the the new cold . cold has lost some talent intramentally , yet i do n't see this as a bad thing . scooter ward is so talented vocally there is no need for instruments to attempt to drown him out . give ward the stage ! this fresh sound from cold is certainly implemented in the title track , as it is only ward and his beloved piano for the most part of the song . the intruments are there but there is certainly no need . the song writing ability of ward can not be matched by anyone in the rock genre . this is a kind of parent-friendly grunge-flavored soft rock that 1-ups every kind of alternative rock out there which seems to be all screams and f-bombs nowadays . if you like rock this is the album for you . if it does n't hit the spot the first time try round two and you will agree
this is a wonderful selection of the martin and lewis colgate comedy hours . the show used revolving hosts , and eddie cantor and martin and lewis were by far the most popular . for those that are only familiar with the team through their films , this collection will be a revelation . the duo 's television appearances are only a slightly toned down version of their live act-and that was legendary . the show dates are not indicated on the packaging , so here they are : 1-2/4/51 , 2-1/25/53 , 3-11/4/51 , 4-4/29/51 , 5-12/19/54 ( next to last appearance ) , 6-11/13/55 ( last appearance and the next-to-last episode of the show ) , 7-no date can be found , but it is the 8th anniversary of the team on the comedy hour , broadcast from atlantic city . the set also includes trailers for some of their films-great stuff , especially for the films filmed in vistavision , where the process is promoted as much as the team . ( & quot ; bigger , brighter , funnier ! & quot ; ) grab this one
this dvd is the best historical presentation of martin luther ever and the corruption that existed in the middle age church , which would not change until there were such violent protest in northern europe . i recently purchased <NUM> copies and in total i have purchased about <NUM> copies to give as gifts . i also requested our local library purchase a copy . i do not consider this dvd as entertainment , but it is history done better than any other historical film . one should also research the events occuring in england , and the americas which were part of the holy roman empire , and understand that charles v , holy roman emperor , is a great-nephew of catherine of argon , king henry viii 's first wife ; and that he is also a decendent of ferdnand and isabel of spain . the dvd will allow you to see the logic behind selling indulgences and the need to finance st peters basilica in rome . this is a dvd that you will want to view several times as it is so profound . peter ustinov and alfred molina give unforgetable performances in supporting roles
dr. glinsky managed to write a complete factual book and yet have all the action and suspense that you would commonly find in an espionage novel
yes , this movie is awe-inspiring , awesome ( i 'm running out of adjectives here , lol ) but will certain film critics ( roger ebert i hope you read this ) stop going around and saying how everything with dark humor , odd narrative , talky dialogue , etc. , is tarantino-esque ? ? without godard writing the blueprint on how to be a film essayist , there would n't be a tarantino-esque ( qt also owes a lot to elmore leonard , scorsese , depalma , and blaxploitation. ) . if i read one more review from overrated critic ebert about how tarantino paved the way for filmmakers that have a godardian bite to their films , i might kill myself , lol he never says how great of an influence godard had on tarantino . nor does any other critics say how godard 's `` breathless '' created modern cinema . its as though these critics totally ignored godard 's methods , and pretend geeks like tarantino created them . shame on you ebert . that 's like saying christina aguilera created that soulful yet high-scale histeronic singing she does , when whitney houston and mariah carey did it before her . give people the credit they deserve
this was also a very influential hip hop album ( biggie smalls ) one of the best rappers ever classic album kane was the biggie of the <NUM> 's nobody could touch him
jean-marie potiez has produced a wonderful book . the fantastic photos ( many of which have not previously been published ) are worth the price of the book alone . the photos must have been very carefully selected : they are all , unfailingly , flattering and the band never look less than achingly glamorous . the informative and enjoyable commentary , pieced together from a mind-boggling number of interviews , is clearly a labour of love and there are many surprisingly revealing and poignant quotes . particularly sweet ( and , ultimately , sad , given the couple 's subsequent history ) is frida 's statement that the best thing that ever happened to her was benny , not abba . the history of the ultimate pop group is traced on a year-by-year basis , from the mid 1960s , following the pre-abba careers of each member , through the romantic encounters , to the eurovision win , to the will-we-ever-have-another-hit ? tension , to ( phew ! ) world domination . every step is lavishly illustrated with great photos . abba 's story reads like a film script - humble beginnings , beautiful people in love , amazing talent , runaway success leading to a heartbreaking denoument . there is even a 'where are they now ? ' epilogue . this book wipes the floor with potiez 's video documentary of the band ( & quot ; thank you abba & quot ; ) . while it will certainly be a treasured luxury for abba 's huge army of fans , this excellent book will also be of interest to anybody with an interest in perfect pop
kurosawa 's magnificent homage to the poor and suffering in the world . set in a rural health clinic in the 1800s , toshiro mifune plays the kindly but dictatorial head doctor , and yuzo kayama is a young , selfish , and self-centered intern who comes reluctantly to the clinic and learns humility . through magnificent acting and superior direction , the movie captures the heart-rending trials and tribulations of these peasant people . three `` stories '' predominate : a totally selfless man 's death-bed cenfession about his wife and his loyalty to her ; a 12-year-old girl 's learning that there are good people in the world ; and a 7-year-old boy 's family who takes poison rather than starve any longer . there is a haunting scene where women are `` calling back '' the life of a boy from a well , according to a folk belief . at three hours the movie is perhaps a tad too long , but it 's fair to say we do n't lose interest for a minute . kurosawa called this `` a monument to the goodness in man . '' indeed . definitely worth a watch
this book is one of the best novels ever written . it is still current today and keeps you turning the pages . you will not regret this purchase
i read some other reviews about this book saying that it is confusing , etc . i was not confused . i found this book very interesting , although it is not what i originally thought it would be . ultimately , i used ideas from this book combined with the ideas from generative programming to solve a programming problem quite successfully
hey , what 's up ? this is my first review . at first i did n't feel it was necessary ; paul 's boutique already has five stars , and deserves every one of them . still , the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it , too . this album is near perfect . the only track i feel is weak ( and it 's not even that bad ) is egg man . i did n't dig it at first ... but it grew on me , so i 'll give it a listen , now , especially for the sampling ( as mentioned by another reviewer ) . every single track on the album is linked . i think this adds alot to it , because it 's like a non-stop track . very enjoyable . if you 're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the beastie boys , definitely cop this album . solid gold hits is n't great , and the anthology is n't worth it . all beastie boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker . get paul 's boutique
there is a profound need for americans to read books about non-western cultures . this is especially true for those in political leadership positions . things fall apart , by chinua achebe , is one such book . i learned about things fall apart for the first time recently on somebody 's blog . i picked it up from the library two days ago and finished it today . things fall apart is the story of okonkwo , a leader in the village of umuofia in nigeria . the story is told from the point of view that the ibo culture of okonkwo 's people . this culture is profoundly different from that of 21st century america . a significant part of this book is spent establishing the culture and society for the reader . in the first part of the book , the cultural constructs hold the society together , even though things fall apart on occasion on a personal level for okonkwo and others in the book . but things fall apart for the culture as a whole as a result of the arrival of christian missionaries and british colonial rulers . the story of how this happens to okonkwo and his village is told in a simple , accessible , but gripping way . if you read this book , do not use the speed reading technique of reading the end first . just read it through , and will find that the very last paragraph provides the exclamation point that makes this book 's message so important
los lonely boys , the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from texas , is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that 's one part rock & roll , one part country , one part chicano , one part lullaby and <NUM> parts stone-cold gorgeous . because i 'm a big hip hop fan who loves pavoratti , i do n't often find myself in this aisle of the music store . ( and by the way what aisle is this ? ) but a friend gave me this cd and after letting it sit , collecting dust for over a year , i popped it into the stereo on a whim . what a wonderful surprise . almost like love at first hear , i found myself bopping along to literally every tune , as though i had grown on this music . these guys are amazing singers , musicians and song writers . bilingual , they often switch back and forth from english lyrics to spanish ad libs . plus it contains two versions of more than love , one in english and the other in spanish -- which reminds the listener of their texican roots . double sided , this cd features <NUM> songs on one side and <NUM> videos on the other . some are acoustic and reveal just how talented ( not to mention charming ) this band is . because i know so little about country , rock & rock and mexican-twinged music , it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band 's sound to anyone else 's , but if forced to i 'd say sting . not because it sounds like sting 's music , but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you 've heard these songs all of your life . plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious . -- regina mcmenami
great to see gregory peck having such a good time playing arch-menace joseph mengele . the plot is plausible , if somewhat naive and short in the hard science department , but i 'd suspend my disbelief to watch sir laurence olivier play this nazi hunter anyday . the rest of the cast are a bit like card board cut-out villians and good guys , but the boy hittler is a kid only a she-wolf mother could love
i 've been a fan of the cardigans ever since their first cd release in usa and when i 've heard that some band members were doing solo i was very anxious to hear them . i think that nina 's cd is art in its purest form . each song is carefully put together like a collage to form a trully unique piece . i found my self experiencing different moods as i listened to each of the songs . some other very good songs were actually not released on this cd . songs such as & quot ; charlie charle & quot ; , & quot ; my misery is my mystery & quot ; , and & quot ; what the hell are you crying for ? & quot ; but dont worry you can still hear these songs . for those of you who do n't know nina has a special website for her cd its : http : //www.acamp.cjb.net/ . there she has an option of listening the unreleased songs . i hope this review has helped you in some way
it 's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it does n't make sense . i bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who <NUM> years later land a usage role in a classic tv show . robert stack plays the role of captain larkin , hugh o'brien plays the role of detective daniel myerson , and the beautiful young women was farrah fawcett majors who played the role of karen white . this was your typical airplane movie where it took about <NUM> minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight <NUM> . after the jumbo jet takes off captain larkin gets a radio call from security in new york city . first , a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box . next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers . at first , it is thought to be a sick joke , but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed . it is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases . all and all the weasel gives this movie <NUM> star . as far as farrah fawcett majors goes , she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge .
the first time i saw this movie , there was one scene which scared me ; the scene where mary 's parents are dying from the plague ( i think it was cholera ? ) . the music they use for this can send chills down someone 's back ; i know because it did mine . apart from that , i loved the movie . i do n't know why they had to have dickon killed , though . ( ben weatherstaff and mary talk at the end of the movie ; we find out that dickon was killed in the war . ) i like how colin and mary meet at the end and how mary held off on saying yes to colin 's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden . something else i 'm wondering : was this movie set during world war <NUM> or world war <NUM> ?
this is probably one of my favorites . she has characters you care about from the beginning and the deceased father 's entangling demands to inherit his property and money are an added way of punishing his children for his indifference to them thoughout their lives
this novel was difficult for me to get into . the noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry . after training myself to think in terms of the language , i found myself so engrossed in the story that i moved through it at a steady pace . definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding
if you want to relive your days in the <NUM> ' use this cd to bring back old memories of what you were up to then . fantastic , even better than before enhanced by cd quality
i loved the videos on this dvd although i too could have done without the fan footage . however , if you are a kenny chesney fan , i think you definitley would want this for your collection
for all you fans that like classic rock what can be a better dvd than this ... chicago & ew & f . this dvd is absolutely amazing . it contains all the classic songs from both of the legendary bands with a few special suprises and twists . this is a must have in any serious rock fans collection . the sound and picture is absolutely supurb . a truly top notch classic dvd from <NUM> of the best legends of music in the business .. do not miss this ..
a good beginner 's book for those interested in building their own speakers without getting into heavy mathematics , passive electronics , complex woodworking , or folded horns . the book explains some the rudiments of speaker theory , and barely enough to design your own simple crossover network . the book has several economical projects which the author already debugged and are ready to build , including : the make and model of the speakers , list of passive components , schematic - which usually include extras like a zobel network , and the cabinet dimensions . their are several two-way projects and one three-way with a ten-inch woofer . most designs use a soft-dome tweeter , if that 's what you like . there is a list of raw component vendors in the back of the book . the designs for the ported boxes use the thiel method , and i am finding that this may be conservatively sized toward the large side with respect to a flat bass response . the prose is a bit wordy , but still easy to read . overall , i have learned a few things from this book
i was very lucky to have seen cat stevens during the majikat tour in <NUM> . since then i have always wanted to have a way to recapture the memories of that great concert . the dvd and this cd of the majikat tour are perfect ! outstanding sound quality , great songs passionately performed . for those who have cat 's cds , this is a wonderful addition to your collection . for those just getting into cat 's music , a great way to see and hear the `` majik '' of his music . outstanding ! ! !
what i love about this cd is that it has a song for just about every mood you could have . vocals are astounding .
ever since i played final fantasy ix , i 've wanted to buy a soundtrack of it . i thought of buying the original soundtrack , but it cost more than $ <NUM> , and i did n't have that much money . so i decided on this cd and it was worth it . most of the songs on this cd are even better than the originals , and i was n't going to listen to most of the songs on the original so ... it 's worth every penny
this is a must for all natalie wood fanatics ! the girl is beautiful and talented . the film is honest and compelling for it 's time . altough sometimes a little too `` opinionated '' in sexual themes such as the fate of beatty 's `` tramp '' of a sister and the dividing of bad and good girls , the theme that the warren beatty 's charachter is ready for sex and natalie 's is n't is portrayed very honestly and movingly . see also the first french kiss on a hollywood movie ! ! blink and you 'll miss it
for a `` best of '' this album has a fantastic track list . the sound quality is that great vintage `` pulp fiction '' surf rock sound that we have all grown to appreciate . it 's a buy even if you have just the smallest of urges to listen to what this stuff is all about . dick dale is the godfather of this sound , that has become the staple of this form of rock
transaction codes , good explanations , clever questions , well throughout answers and bonus material beyond anything else out there . great book and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning bw or interviewing someone for a bw job
to see the workings of a crisis , minute by minute , day by day from the inside , is incredible . i have renewed respect for kennedy and all those who averted disaster . maybe someday they 'll release the krushchev tapes and we 'll be able to see both antagonists
i have listened to the don shirley trio since the <NUM> 's . my favorite song of all time is & quot ; water boy & quot ; . if i were shipwrecked on a desert isle and i could only have one recording this is the one . this man knows how to make music for the soul . the trio 's interpretation of tunes that are familiar brings a whole new meaning to the songs . each time i listen i want to get up and move to the music
if i had used the `` make the dog obey '' theories and techniques on my opinionated male great dane , he would n't be here today . he is too big for me to `` make '' him do anything . he is also a sensitive beast and needs encouragement not punishment . i had to find ways that did <NUM> things : make it easier for him to do what i asked and offer him the rewards that he values . pat miller 's book showed me how to do that . pat 's book gives the theory and the practical steps to apply to your dog . one book can not cover all possible situations but as the basic primer for most dogs and their humans , this one does the job . this book is the one at the top of my list . it 's for people new to dogs and to those who want a way to train themselves and their dog into a more comfortable and complementary relationship
if you liked amelie , this one is definitely for you ... a good movie , that you can see to many times , every time you will unsertand a diferent thing ...
whats up with the first guy this is predictable come on any way for you hd dvd boys and girls its clear and clean nothing you would put in and go wow look at that donkey ! and whats is that kid doning in hi def watching that donkey ? and the sound is not going to show off that 5.1 but if your a fan of hd and clerks then put it in your cart and enjoy animal erotica
i was having alot of problems and none of the several doctors and one specialist i tried knew what to do with me . i bought several thyroid books , but this one answered all of my questions . the author is eminently qualified to write this book , and has done so in a readable and down to earth , yet detailed way . thyroid problems can affect every aspect of your life in ways you might not imagine -- you need to be well informed and this book will do it
stevie ray vaughan 's original greatest hits album was far too short at just <NUM> not particularly well chosen tracks , but this <NUM> addition goes a long way towards making up for that . it is not a hits package per se , since most of these songs were never released as singles , but it features lots of excellent songs like `` willie the wimp '' , `` ai n't gone 'n ' give up on love '' , `` empty arms '' , and vaughan 's magnificent rendition of doyle bramhall 's acoustic survivor story `` life by the drop '' . that still does n't make it a definitive career retrospective , though , even when coupled with `` greatest hits '' vol . i , and the inclusion of tunes like `` pipeline '' and `` superstition '' is suspect considering what has been left out . at <NUM> songs , these two albums are trumped by the superb double-disc collection `` the essential stevie ray vaughan and double trouble '' , which is cheaper than `` greatest hits '' vol . i and ii together , yet features a stronger selection of songs , and six more of them as well
missing measures is a great book . steele is a remarkable scholar . the book is well researched and written in a style that is easy to understand as well as being a very enjoyable book . it 's of interest to anyone who enjoys poetry , formal or not . this is a great text in literary history/criticism . and it is important for those who want to understand the modernist movement
for some born in the usa is the greatest the boss ever delivered , for others it 's the start of a steady decline . often mistaken for an overly patriotic statement this album found bruce suddenly among the ranks of eighties superstars as prince , madonna and michael jackson . born in the usa is the reason why some place the boss in the same category as jon bon jovi , born in the usa sounds as a stadium blow-out . yet lyrics as `` born down in a dead man 's town , the first kick i took was when i hit the ground , you end up like a dog that 's been beat too much , till you spend half your life just covering up '' could hardly be called patriotic or shallow . born in the usa was the follow-up for nebraska , a sparse demo-like recording . a lot of the material here was culled from those sessions and had the e-street bravura added to them . the title track was originally a one-man rockabilly outing but transformed in e-street synth-rock . the same treatment songs as dancing in the dark , glory days or i 'm on fire got . it 's that treatment that 's ultimately the weakness of the record . today born in the usa sounds hopelessly dated at times . the listener is forced to listen beyond the production for its depth and meaning . at the time of its release it was no different . a lot of the lyrics meanings tend to get lost in the poppy production that made it so successful . it is also one of springsteen least cohesive efforts . the styles on the album range from pop to rockabilly , from stadium rock to folk . for those who take the effort to dig deeper into the record there is a wealth in the songs that is rarely matched by other artists . as never before springsteen paints a picture of those of us who fail to be a part of the american dream . there is the obvious post-vietnam protest song of the title track , not allowing us to forget , and its attack on reaganism . but there is more . in i 'm on fire the character bears his soul as bruce sings , `` at night i wake up with the sheets soaking wet , and a freight train running through the , middle of my head , only you can cool my desire '' . sex being the means through which the character forgets his angst for just a moment . similar sentiments are found in dancing in the dark , bruce 's ultimate pop effort . `` man i 'm just tired and bored with myself '' screams the character , `` hey there baby , i could use just a little help '' , hardly a light and upbeat lyric . the people in springsteen 's songs seem to be stuck in their lives , unable to get ahead . the chances the american dream offers us are accessible only to just some of us . the rest are left behind `` just sitting back trying to recapture , a little of the glory of , well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but , boring stories of glory days ''
i purchased this book because i was interested in getting into circuit bending to create my own new instruments to use in tandem with our laptop-driven experimental music project . this book is great , even if you 're not already an electronics geek . very simple and direct . also , reed ghazala has a totally appreciable geeky sense of humour . i was laughing out loud as i was learning . i recommend this book strongly to anyone interested in getting into circuit bending .
i 'm sure walters is on to something , but i 'm having trouble squaring the idea of my wife 's constant chatter with this nagging sense that i 'm the poorer for it
no other book has ever shown us novice decorators how to light a room , arrange our art and furniture as well as this one . it is easy to follow and sticks to its promise that we do not have to buy all new furniture to make our home look really pretty . anyone who would like to give their home an extreme makeover without throwing away what they already have will be truly amazed at what they can accomplish after reading use what you have decorating
this is a pretty good effort for a warner home video dvd release.you get two laurel & hardy feature films on one single sided disc with nice artwork.considering that these films are over <NUM> years old the audio & video quality is surprisingly good.if you 're a fan of laurel & hardy , this dvd is definitely for you.this is good clean fun from one of the best comedy teams ever
this book is great for students who are thinking of persuing a course in engineering . ferguson adresses what makes a great engineer , and also states that many schools do not stress the courses they should . using this book , students gain insight as to what they should expect from being an engineer , and what is imporant in the profession . i definately recommend this book to those who are about to be college freshman engineers or are thinking of changing over from liberal arts & amp ; sciences to engineering

u turn ( oliver stone , <NUM> ) i 'm a big fan of stray dogs , the john ridley novel upon which u-turn is based , and i avoided the film for while because , really , how many film adaptations of your best-loved novels actually work the way you want them to ? i should n't have worried , though ; u-turn is the stuff , most decidedly . the plot : bobby cooper , an on-the-run tennis pro ( sean penn ) has his car conk out on him just shy of a very , very weird little desert town . one of its residents , grace mckenna ( jennifer lopez ) , immediately catches his eye , but he soon finds out she 's married to a nasty old character named jake ( nick nolte ) , who 'd just as soon see her dead -- and offers bobby fifty grand to do the deed . immediately , a complex web of deceit unfurls among all the characters , complicated by a number of even stranger events happening at just the wrong time to make bobby 's life miserable . the main thing that sticks out about this movie is the caliber of its cast , and the caliber of the performances they give . when you have to stick jon voight and billy bob thornton seventh and eighth in credits order , you 've got a high-powered cast working for you . all of them are spot on . the plot moves forward at almost blinding speed ( just as it did in the book ; ridley adapted his own novel ) , and the viewer has very little time to do anything but clench his teeth and hang on for the ride until the final credits roll . it 's just plain fun . i 'm not sure why i stopped watching oliver stone flicks in the late eighties ( okay , yeah i am -- born on the fourth of july , the doors , and jfk back to back got a little heavy in to the world of way-out conspiracy theory for me ) , but i 'm glad i 've started again . * * * Ω
this is in response to the concerns a couple people have raised about the theme song . in the original broadcast run the theme song was sung by studio singers for the first <NUM> or so episodes only . after that new vocals were recorded by johnny mathis and denise williams over the same backing tracks and their vocals were heard on all subsequent episodes . that is exactly what happens on these dvds . after episode <NUM> we get the mathis/williams recording on all the remaining episodes . i have all these early episodes on vhs recorded many years ago and the theme song - with both pairs of singers - is exactly the same
this is a glimpse into an amazing way of life which , for the most part , no longer exists . the filmmaker was an explorer before he became a filmmaker , so great care is taken to tell these people 's story , through the example of one main character : nanook , the bear . i was pleased at how well this work has been preserved and transfered to the new medium of dvd . if you are interested in the arctic region , anthropology , history , or even great adventure , you will enjoy nanook of the north
this <NUM> club date was miles ' first ever authorized live recording and it features a quintet miles was to discard a couple of years later in favor of a newer , younger group . the music of the later group ( featuring wayne shorter , herbie hancock , ron carter and tony williams ) was an experimental group that played around with timbral innovations , unusual harmonies , atonality and rapid tempo changes , leading all five members of the group to later experiments in jazz-rock fusion . the music they produced was inaccessible to many and its status as true `` jazz '' has justifiably been questioned by those who believe jazz must be fundamentally rooted in swing and blues . the jazz status of this <NUM> group , however , can not be questioned . it is arguably the last true mainstream jazz group that miles ever led and these recordings show the group at its best . for me , the highlights of this set include cole porter 's `` all of you '' in which the talented and underrated tenorman , hank mobley , delivers a magnificent , powerful blues-oriented solo that upstages the understated miles himself ! mobley 's characteristic tone is unmistakable . miles ' own `` so what '' is even more impressive here than the famous version on the kind of blue album . the modal song is taken at a brisk tempo and miles ' solo is incisive , hard-driving , and completely assured - a masterful performance . mobley 's solo is also a fine one , and pianist wynton kelly delivers a typically fleet-fingered , exciting solo of his own . miles ' mastery of melancholia shows on monk 's `` round midnight '' which miles performs brilliantly and movingly , though the other solos are not as noteworthy . miles again shows his lyrical mastery on the lovely romantic johnny mercer ballad , `` i thought about you '' . backing miles , mobley and kelly are miles ' longtime bassist paul chambers and drummer jimmy cobb , both of whom are consistently solid . if musical experimentation in the free jazz or fusion vein is what you like , then this album will probably seem unprogressive and unappealing to you . if , however , you prefer the mainstream jazz tradition as represented by the likes of armstrong , tatum , parker , monk , gillespie , and rollins , then you wo n't likely be disappointed by these performances . they represent one of miles ' best and last contributions to the mainstream jazz tradition .
my name is amanda and i 'm in a 10th grade world history class . we are currently studying the great depression and wwii and we have just finished watching brother , can you spare a dime . this movie helped me to understand not only the culture and life of this era but also helped me to understand the things that led up to the depression and stock market crash as well as pearl harbor and wwii . i 'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants an entertaining way to learn a bit about history
i heard `` dirty harry '' on upop xm and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album . then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she did n't know the title or artist . the station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be `` feel good inc '' from the same album ! the choice was now clear ! log on the amazon ! a first listen to the whole album was good , but not as good as i had anticipated . the second , third , and fourth listen hooked me good ! i even like the <NUM> cuts i first thought were terrible . now i will be getting a second album so i do n't have to share
they 've inducted that macolm mclaren money-making hype `` punk '' band the sex pistols into the rock 'n roll hall of fame ( mclaren 's other great creation was bow wow wow ) who arrived two years after the cbgb thing in new york in '74 ( brit kids seeing the ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did ) . those laughable geezers black sabbath have been inducted ( though they had their moments in their early albums ) . even billy joel is an inductee ( thanks to the evil & damned for eternity jann wenner ) ! ! but neither the stooges nor iggy are to be found listed ; their first album came out in <NUM> , which would have made them elegible in <NUM> ; <NUM> years of tripe . a lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission . then again , perhaps not being in the r'nr hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow , ugly , painful death ( see `` alternative '' music since the early '90 's leading to the likes of avril levine or . . . or any other `` serious '' , `` sensitive '' `` hip '' whiney , over-hyped , worthless bands these days ) .
i stumbled on liza picard 's books quite by chance . after looking at the publishing date in some of the books it is apparent some of them have been around for several years . i am now recommending them to anyone and everyone and i am so glad i stumbled across the first one i read on a rainy afternoon , lonely and far away from home . i have now read them all . as soon as you start to read the book it becomes apparent that the author is passionate about her subject and wants the reader to enjoy the reading experience as much as she has in the writing of it . liza picard presents an enthralling picture of how life in london was really lived in the 1600s : the houses and streets , gardens and parks , cooking , clothes and jewellery , cosmetics , hairdressing , housework , laundry and shopping , medicine and dentistry , sex , education , hobbies , etiquette , law and crime , religion and popular beliefs . to anyone who has not read the author 's books perhaps these subjects seem boring and mundane , but they are written about with such knowledge and wit that they literally come to life in the readers imagination . liza picard was born in <NUM> . she read law and qualified as a barrister but did not practice . quite where she gleaned all this information from i am not sure . that it was a labour of love is obvious to anyone who reads her books and i for one am grateful

in the streets of new york city where the homeless live in a junkyard and on the streets , two bum brothers named fred ( mike lackey ) and kevin ( mark sferrazza ) are living together in a hut of a auto-wreck place thinking that their lives have become crap for them . a liquor store owner however discovers in his store a old box of special liquor called `` vipor '' that is <NUM> years old and sells them for a buck , unfortunately it has a bad side effect on those who drink it would literally melt or explode . an original , tasteless , and entertaining horror comedy has gained a cult following since it was released in <NUM> , sure the acting can be bad but the movie has awesome gore , melting and body explosion make-up effects with a dark sense of humor to help the flick . there 's also some nudity for those who love nudity , nicely photographed and also star r.l . ryan ( the actor who played the fat mayor on `` the toxic avenger '' ) as a boss . the dvd has sharp picture and nice sound quality as the only extra is the theatrical trailer , this is a must have dvd for fans of horror comedies , gore flicks , troma movies and peter jackson 's early works . also recommended : `` the toxic avenger '' , `` c.h.u.d . `` , `` dead alive ( a.k.a . braindead ) '' , `` class of nuke'em high '' , `` the incredible melting man '' , `` day of the dead '' , `` re-animator '' , `` from dusk till dawn '' , `` riki-oh : the story of ricky '' , `` tetsuo the iron man '' , `` the stuff '' , `` an american werewolf in london '' , `` cabin fever '' , `` videodrome '' , `` caligula '' , `` the new york ripper '' , `` maniac ( <NUM> ) '' , `` land of the dead '' , `` the texas chainsaw massacre part <NUM> '' , `` shogun assassin '' , `` rabid grannies '' , `` ichi the killer '' , `` tromeo and juliet '' , `` terror firmer '' , `` ninja scroll '' , `` robocop '' , `` nightmare on elm street '' , `` high tension '' , `` friday the 13th series '' , `` freddy vs. jason '' , `` leon the professional '' , `` sin city '' , `` last house on the left '' , `` blood diner '' , `` basket case '' , `` house of <NUM> corpses '' , `` the devil 's rejects '' , `` luthor the geek '' , `` pieces '' , `` jungle holocaust '' , `` troma 's war '' , `` combat shock '' , `` fist of the north star ( anime ) '' , `` uncle sam '' , `` natural born killers '' , `` versus '' , `` driller killer '' , `` contamination '' , `` taxi driver '' , `` stacy '' , `` house of wax ( <NUM> ) '' , `` candyman '' , `` wolf creek '' , `` cannibal apocalypse '' , `` bad taste '' , `` meet the feebles '' , `` pink flamingos '' , `` reservoir dogs '' , `` bride of re-animator '' , `` beyond re-animator '' , `` battle royale '' , `` phenomena '' , `` men behind the sun '' , `` bloody birthday '' , `` demons '' , `` blade ii '' , `` final destination trilogy '' and `` cannibal holocaust ''

i 'm writing this review to respond to a reviewer 's frustrations that the liner notes he received were those belonging to the `` sweet dreams '' album . this happened to me as well when i bought the cd from borders . so , i got a refund for it , bought a copy from barnes and noble , and the same thing happened . finally , i took my money to best buy , and found the correct liner notes ! so , the barnes and noble/best buy shipments must have been faulty . for those interested in purchasing the album , i found it quite enjoyable . i 'm too young to have had the original lps , so any bonus tracks released were nice to have . i found the photos intriguing as well , once i had the correct booklet ! in my opinion though , it was worth the effort to have the correct liner notes
if you are a fan of bonobo 's work , you will definitely love this album . recurring is mindblowing and is my favorite off this ep . listen to the sample of recurring on amazon and be blown away . if it does n't make you want to buy the album , you are not a fan of bonobo . buy this album now

... while we keep hearing the same all tracks every other dj/producer is mixing , sasha comes with a totally different sound that keeps evolving . ca n't wait for his next one , awesome .
after reading a lot of reviews , i decided to give this dvd a chance . it was the first dance workout dvd that i purchased and i 'm really having a hard time finding another one that is as much fun . ( i just ordered her african/latin one and hope it 's as good ! ) the biggest plus is that it keeps me interested and going back for more . i do this workout at least twice a week and find myself feeling like i actually exercised without trying . i hate to exercise , so it 's definitely a selling factor that i actually look forward to doing this . if you are n't a dancer , it will be a smidgen difficult at first , but you know that if you keep doing it that you 'll catch on . it 's not as hopeless as some of the other ones that i bought .... and helped me discover that i 've got no future in hip-hop ! madonna has a good personality and teaches you without you even knowing that you 're learning choreography . i learned some fun moves and my teenage relatives gave me `` cool points '' when i pulled out the routine while we were dancing around the livingroom : - ) i would definitely recommend this dvd
i have to admit rifkin 's version of the b minor mass , although shocked me a bit at first , managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory . the point is that in bach 's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments . so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists . with this in mind , rifkin 's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship . the sounds are crisp , the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect . i got this cd after being convinced by the mass in b minor . highly recommended
how could i have missed hunwick until now ? he is a rabbit-eared bandicoot , one of an endangered species , familiarly known in australia as the bilby . * aussie * reviewer `` lin '' won me over by suggesting that `` hunwick 's egg '' would be a great easter gift . hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch . they are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug : a cockatoo , an echidna ( resembling a porcupine ) , and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of * bryll cream * . . . hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen ! but still the egg does not hatch . the plant life is gorgeous , drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils . i am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus , and other green wildflowers . after referring to my dictionary i felt tricked into falling for a rat , of all things . i do n't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature ! the more important reality is that happiness can erupt from the most unexpected of relationships . it is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow . reviewer mchaiku recommends that you make sure you have an easter basket large enough to accommodate this precious book
this is a great book for anyone who wants to enhance their walk with christ . if you want to study deeper , there is a study guide that goes with this book . great for small group discussions
first issued in <NUM> , this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of chicago 's architecture that has been destroyed ( by nature and man ) . today chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel ( and it is , i live there ! ) but after reading this book you wo n't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the urban renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened . if you are interested in architecture , chicago history or urban design and planning , read this book
i 'd seen the movie `` valley of the dolls , '' whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book , but only recently did i read jacqueline susann 's magnum opus . what a pleasant surprise ! this engaging novel , despite its length , is a fast read . it is better -- far better -- than the film . ( the movie , however , is a `` must see '' for its over-the-top acting , <NUM> 's fashions and `` so bad it 's good '' storyline . ) although initially billed ( to great effect ) as a steamy romance novel , the book is much more substantive . each of the characters is well-developed , and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing . before it was fashionable , susann used the character of anne welles to explore one woman 's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career . susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon . neely o'hara is initially a sympathetic character , but has enough of the `` bitter greens '' ( envy , jealousy and bile ) which , when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills , leads to her rise and fall . and jennifer north knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations . these characters are real , and one need not be in show business to know them . although written in <NUM> ( with a story that begins in <NUM> ) , the plotline is not dated . neither is the message : susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness . there is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers .

i guess i am jaded because i watched the imax everest video ( which seems to get the best reviews ) first and ca n't help but compare them . still this video had some good participants i.e . ed viestur 's and such . interesting view point but the testing did n't do much for me but provide information . would have liked more extra 's on dvd to . all in all ok .
being a big fan of horror and scray movies i consider this movie to be a success . as it succeeded in doing what it intended , it scared the crap out of me . i would say it is one of the scariest movies i have ever seen , those japanese sure know how to scare people . the storyline is actually quite good too , and while the acting is n't quite inspirational , it is quite good by all involved . the movie making is of a high quality and all up , this is a very good movie , well worth buying and watching over again
anyone interested in the way a cold-blooded killer 's mind works will be fascinated by this dvd . i got shivers watching it . product arrived in mint condition and before the seller stated it would . i would definitely buy again from this seller

this is one of my favorite eastwood movies and what clint said is the perfect western . in typical stoic fashion eastwood outsmarts , outshoots and out-cools the badguys at every turn . i put this one somewhere just below the good the bad and the ugly , but higher than eastwoods recent work like unforgiven where he seems to have lost his moral compass and confidence
i found this book to be very well written and easy to understand , for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character ( using 3ds max <NUM> ) . if you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject . on the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and does n't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters . but all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design

i read this book some time ago . it is one of the most fascinating books i 've ever read . eric haney is one of the most fascinating people i 've ever met . a very confident but unassuming person , that once you meet you realize he has no need to embellish his life 's in delta story with accounts based in fantasy . eric haney is the real deal and a genuine person . eric is a true leader and a brilliant man . i am absolutely appalled at some of the claims made about eric being less than honest in his book . what a shame that such a good american has to be trodden over by cheap and meaningless gossip . jealousy is a terrible thing . by the way , i believe much of the gossip is fueled by eric haney 's comments about the iraq war being a debacle . you simply ca n't go unscathed when you refuse to worship at the foot of the golden calf of the george w. bush iraq war . great book ! ! ! great american ! ! ! gary mcclaran b'ham , a
its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a <NUM> star average . this is quality thrash metal right here , with a slightly refined sound to it . all the songs have blistering solos , crazy as hell riffs , and of course , paul bostaphs inhuman drumming , which brings me to another a point . paul bostaph is just as good as dave lombardo you f-ing retards ! ! ! ! ! ! get it through your f-ing skulls . sorry , i had to get that out . but seriously , just listen to the crazy intro to killing fields , his crazy pummeling in dittohead , and his double bass madness in ss-3 . this is slayer , quality slayer , and all the b-chin needs to stop . im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it , like the retards reviewing trivium and unearth . if your like those sepultura and anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s , than so be it . your loss . as for me , my favorite tracks are killing fields , ss-3 , mind control , <NUM> , and dittohead . if my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change , get diabolus in musica , this , and god hates us all . also get some of pauls work with exodus , forbidden , and testament if you need further proof of his excellency
from the remarkable book structuring ( the `` chapters '' are organized in alphabetical order ) to the intriguingly insightful commentary , seth godin has once again created a work of excellence . the book is an easy read , but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of `` oh my , i need to fix that , or do that , or change that . '' i found the chapter on `` clean fire trucks '' particularly interesting , as i had just <NUM> months earlier finished an innovation article on `` retiring the fire trucks '' -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place ! ( as such , you can then have time to clean the fire trucks , or as i put it , to retire them altogether ! ) . his rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious ( hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really should n't be doing ) . take for example his rant on `` wrappers '' and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived , received , and applied . one might say , `` it 's the wrapper , stupid . '' once again , mr. godin has helped to `` validate my existence '' ( despite my intense self-certainty ! ) by showing that the crazy , `` outside the box '' ( hey , can we just shred the box , then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them ? ) , simplifying , forward-looking , remarkable , visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort . in short , less is more , small is big , and remarkable is just that : remarkable . this book is remarkable . i strongly encourage adding it to your shelf , then spreading the virus of its contents to others . p.s . the entire ending `` bonus section '' on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed , and single-handedly justifies the purchase

if you are a fan of early scifi movies , this is a must-have for your library . there are some classic shot sequences that have been honored in more recent films , and you should look for these . for example , spielberg must be a big fan . pay attention to the shot compositions for the field ( fence , lighting , etc . ) and seek out homages to be found in close encounters and war of the worlds . it is also highly informative to note the perspectives used for social mores , and for science in general . in today 's world , the notion that `` the town scientist '' would turn his astonomical telescope into the daylight sky and view heavenly objects , then turn it below the horizontal and look across the countryside to view the goings on at a top secret military base , are both hoots . that the scientist sees a classic rocketship and knows simply by the form that it is `` atomic '' , is classic . one can only imagine the wonder that science and the future held for the popular mind back then that the writers could get away with that kind of stuff . and yet , in contrast , note the strong presentation of the female role , not as a nurse , but as a doctor who makes the initial tough decisions and takes charge of the situation , driving the story forward . very progressive , when contrasted with the `` scientist love interest who exists to admire the brilliance , bravery and manhood of the hero '' found in the typical films of this genre and era . admittedly , our heroine is subjected to those stereotypes later on in the story , which is disappointing . i also love the military response . this is shortly after wwii . because some kid has a bug up his tail , we roll the tanks onto the trains and storm the town . commanding officers up on rooftops with binoculars ! ! in summary , our modern levels of sophistication might diminish this film to mystery science theater , but that would be unfair . instead , i recommend watching it once for the sheer joy of it . then , watch it a second time with a more critical eye and have all your laughs and pick out all your iconic scenes for future reference

if you are newer to bach 's abundent solo keyboard music - or angela hewitt - then this cd is an excellent place to start . it features the popular `` french overture '' and contains some of the more lyrical and `` accessible '' music bach wrote for the keyboard . there is a delightful mix of bach compositions here capturing the diverse musical styles from italy , france , germany and spain . bach shows himself to be a true `` non-politico '' as well as the master composer by skillfully combining these styles ( namely from france and italy ) to produce works of great appeal and mastery - but in a style that is uniquely `` bach . '' in the opening piece , hewitt does great justice to bach 's tribute to the italian concerto style with a convincing `` dialog '' between lighter solo episodes ( tutti ) and the fuller passages imitating orchestral effect ( ritornello ) - all on one keyboar of course . this piece is most famous for the adagio which hewitt infuses with much heart and soul by her delicate , thoughtful melodic lines that never approach over sentimentality . the main event of this cd must certainly be the monumental `` french overture '' ( aka : partita in b minor ) - a grand conception lasting some <NUM> minutes repleat with numerous movements of french courtly dance influence and rich in imaginative and decorative keyboard effects . miss hewitt wonderfully articulates these effervescent rhythms with supreme confidence and masterful result . her ornamentations are always tasteful , seamlessly integrated and truly enthralling to hear . in the off-beat rhythms of the gigue , her semiquavers bounce off the page with great poise and the crispness of fresh-pressed linen . and she shows her masterful pianism to its fullest in the curious final `` echo '' movement , bringing an brilliant , orchestral quality to it . hiding in the shadows of these two main events are four charming little `` duets . '' these are no mere `` fillers '' but delightfully catchy , two-part inventions that hewitt plays to full effect . rounding out the program is a most unique `` program music '' piece by bach thought written around the story of his older brother 's departure ( `` capriccio on departure of his brother '' ) . in it , angela hewitt communicates both its nostalgic sentiments with her gentle , poinant phrasing and dynamics along with the piece 's festive celebratory ending with her effective creation of trumpet and horn effects . in this unique composition , hewitt succeeds to create a wonderful range of emotive effects in one piece . indeed , her carefree yet tight-on-the-rails style truly seems to bring out the best of bach 's keyboard treasures - transforming them into music of great vitality and charm . her approach to bach is one of artistry , nuance and good taste ( not unlike schiff ) but without the `` directness '' or the `` rough edges '' that can be found in other performer 's approaches ( gould and gulda , respectfully ) . the many great bach performers through the last decades have given us many `` pallates of color '' to experience , and hewitt 's colors are most notably beauty of tone , a poetic flavor , and graceful fluidity of line at its heart . it is no wonder that angela hewitt has been heralded as `` the premier bach pianist of this generation . '' just about any recording of bach 's keyboard music by angela hewitt is a safe bet for being among the top choices available , and this cd is certainly no exception . it received the highest marks from both gramaphone and penguin guides while classicstoday gave it a perfect 10/10 for artisty/sound quality . in all her bach recordings from hyperion , the sound quality of this recording is among the fullest and most realistically recorded ( where some other recordings like her couperin , wtc or french suites are done with a touch more `` spaciousness '' but still with clarity ) . also a highlight are the scholarly and detailed notes delineating the nuances of the various `` dance '' types that bach encorporated into his compositions . in all , an emmensely satisfying recording from a top bach pianist of our time . highly recommended
for all the fans of the original broadway musical soundtrack of `` dreamgirls , '' their dreams have come true with this 25th-year anniversary special edition cd . included are all the original tracks from the dreamgirls soundtrack and three previously unreleased recordings of `` driving down the strip '' `` it 's all over '' and a reprise of the title track `` dreamgirls '' for the finale . a second cd has instrumental versions of some of the stand out tracks including `` and i am telling you i 'm not going '' and `` one night only . '' the album has been remastered and it does sound louder with more bass than the original , but there are some instances where jennifer holliday 's voice begins to blare . that 's probably due to the fact that holliday is such a powerful singer and the decibel levels went into the red when they were recording the original master tapes , so it ca n't be helped . however , the added tracks sound very crisp and clear . also included in this special edition cd is a booklet containing an intro by henry krieger ( song writer for additional music in the motion picture dreamgirls ) , the original liner notes with photos from the stage production , and lyrics to all the songs . i would have given this set five stars but the song `` heavy '' is n't on here , neither is the disco version of `` one night only . '' from what i understand , we 're lucky to get the three previously unreleased tracks ! legend has it that geffen did not want to produce a double length album with three virtually unknown singers , which explains the omission of some songs and the remixing of two different versions of `` one night only '' down to one track . also , he wanted the best possible sound quality for the original album . the inlcusion of `` it 's all over '' is well worth the price of this cd . the climactic show-down between the three girls , the replacement , and the boss brings a new perspective to the show stopping song `` and i 'm telling you ... '' one more thing , there seems to be some confusion between this cd and the one coming out for the motion picture `` dreamgirls . '' this is the original broadway recording of the musical . beyonce and jenifer hudson are not on this cd . but jennifer holliday , sheryl lee ralph and loretta devine shine as the original dreams
tabitha , athena , and lavonn , i 'll leave all of my women for you three . let 's talk music , surrender , i like , keep on , giving you my love again , and the songs with keith sweat sound great . these ladies were in the range of groups like swv and jade . that 's a good class to be in .
another great concert put out by kylie . she covers a little bit of everything from her career . the only complaint i may have is that there was a spot where the concert drug . too bad that the fans in the u.s. have been deprived by her talent all these years . i wish that she would put out a dvd with all of her videos , something like the ultimate kylie she released last year . i hope she keeps it going for years to come
playing time - 39:05 -- don rigsby does n't even turn the big 4-0 until february <NUM> of <NUM> . already he has two decades of professional bluegrass experience with such top groups as longview , bluegrass cardinals , j.d . crowe & the new south , lonesome river band and rock country . he 's also released four highly-acclaimed solo albums and was twice named spbgma 's male vocalist for the year . when rock country disbanded , don was faced with two choices - work for someone else , or form his own band . he chose the latter and , unlike previous solo albums from rigsby ( on the sugar hill label ) that enlisted friends and session players , he has recorded `` hillbilly heartache '' with his own group ( midnight call ) that includes himself singing lead and playing mandolin , along with dale vanderpool ( banjo ) , shayne bartley ( guitar ) , jesse wells ( fiddle ) , and robert maynard ( bass ) . it was a good move to do it all themselves this time because it 's a crackerjack band . in a few instances , ( make god laugh , red bird , prisoner on the highway ) , their vocal arrangements also call for rigsby to jump up to tenor on the choruses . `` he loves to hear you shout '' ( written by dixie and tom t. hall ) is a very nicely presented vocal quartet for the group with rigsby , vanderpool , bartley and wells doing the vocalizing . while best known for his mandolin picking , don 's a versatile multi-instrumentalist , and it 's a treat to hear him also provide some snippets of guitar , mandele , and fiddle . two songs ( `` these golden fields '' and `` any bar in birmingham '' ) incorporate some of don 's light percussion . the former , about farming , features don 's high-lead singing with two harmonies below , as well as wells ' octave violin for a different mood . obviously , quite a bit of forethought went into producing these songs in the best possible manner for us . in a few , the banjo is muted , and on the closing number , `` i am the man , thomas '' ) jesse wells lays down his fiddle to provide clawhammer banjo as the only accompaniment for don 's voice . midnight call 's repertoire is drawn from some excellent songwriters ( shawn camp , marty rabon , jim lauderdale , mark brinkman , larry shell , kim williams , tim stafford , and others ) . bobby cyrus is a co-writer of `` big jim . '' i 'm curious as to whether big jim is a fictional folkloric character or whether there was actually a man who sacrificed himself for others . you may recall that it was cyrus who penned the reflective `` carved our names in stone '' that was sung solo by rigsby on his last solo album , the midnight call . farmers , family , life and love get ample coverage in the songs . for his song of home , he belts out an inspired rendition of bill monroe 's `` kentucky waltz . '' another tale from that region is an intoxicating `` daddy was a moonshine man . '' a standard instrumental , `` forked deer '' gallops along , but i hope their future projects introduce us to new tunes . sung solo , `` old green chevrolet '' relates a tale of a traveling preacher bringing the gospel to mountain folks , and i missed a little harmony on the choruses . with `` hillbilly heartache , '' evocative messages get us thinking , smiling , contemplating , and even laughing when the intoxicating `` daddy was a moonshine man '' cues up . this kentuckian clearly has strong mountain roots , and he knows what it takes to produce a very compelling bluegrass album . his reputation and dedication to traditional music , and his innovative vision for the future , are well documented . while he may have stretched boundaries a bit in the past , `` hillbilly heartache '' is simply a hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass .

wow ! as a new admirer of michael 's , ( within the last <NUM> years or so ) i must admit that i 've been missing out on a lot . abandon garden just happens to be my favorite album of his , as well as one of my & quot ; all time <NUM> best albums & quot ; . i remember hearing some of his works when i was younger and thinking he was the voice behind & quot ; kermit the frog & quot ; . i had a chance to see him in concert once ( capital jazz fest , coulmbia , md july'98 ) and was absolutely enthralled . i have the complete collection of his works and i often play it for friends and co-workers . easily , abandoned garden is the favorite amongst them . even my non-jazz enthusiast friends seem to love the album . my favorite song is & quot ; a fools errand & quot ; . now have n't we all played that role before
this book was a real eye opener . after reading this book i am much more knowledgable about the foods available in the market and i am able to make better and healthier choices . my overall health has improved and i feel i have more energy than before . i would definitely recommend this book to anyone
if only washington could embrace the ideas laid out in this book . i think newt would make a fresh and bright addition to the mccain administration . perhaps even vp . newt does have everything one needs to be the president , however not in <NUM> . the conditions disallow the risk of running anything but a sure thing to stave off the potential nightmare that both hillary or al gore represent . but newt 's knowledge and wisdom will flow freely throughout the coming political process and his message will be heard . bravo
all the lives of the saints are great , which is what makes it difficult to rate movies of their lives . you would think that the movie would naturally deserve five stars , but that is n't always the case . in rating a movie on the life of a saint , what is really being rated is the presentation of their life . this presentation of the life of st. francis of assisi is deserving of five stars because it shows the viewer how st. francis embodied true conversion , faith , hope , and love . despite this , however , i do have this criticism : the heart of st. francis ' spiritual life was the eucharistic sacrifice of the mass . shockingly , however , the movie does not portray this at all ! this criticism also applies to the recent movie on the life of st. anthony of padua , which i would likewise give five stars . these two saints wold sometimes live only off of the `` food which endures to eternal life '' ( jn 6:27 ) ! yet one wold not at all get this from the movies . this is a major disappointment . nevertheless , though , the movie still deserves five stars , for without the gifts of repentance , faith , hope , and love , the eucharist would be received in vain
after sampling this new shanachie product `` when gospel was gospel '' , i can testify that this is african-american singing to the `` nth '' power . this style of `` full-throated '' singing is seldom heard anymore because african-americans either prospered after the civil rights movement or fell to the seductive power of `` hip hop '' genre that captured the heart , mind and spirit as classical gospel once did . this music started in the <NUM> 's when african-americans were in their `` great depression '' . and african-americans have a ph.d in suffering and hard times . this music is a testament to our ability to `` ground '' ourselves in a strange land of north america and plant our beliefs , hopes , and aspirations in a musical form . i am always impressed with these singers who have went to heaven . each one has something to offer new generations of singers in tone , drama , and breadth of personality . i recommend this cd to those who are struggling to find meaning in their lives . those who are looking for excitement and surprise . african-americans know about the negativities of life and we know how to create `` joy that comes to our mornings '' rev . khalil canady m.div age <NUM>
brilliant , hilarious , and fun to listen . i think that `` you 'll have time '' is one of my favorite songs of all time . who ever would have guessed that about an album by ... william shatner ? he has a fine sense of self-parody , and the album is very well produced . william shatner , you are so cool
this is an amazing book i recommend anyone from any culture . it 's not a book that tells you dos and dons , rather a journey of an american pastor who was preaching about marriage , sex , love and god in africa . i am especially impressed towards the end of the book when the good christian african man , maurice , asked weather if he was wrong as a <NUM> year old virgin to dumb his ex girl-friend because she was not a virgin . good for maurice to stand firm before god against temptation . but there are too many maurice , justifying women who have a different path of life , which might be so wrong , but in needed for forgiveness and acceptance . the books raises a lot of tough and true questions , which sometimes is hard for us to even form . for me , it was tough for me to explain to my boy friend why i think it is problematic for him to not think about marriage , and keep saying that he will seek god first . it 's contradictory . do you not love a child because you want to love god first ? both can come as a practice . practice how to love god and humble ourselves in marriage . to serve one another , the best way to display our love for god . in the book , another character , fatma , a beautiful young women , just like the samaritan woman who met jesus on the way to the well written in the new testament . she and her <NUM> ex bf/husband , and still living with another man , non of them is her husband . this beautiful woman could not see a way out , do not find a place in god even though she was searching . this story of fatma is also true to many women who became a christian later in her life or was lost on the way as a christian . how women like that may think the best way out is to commit suicide , because her body and soul are wounded , so wounded and dirty , that , abandoning it is the only way out . this is the best book so far i have read about sex , forgiveness , marriage , love and god . it 's not a self help book , but i would recommend to anyone in any age .
this book will strike you as weird in the first few chapters and then it will start to make sense and really grab your attention . nora mixes sorcery , vampires , witches , battles , and romance into present day occurrences and diversity . marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
very good , but do n't expect the movie . quite a few changes .
you 'll probably recognize grazing in the grass as the backround music from that tv commercial with the chinese-american lady from the view . i forget whether its for khakis or golf , and i most certainly do n't watch the view , but this is great music . - - you might remember issac hayes making fun of the million mile an hour & quot ; i can dig it & quot ; conjugations in & quot ; i 'm gon na get you sucka & quot ; - -my point is , they 're songs like kung fu fighting and a lot of tunes in those gap commercials ... you may not have actually bought the album or even know the words ( personally , i have a sealed copy of kung fu ) , but if you 're a certain age , you you 're bound to remember them or perk up when you hear them . i tend to think of this group as kind of a slightly more soulful take off on the fifth dimension . when i 'm in the mood i like both groups . they are cheery yet soulful at the same time . while grazing was their big hit , i 'd have to say the winner for me is love or let me be lonely ... especially the way it starts out all slow and dramatic then goes into that brassy uptempo part . - - anyway , these songs make great listening ( and sometimes backround music ) for the key of life . for sure they were definitely the & quot ; have a nice day/ * smile * & quot ; side of the '70s . i would definitely reccomend exploring them
funk , in its purest form , is hard to come by these days . that 's because we do n't have the kind of wreckless visionaries that the 70s had , like dr. john and george clinton . these guys were so far gone into their music that they bordered on being parodies of themselves , and somehow that translated into the kind of raw and unprecedented energy that makes their music so saturated in what one would ideally define as 'funky ' . take dr. john : the dude is basically the white george clinton , with his crazy head dresses and honky tonk muppet voice . put him in front of a piano , get the meters to lay down the tightest funk grooves you 've ever heard , and add producer alain toussaint 's canjun roots and you 've got an exceptionally enjoyable album in `` in the right place '' . the music is uplifting and listenable ; the meters take the house down with some thick bass riffs , brilliantly arranged horns and tight-as-hell percussions . dr. john wails like a drunken canjun cartoon character , which is such an endearing and appropriate compliment to this musical experience that you will not know how to listen to this kind of funk without a voice as original and funky as this . while the entire album provides a consistent line-up of quality jams , the two stand-outs that have become two of dr. john 's greatest hits are `` right place , wrong time '' and `` such a night '' . `` right place , wrong time '' would fill any dance floor with its danceability factor , while `` such a night '' is a kind of honky tonk interpretation of a faster-paced soul ballad , with great backing vocals and a nostalgic , bugsy malone-sounding keys section . this album is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the funk . dr. john is a true pioneer in the genre and , while most of his work is worth owning , this is nonetheless one of his best albums to prove it
i love this video because my 3.5 year old learned his letters ( both upper and lower-case ) in a week . sadly , he did not have much exposure to the alphabet prior to this video so we were extremely happy with how quickly he learned . i thought he would get bored with it because it 's very repetitious ( eg . the letter ' a ' is repeated several times with the image flashing in different positions ) but they do use that same letter ' a ' as a cute character ( a rocket that takes off into the sky while saying ' a ' ) which my child loves . each letter ( both upper and lower-case ) has a different character ( although the upper and lower-case of each letter is similar - for example , letter ' a ' and ' a ' are both rockets in different environments ) . the kids voices used for the characters are also endearing to hear over-and-over ... which we do watch over-and-over-and-over at my oldest son 's request . ( my <NUM> mo old son loves this video also !
this is probably the best of the spongebob cd 's released to date . it has a cute radio-station theme that is woven in between the songs . though the first few songs are just repeats of previous albums , there are a number of great new songs . so the cd is worth the money . parents be aware that there are two songs that deal with `` mature '' subjects in a childish way ( dealing with underwear and saying bad words ) . overall a fun album
the book i am reviewing is the van gough caf√© by cynthia rylant . i think book is great because it 's so imaginative . this book is about a cafe where things happen . there really is no problem in this story . it is more about everything magical that happened in the cafe . i would recommend this book to everyone in my reading class . another book cynthia rylant wrote is wedding flowers . this story deserves five stars ! emerson , nj ; fifth grade studen
& quot ; the kinks are the village green preservation society & quot ; appeared and disappeared with nary a trace when it was first released in <NUM> . overshadowed by & quot ; the white album & quot ; ( the beatles ) , beggar 's banquet ( the stones ) and other major releases , it seemed horribly out of step with its time when it was first released . that 's because , as was often the case with the kinks , it was . & quot ; village green & quot ; preceded the move back to the pastoral sounds and eagerness to recapture the innocence of the past by about twenty years . it sounds surprisingly fresh and vital now even if some the production occasionally sounds dated . that only adds to its charm . now expanded to fill three cds ( as it should have been when castle/essential remastered and re-released the album a couple of years ago ) , & quot ; village green & quot ; has never sounded so great and so complete . while it has a few glaring omissions ( most notably & quot ; she 's got everything & quot ; which davies did n't really want on this album along with a couple of other tracks that were originally slated for but withdrawn from the finished line up ) , this is about as complete a representation as were going to get of the material recorded during the 1966-1968 time frame when & quot ; village green & quot ; was recorded . lovingly restored and remastered under the supervision of andrew sandoval ( how does andy get all these great jobs ? ) with remastering done by the magical bill inglot and dan hirsch at digiprep , & quot ; village green & quot ; sparkles and sounds the best it ever has on cd . disc one focuses on the original stereo version of the album . a better sounding version of this edition has never appeared before ( although the japanese k2 remaster sounded pretty darn close ) . we also get bonus tracks featuring a single a side from the time & quot ; days & quot ; and the stereo alternate mixes that appeared on the withdrawn <NUM> track edition of & quot ; village green & quot ; . we & quot ; mr. songbird & quot ; ( stereo version ) as well . disc two features the mono version of the album . since the mixes differ slightly , hardcore kinks fans will want both versions . on the mono version we also get bonus tracks as well including the mono version of & quot ; mr. songbird & quot ; , & quot ; polly & quot ; , & quot ; wonderboy & quot ; , & quot ; berkeley mews & quot ; and a no strings version ( the earliest from <NUM> ) of & quot ; village green & quot ; to close out the cd . disc three is the one that will have fans salivating . the & quot ; rarities & quot ; disc as it 's subtitled features a number of tracks previously unavailable ( offically and unoffically ) on cd plus tracks that have never been released . we get the following stereo & quot ; rarities & quot ; ; & quot ; misty water & quot ; ( and also the mono version which has n't been released before ) , & quot ; berkeley mews & quot ; , & quot ; easy come ( previously unreleased on cd ) , there you went & quot ; , & quot ; polly & quot ; , & quot ; animal farm & quot ; ( alternate stereo mix previously unreleased ) , & quot ; johnny thunder & quot ; ( an alternate stereo remix ) , & quot ; did you see his name & quot ; , & quot ; mick avory 's underpants & quot ; ( an instrumental previously unreleased ) , & quot ; lavender hill & quot ; , & quot ; rosemary rose & quot ; , & quot ; wonderboy & quot ; , & quot ; spotty grotty anna & quot ; , & quot ; where did my spring go ? & quot ; , & quot ; groovy movies & quot ; , & quot ; creeping jean & quot ; ( and unreleased longer , stereo mix ) , & quot ; king kong & quot ; . we also get the following mono tracks including & quot ; misty water & quot ; , & quot ; do you remember walter & quot ; ( a bbc session remix ) , & quot ; animal farm ( a bbc sesion remix ) , & quot ; days & quot ; ( a bbc session remix ) and & quot ; phenomenal cat & quot ; ( a mono instrumental mix ) . a note on the & quot ; rarities & quot ; -- many of these were previously available on & quot ; the great lost kinks album & quot ; and on bootlegs but never with sound this good . also , the bbc sessions are , like many from the time , the instrumental backing with some new vocals dubbed on . they do n't sound significantly different from the original versions but collectors will want them . the deluxe packaging features a booklet with new comments from ray , dave , pete and mick on the making of the album and various tracks . we also get a discussion on the genesis and difficulties that the album faced . sandoval also co-authors a brief synposis with info drawn from doug hinman 's excellent book on the kinks that discusses when the various recordings were made , differences between them and the process of putting together the album . & quot ; village green & quot ; is presented in a deluxe digipak accordian fold out sleeve . sure , it 's missing a few key album tracks but , really , this is as good as it gets when dealing with the corporate world and the compromises of reissuing classic albums .
i have n't seen this movie and i 've never heard of it . the cover makes it look so interesting that i ca n't wait to see it . i highly recommend this movie to everybody
jim carrey is so very near his best ! or best this movie made me laugh ! so much ! the story plot was very well done . supporting cast was also very good . best scene , was when he got pulled over while speeding , and showed all his tickets . had me dying jubril [ ... ] teenage business pheno

i was absolutely , hopelessly hooked on csi from the first time i watched it . i started with season <NUM> ( never saw it on t.v. , just started watching the dvds ) and am now on season three . this has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the csis is amazing , the story lines are fresh , and it has quickly become my favorite drama ( with <NUM> being a very close second ) . only one thing about the other reviews -- yes , nick 's character is gorgeous , but how about that warrick ? he 's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous , but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face , body -- everything . grissom is also attractive because he 's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything . sara has a great voice , and well i could say something great about all of the character 's physical qualities , but the most important thing is that the show is captivating , innovative , and fresh . season after season , you 're drawn into each and every story line . i love csi and hope it stays on the air for another <NUM> years
this is the true story of teena brandon ( hillary swank ) , a lonely teenage girl living as a man , `` brandon teena . '' she 's been in trouble with the law and has no roots . when she comes to a new town , she is befriended by a `` family '' of perpetually drunk low-lifes , and is especially attracted to lana ( chloe sevigny ) , who dreams of going to memphis and being a karaoke singer . brandon and chloe fall in love , angering two men who begin to suspect brandon 's true identity . swank 's performance as brandon/teena is simply remarkable . she conveys the heartbreak and misery of an outsider , a misfit , and the need for love that is universal ; she won the oscar in <NUM> for this role . sevigny is convincing as the girl who falls in love with both brandon and teena . despite its low-budget ( swank earned only $ 3,000 ) , this is an extremely well-made , thought-provoking , and deeply moving for adults . ( there are sexual and extremely violent scenes . ) a riveting , shocking , and very sad story with sensitive acting and direction
the only e. l. doctorow book i ever read was `` ragtime , '' and i read it because i enjoyed milos foreman 's film version . i was n't impressed with the novel . the author 's writing style was excruciating -- on purpose or unintentional , i do n't know -- in a way that reminds one of theodore dreiser . moreover , i continually found myself sighing heavily over the book 's anachronisms . sorry , but the early twentieth century was not the 1960s ! quit trying to rewrite history ! doctorow did do a few things right , however . his characters , at least a few of them , were interesting . too , i liked how he integrated their tales with real life historical figures and events . so when i recently learned that foreman 's version of the book came out on dvd , i decided to rewatch the film . the director , who made `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' in <NUM> , went on to lens several other memorable films , including `` amadeus , '' `` the people vs. larry flynt , '' and `` man on the moon . '' if you 're familiar with any of these movies , it 's obvious milos foreman likes using his camera to document kooky characters . `` ragtime '' provides him with plenty of opportunities to examine oddball personalities engaging in often oddball behavior . those crazy gilded age americans ! several major and minor stories wend their way through `` ragtime . '' we follow a well to do new york family -- consisting of `` father '' ( james olson ) , `` mother '' ( mary steenburgen ) , and mother 's `` younger brother '' ( brad dourif ) -- that seems to represent the wasp majority . the family becomes embroiled in a pregnancy scandal involving a black woman named sarah ( debbie allen ) and her lover coalhouse walker jr. ( howard e. rollins jr. ) . while walker attempts to ingratiate himself with our wasp family in an effort to win over sarah , he becomes involved in a minor scandal when a group of firemen led by willie conklin ( kenneth mcmillan ) vandalizes his automobile . other threads focus on a poor jewish artist named tateh ( mandy patinkin ) , whose invention of a nifty little gimcrack called `` picture books '' leads to a career as one of hollywood 's first film directors . a notorious murder case also takes center stage from time to time . when renowned architect stanford white ( norman mailer ) starts fooling around with airheaded evelyn nesbit ( elizabeth mcgovern ) , her jealous lover harry k. thaw ( robert joy ) pops a couple of caps in white 's noggin -- in full view of hundreds of witnesses . as you can see , `` ragtime '' covers an enormous amount of material . remarkably , the movie works quite well . the first part spends all of its time establishing the story lines and fleshing out the characters . the second part focuses largely on coalhouse walker 's failures to achieve justice for the wrongs done to him . he eventually turns into a terrorist who , with the help of a few friends , bombs several firehouses around town . then he seizes a library in new york city , wires it with explosives , and threatens to blow the place sky high if he does n't receive a new car to replace the damaged vehicle . let 's see -- what else happens ? well , younger brother strikes up an affair with evelyn nesbit only to discover she 's a total ditz that flits from man to man in search of easy money . disenchanted with his failed relationship , younger brother falls in with decidedly unwholesome elements that -- surprise -- play a big part in the film 's most important segment . mother and father drift apart over a number of issues , not the least of which involves sarah 's baby but also father 's stuffiness when it comes to progressive issues like feminism and race . booker t. washington ( moses gunn ) and harry houdini ( jeffrey demunn ) also pop in from time to time , although the former plays a bigger part in the proceedings . man , is this a tough film to summarize ! foreman and company pack a ton of stuff in two and a half hours and still fail to incorporate everything doctorow put in his book . oh well . only a television miniseries could hope to achieve a faithful adaptation , and even then it would n't work considering the very adult material doctorow placed in certain segments of his story . i think the best way to view the film is as a well-done period piece populated with a stellar cast . the costumes and the set pieces look great , from the glittery buildings populated by the elites to the dirty tenement houses where tateh plies his trade . performances are sublime . watching jimmy cagney play a tough as nails police commissioner is wonderful , especially when you consider he had n't appeared in a movie since <NUM> . donald o'connor , pat o'brien , jeff daniels , and even jack nicholson turn up as well in smaller roles . the late kenneth mcmillan , a personal favorite of mine , deserves special mention for playing a racist scumbag that you 'll love to hate . throw in an amazing score from none other than randy newman , and the result is an extremely entertaining film that holds your attention for <NUM> minutes . extras on the disc include a commentary track with milos foreman and producer michael houseman , a lengthy deleted scene involving mcgovern 's character meeting anarchist emma goldman , and a featurette on the making of the film . my only real problem with `` ragtime '' the motion picture concerns the anachronistic attitudes on race . i highly doubt the police would take the word of a black man over a white firefighter back in the 1910s , nor would there be as much sympathy as there is for sarah 's plight . that 's the 1960s talking . anyway , the film is a winner for the reasons i stated above . i also should mention that any movie that shows all around jerk and agitator norman mailer taking a bullet in the head gets my vote any day !
this is one of the shows i watched when i was younger , its so good to be able to see them again , the bad thing is that it doesnt come with spanish audio
this dvd is hot from the good girl to the bad this is it
i especially liked seeing the `` legends of batman '' episode that brings to life the old batman style of the <NUM> & 50s . it was a lot of fun to watch
it is truly astonishing how many competent mds treating acid reflux do n't warn their patients of the dietary restrictions facing those who suffer from acid reflex . this applies not only to family doctors but incredibly ents ! as such , patients are strongly advised to `` understand their own bodies . '' all our bodies are different . some patients will have strong negative reactions to chocolate . others to orange juice . some to red wine . some to apple juice . to fix acid reflux problems - and it is almost always fixable - it is critical to understand what particular foods and beverages are causing it . this book will help properly identify .
even if you have other eclipse books at home , totality provides fresh information about this fascinating phenomenon . this book describes in clear language what makes a total solar eclipse so special . the authors explanation of the science behind eclipses helps to demystify the eclipse , while the chapter devoted to impressions from a group of dedicated eclipse chasers , gives a sense of the magic of a total solar eclipse . there are plenty of drawings and photographs complement the writing , with an excellent set of references in the appendix . highly recommended , jerry levy ...
i 've lived in china since <NUM> , and i often read stories about china in the western media that i simply do n't believe . others report on abuses that do occur here without giving a reader any understanding of why . so , china remains `` inscrutable . '' ( i'm rolling my eyes ... ) china is a complex subject . how can a westerner who has never been here know what 's happening ? china is so far away and shrouded in a bit of mystery , some due to the sheer length of its history and some due to the power of the party . in my case , i do n't speak chinese , so getting past the public face is impossible . ian johnson of the wall street journal won a pulitzer prize for his reporting on china . he speaks the language . and , he 's one heck of a fine journalist . in wild grass , he recounts the stories of three ordinary chinese citizens who find themselves fighting the repression of the system , risking imprisonment and even death . johnson understands `` the big picture , '' and after reading this book , so will you . a nation is not just a single entity . it's made of people . all nations , not just the one you live in . so what are the people in china like ? read this book , and you'll feel like you 've met some of them . a peasant lawyer , a young architectural student , a bereaved daughter . poor farmers in yulin and party officials in beijing . johnson also brings the scenery to life , makes the unfamiliar familiar , and captures many little details and episodes and ironies . a compelling subject in the hands of a masterful author . china is experiencing unprecented economic development . what effect will this ultimately have on its social and political system ? i do n't agree with all of the author 's conclusions -- it surprises me how much i agree with the party -- but it does n't matter . that 's part of the beauty of this book . to bandy about phrases like `` evil empire '' is the simplistic idiocy that will ( i hope ) eventually doom morons like dubya . can we please move past that and try to genuinely understand ? there can be no doubt that what johnson reports in this book is factually accurate . if you want to learn about china , this is a good place to start . and then , form your own conclusions . there 's plenty of room for you to do that here . which , in the end , is what journalism is all about . i 'm quite glad that i read this book . this is literature , same as george orwell , who i also do n't always agree with . and agreement does not matter . spurring a reader to think is what matters . johnson can do that with the best of them .
this is the first molly blume mystery i 've read , and i really enjoyed it -- enough that i will probably go back and read the earlier ones , to find out how molly got to where she is . as an orthodox jew , i 'm impressed with the accuracy and understatement of ms. krich 's depiction of modern orthodox jews -- it 's so accurate , without painting the lifestyle as the source of all ills or the source of all happiness as a lot of other writers try to do . i 'm also looking forward to the next book . there are some hints in this one of molly 's possible infertility , and i really hope the author delves into that -- having her deal with fertility issues and treatments rather than just providing a miraculous baby . it 's such an important topic , especially within the orthodox world . i would love to see how molly deals with it
a very good movie if you can get by the sub titles .
this is a great cd . it is not quite as good as quality , but it is a mix cd so you ca n't expect it to be . the raps and rhymes are great . i think ms. hill is one of kweli 's finest songs . the only problem is the beats are a little sub par for kweli , but still a very good album anyways
i like this tape alot ( or well the cd-version ) . i dont get how ppl can dig the new stuff from 3-6 at all , thats just lame club music . the old stuff has the good beats ... but oh well its always the same story : at first they make real good songs just to get rid of anamosity , then comes the deals the money the industry and they start to produce crap for the mass .
this is one of the ultimate collection 's of pure music at its finest .... <NUM> problem thou ... on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names ... kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection : (
an exceptional production . jean matthews ' rise of the new woman provides a history of the women 's movement in america between 1875-1930 . this was the period which brought about fundamental changes in the lives and opportunities of american women : chapters show how women gained access to all levels of education and achievement , and how they struggled against doors still shut to their abilities
i saw fight club in the theaters in '99 , not knowing anything about chuck palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie . what i saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one * question * life , consumerism and where we 're going as a society . it was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been ; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection ( `` how much can you know about yourself if you 've never been in a fight '' , `` if you died right now how would you feel about your life ? `` , the whole raymond k. hessel scene ) ; intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others , and to top it all off probably the most innovative ( albeit difficult to believe ) surprise ending in film history cement fight club as a cult classic with a multi-layered , complex message that would make it perfect for a university student review essay . today , <NUM> years and several palahniuk books , fight club tee shirts and posters later ; after making my internet banking , credit card , phone , online gaming and isp logins `` tyler durden '' ; after police found a bunch of high schoolers in another county in my state imitating the movie in a local barn when they were busted after coming home to their parents with bloody noses ; after several people have read my email addy and quoted the movie or shot back a quick `` heyyy .... a fight club fan ! `` - the movie remains needless to say , my all-time favorite . there is very little grey area with people who 've seen it ( look no further than the rated reviews here ) - most either like it or hate it . if you 're a more intellectual `` thinker '' and a little graphic violence and foul language does n't easily offend you , give it a viewing ( or read the novel if you 're more bookworm than movie buff ) . the sign of a good song is that its melody and lyrics stay in your head long after you 've finished listening to it . the sign of a good * movie * is not only that its scenes and classic one-liners from an extremely intelligently-written script replay in your mind because they 're just that memorable , but that its message is so timely , relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it 's still talked about today . there are message boards on the net still discussing and debating new talking points about the movie today , <NUM> years later ; there are n't too many other films that have sparked this kind of intelligent , thoughtful and self-exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing . some of the more misogynistic scenes ( `` i 'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need '' ) are cast in a new light given palahniuk 's recent coming out of the closet , surprising many fans . on to the dvd itself . i own many , and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary , fight club paraphernelia , a couple hilarious psa 's and a cool music video . it 's considered by many to be one of the most comprehensive dvd 's ever produced . as to negatives : the film has some fairly graphic violence and a great deal of cussing & cursing , the latter of which detracts from a script ( imo ) . if you can move past this , get this dvd or at least give it a rent and watch what is destined to be one of the most talked-about classics of all time
this is the most heart touching book those odd people out there
i always liked nelly furtado for her originality but this new cd is very different than just about anything else out there . it 's difficult to define a genre for it as it 's very diverse . i was n't sure if i would like it as i found her other cds good but a little weird but on the contrary , i enjoyed the entire album . this is really a great album
a lot if not most greatest hits collections have some hits and some padding.not this album.this is one great collection.the five songs tacked on at the end made this album a must own masterpiece.if you like al green 's <NUM> 's output , you will like this cd.every single song is a classic.ol skool al green fans ( like myself ) might already have at least a couple of his albums already , but this cd sums up why he 's soul legend . p.s . : do yourself a favor and pick up some of his <NUM> 's era albums starting with `` i 'm still in love with you '' if you have n't already
dolores did a great at job interviewing phil in her studies , i found myself realizing that it all makes sense . the historcal gaps in history seemed to be filled with his recounts of earths of civilization thousands of years ago . not a typical abduction case , but a true eye opener . i related to many things in the book and feel that so much has been confirmed with me . i ca n't wait for a follow-up with phil . personally i ca n't wait to read it again
this is a great journey into narnia . i enjoyed every book and every chapter . i know everyone i talked to has read this book as a child , i think they need to re-read as an adult and really dig deeper into each chapter .
oh , wow ! this is a cd that will be liked by all who enjoy david lanz , mehdi , george winston , yanni , or even secret garden . it is the very essence of good new age . so tranquil , yet so spirited ( and finally a picture of the kern on the coverart ! ) , this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection , i just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again . i am amazed ! it reminds me somewhat of george winston , but still very unique . this is music to the soul . absolutely relaxing , as well . i also recommend : mehdi ~ instrumental heaven volume <NUM> .. truly a gem ... samples are at soothingmusic , com ... just listen .
accomplished director sidney lumet directs a insightful and prophetic satire from the expansive mind of paddy chayefsky critiquing the business of network television production . cca corporation frontman frank hackett played by robert duvall has taken over ubs network with the idea of finally turning it + into a profitable situation . lagging in ratings behind the big three , duvall focuses on the news division headed by max schumacher played by the aged but excellent william holden . duvall 's plan calls for the firing of long time news anchor howard beale played superbly in oscar winning fashion by peter finch . a disconsolate finch announces on air that in one weeks time , he will blow his head off during his newscast . his ratings take an immediate bump which comes to the attention of intensely obsessed tv generation programing vice president diana christiansen played by faye dunaway . dunaway encourages holden to keep finch on the air , against his better judgement but the ratings hike eventually flattens out . as finch 's time in gradually coming to an end , he has a bedroom epiphany which inspires him to come on the air after walking the rainy streets in his pajamas . in a heartfelt spew with wild gesticulations he calls for those watching who are frustrated with their existence , to open their windows and yell that they 're mad as hell and not gon na take it anymore . his rant strikes home and before long he is a media darling with the number one rated show . this opens the door for dunaway to fill her programing schedule with wild and revolutionary shows which threaten to drive ubs to the top of the network heap . as profits soar , corporate head arthur jensen played by supremely talented ned beatty is pleased . however finch goes too far with his angry prophet routine speaking out against corporate business practices . he receives an angry rebuke in a brilliant soliloquy by beatty , who decides that due to a ratings drop that finch must be silenced . a combination of lumet 's top notch direction , a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make `` network '' an all time cinematic classic
off the easy ! this mix is awesome , especially the ruff ryders anthe
clueless has been released on dvd before , with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features . in <NUM> , for its 10th anniversary , paramount finally released a great , if not cheesily named , dvd edition of this <NUM> 's teen comedy classic , with such quotable lines as `` you 're a virgin who ca n't drive '' and `` as if ! '' the transfer on this dvd is awesome . it 's very clean , sharp , and clear . i do n't remember any issues on the past dvd , but if there were any , it seems like they were cleared up for this release . the bonus features are likeable fluff , but at least they 're existent . featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members , such featurettes as `` the class of '95 , '' which discusses the cast , and `` language arts , '' which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon , allow us to delve , if only just slightly , into the making and the impact of this movie . also , the trailers from the previous dvd release are included . children of the <NUM> 's definitely need to own this dvd . clueless is still a major part of america 's pop culture today , and really , who does n't love watching a <NUM> 's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like jane austen 's emma
living in a milieu far removed from his intoxicating days as a rising painter gaining increasing esteem for his flattering portraits , henry macalpine has isolated himself in a form of penance ... perhaps the penance is for the things he did , for his past selfishnessnes , his past surrender to the `` establishment '' , the easy painting that would please and sell swiftly rather than the more difficult portraitures that strip down , as he puts it , to the skull and even to the soul . but my sense is that his penance is not really for these things . it is for what he will do ... iain pears is a writer of distinction . more than that , although he writes literature that i believe will be enjoyed by readers of wit centuries from now , pears is also a writer who can tell a rattling good story . his turn of phrase - delicious ! i grew to know this henry macalpine as he unburdens himself to his subject , so that macalpine was not just painting a portrait of the self-satisfied old friend , the `` great '' critic william naysmith , but he is also painting a portrait of himself . we see it all - his attitude to sexuality , religion , penance , art , men , women , crime , superficiality , everything . we see how he has altered and developed , and how he has remained what he is , for in the flowing change and in the constancy both ... that is where the truth and validity of a human being lies . we change . we do not change . that is our lot . perhaps in this sense , at the mercy of events , we are true to macalpine 's vision of humanity - ludicrous in the face of the great forces such as a storm . but macalpine in all his imperfect self is also revealed by his monologue ... and we know we do not take his view as a point of absolute truth ( a lovely trick , that . pears did the same thing in `` instance of the fingerpost '' , leaving an unsettling notion that the last narrator was the `` real '' truth , but careful reading reveals that it is all just ... points of view , self-deceptions , however true the narrator attempts to be ) . perhaps , then , we are not so ludicrous , and perhaps we transcend the forces of nature . iain pears 's palette-rich writing shows such a balance of line and colour in the careful choice of words , phrases , flow of written thoughts . i can almost smell the texture - it is like `` reading '' a painting . the book glows with colour , the subtle highlights of the artist 's brush . some reviewers have not taken to the monologue style used in this book - i found it extremely effective , and also such a delicious irony in that the critic , wordy and pompous as he clearly was , has absolutely no say here . he is drawn to macalpine 's retreat in what seems at first his own choice , but right from the start , i sensed that this was not exactly the case . iain pears leads the reader through an extraordinary thread of narrative that is remembrance through the eyes of one man . we learn of macalpine 's fascination with the image of death , the futility of man in the grip of forces greater than he is , an image of decaying flesh washed up on the shore . we learn also ( but suspect it early on ) what macalpine considers the real crime that would impel a certain act of murder . that the denouement is inevitable and foreseen by the reader does not diminish the fascination of this wonderfully dark novel . pears could have written a different book , a book in which the reader is `` fooled '' ? la typical thriller plots . but this book is not a thriller . it is a portrait that creates knowledge , and paints ever more deeply to find motivations and reasons and shadings and colourings , not merely the bare facts . consider this : we know within quite a few pages what is to come . but like garc ? a marquez 's extraordinary `` chronicle of a death foretold '' , it 's not what ... it 's why , how ... give us the details ; it 's the details we want . i found this work very satisfying . i did not find the monologue style tedious at all , and as soon as i realised pears wanted us to suspect what was coming , i read not to find out the end , but to `` read '' the brush-strokes . for those who will approach it in this way , i think that there is a gripping and fascinating reading experience waiting for you . for those who want a twist in the tail with an unexpected ending , no ... this miniature portrait of a book is probably not for you . read the book as a revelation of the skull and soul of two men , and perhaps you too will love this book as much as i did
this will appeal to many people , from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story . myself , i always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society , and the story of vaccination is terrific . aside from the fun aspect of this book , mr. allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children 's autism was caused by vaccines . there has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue ( particularly by people like don imus -- he should be ashamed of himself ) , which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child 's disability . i hope very much that mr. allen 's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation
this is a gently heartbreaking film set in tehran , a city flooded with afghan refugees during the time of taliban rule in their homeland . it touches on several themes , including the plight of the refugees , and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry . much of the story takes place at a construction site , where the central character , a young iranian , a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen , gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father , injured at the work site . the young man 's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl , and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family . though they never exchange a word in the film , she leaves a deep impression on him , and he is utterly changed by his experience . a story that is about the transformation of character , the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process , often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines , wordlessly ponders his situation , or goes in search of the girl and her family . director magid magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men , the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them , and the unforgiving weather ( snow , rain , cold ) in which they all labor . recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media
`` the big buy '' may not have the slick gloss of other documentaries , but the content is invaluable in understanding how american democracy has been hijacked . birnbaum and schermbeck show how tom delay deliberately reengineered the electoral system to create an incestuous alliance of lobbyists and government officials on a scale not seen before in american politics . this culture of corruption demands business representatives pay thousands of dollars for access to politicians -- akin to practices normally associated with self-serving third world governments . in the meantime , the interests of average americans are shunted aside . the documentary cautions that , even though delay has had to step down , others of his ilk have replaced him and are carrying on his legacy . another outstanding source revealing the magnitude of corruption that has taken hold is pbs 's bill moyers on america . the first episode , `` capitol crimes , '' connects the dots regarding jack abramoff , tom delay , grover norquist and others who brought an agenda to d.c. to buy out congress with a view to creating a permanent republican congress whose power derives from monies given to it by big business . one definition of fascism is a government aligned in partnership with corporate businesses . `` the big buy '' shows how tom delay has created that model for american in the 21st century . it begs the question -- as we now try to export democracy to other countries -- can we claim to be democracy anymore
here it is now , <NUM> , and we have moved back into the <NUM> 's in so many ways . look at so many <NUM> somethings like paris hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it . look at all the role models we see in films and tv , where women are either bitches , promiscuous , or over-siliconed airheads . thank god howard stern is no longer on tv . we 've come a complete <NUM> degrees , and women get no respect . i do n't think hilary clinton and condoleeza are any help . the women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence , stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us . now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them . the number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide . let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing , and the cops do n't bother to look for her . it 's ok to the authorities if young women get killed . who cares except the grieving family ? it 's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends , and the girls still love and protect them . women are to be used , abused , and disposed of . our society is run by men , for men , and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years . we ca n't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion . daddy government says no . all the right wing `` christians '' running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion , barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force . and women do n't even get it ! i am currently packing to move to scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals . birth control , abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted . unlike america , in a few countries women at least own their own bodies
easy to read , understand , and put into practice . common sense , practical advice . similar content as his `` being zen '' book
this is a great comedy cd . sabes que i barely got it . i heard it was very funny , but it did n't interest me that much . i finally bought it and thought it was very funny . it is a must have from george lopez 's fans . i can relate to many of the things he mentions , which makes everything even more hilarious . recomended
as a musician , i find & quot ; not guilty & quot ; to be of a very high standard , musically . calvin rodgers is awesome and unmatched on the drums . the musicians kept the groove in the pocket . this is a very professionally done project and it is an example of a & quot ; more excellent way & quot ; of ministering the gospel in today 's world.i listen to the cd daily . who said that we can not play jazz , r & amp ; b , rap , hip hop etc etc ? yes , & quot ; it 's possible & quot ; but the difference here is the anointing ; lyrics to point folks to jesus , and music , saturated with the god kinda vibe played in the vernacular of the man on the street . pastor kee , you are a trend setter . keep up the good work . so folks , go out there and purchase a copy today . it will change your life
james patterson 's work over a decade ago stopped consistently being masterpiece after masterpiece and became very hit and miss with very average novels published throughout most of his recent career , with only the odd great read every now and then published , with readers just keep picking up each successive novel hoping the old quality will be back . well i 'm pleased to say , it is back with the angel experiment . i must admit i was very surprised as patterson 's last attempt at the children 's market santakid , well as those of us unfortunate enough to have read it know , pitiful is being nice . with maximum ride the angel experiment , quality is achieved albeit for a much older children 's market than santakid . well actually i do n't even know why the publishers say this is a kids book ( young adult ) as it is even more violent than the two adult novels in this series and although it has been a while since i read when the wind blows and the lake house i did n't really notice any differences in the way they are written . obviously it 's just a marketing thing by the publishers to sell more books in this series . although you could read this as a stand alone novel you really do need to have previously read the two adult novels before this as well to understand and enjoy this story to its full extent , so marketing this and the subsequent novels in this series as a younger age group does n't make much sense but adults will love this book anyway . in maximum ride the angel experiment , max and the five other kids with wings are back for the third instalment in the series . they are happily living in their secluded hide out which jed , the good scientist from the school who unfortunately met his demise in the previous books set up for them . their peaceful existence is smashed however when the youngest girl angel is taken by erasers ( bad creations from the school ) . max takes control and organises a rescue mission where the children all discover they have other powers they haven not tapped into yet . the mission will take them not only to the rural school but to new york and the answers to their past they so have longed for all their lives . some unpleasant surprises are on the way for max and the others that will repulse them beyond any level they 've endured before !
a 10-week program in new york city schools teaches ballroom dancing to 5th graders , imparting lessons about self-worth , respect , and etiquette . some of the students go on to dance in a city-wide competition . this documantary focuses on the children of three schools as they prepare for the showdown . as many other reviewers have noted , the film would have benefitted from a finer focus on a smaller number of kids . this would have allowed us to see more of their personal lives and place the program in its context . nervertheless , there are many joyful sequences in this film , and the children are charming . those qualities go a long way
vincent works for microsoft and has consequently had unique access their development organization . this books reflects this fact with frequent stories and asides - and for which alone its purchase is recommended . there is some good advice and tips in here , however i do n't particularly like the latter chapters as they merely descend into an advert for the build capabilities in the ( at the time forthcoming ) microsoft team system
i thought this album was a good one . i have been listening to tmv since tremulant first came out . i thought frances the mute was good , but it was just too much . i loved deloused and i think this new on is a proper mix of deloused and frances the mute . tmv is still progressing with their sound and it definatley shows in this album . if you are not an avid listener and do not own deloused you might want to pick it up and start the tmv experience there . otherwise , i fell this is a great record . definatley an easier listen then frances the mute
i love this storyline . baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be , and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard
i learn so much from these books-have about6 different ones . the index in this is the best to look up anything you want to know about taking care-good care of your dog
awesome dvd ! jake roberts tells you everything from origin of the ddt to the drug addiction to the last time he appeared on wwe television . this is definitely a must have ! jake the snake is a true legend and deserves to in the hall of fame . maybe it will happen in <NUM>
i do not have many kenny loggins cd 's . i bought the & quot ; essentials & quot ; cd 's and then found out about this one . i am really enjoying this cd . the songs & quot ; fit & quot ; into my playlists whether i am playing only kenny loggins music or playing other artists as well . it is always good when i can mesh the music with my mood . so far i have been able to pull out this cd and find something that matched . i would have liked a few more songs
al capone does my shirts is a fiction story about a boy , matthew flannegan `` moose '' and his family who live on alcatraz . moose is faced with many challenges throughout his childhood including having to take care of his older sister , natalie , who has autism . whatever the challenge though moose always finds a way to over come it . this book is wonderful for all ages- children and adults . i highly recommend this book to people who like to read books that have many adventures . gennifer choldenko is an amazing author and i plan on reading more of her books . if i loved it you probably will too .
candyman is a untique boogeymen and the story is great and all i have to say is to not go to a mirror and say his name five times ..... candyman is about a mythical guy that was ridcule by a bunch of towns people and they pour honey all over him and watch him get stung to death by bees .... the reason why the towns people did this was he fell in love with a woman .... the candyman is a great horror flick and its great to watch over and over again ! ! ! ! ! !
i love frost , and its not just because it almost sounds like frog . `` frost '' is a great crime series , which , in stark contrast to almost every mainstream american detective show , refuses to glamorize either criminals or the people who pursue them . rather than wrapping up every crime into nice black and white labels or a tidy little paradox , `` frost '' leaves the viewer with a sobering sense for the dissonances and crises that afflict every the body politic . but what i love most is the wondering dismal grey denton atmosphere . i can almost imagine i 'm back in the swamp
i 've had every edition of this drug handbook for about <NUM> years now , and i use it often . i 've seen lots of `` other '' veterinary drug handbooks , but they pale in comparison to plumb 's . there 's just the right amount of information here -- not too much , not too little . other handbooks seem relatively lacking in content
i 've just reread `` the cat who smelled a rat . '' in it , jim qwilleran is still in fine mettle . this mystery , no . <NUM> in the `` cat who '' series , is the last one most fans will enjoy . in this book , qwill still remembers small details from previous novels . he 's still interested in the mysteries around him , and he does some active snooping around . he 's still a bit of the lothario despite himself . and he still has faith in koko 's awesome powers . starting with the next book , the mystery gets solved almost by accident . qwill becomes a parody of himself , and the novels start to get worse and worse . eventually , the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act , well , out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight . ( the latter must be hard to do in a small town <NUM> miles north of anywhere . ) whether lilian jackson braun , now approaching <NUM> , has lost her touch , or whether they 're being ghost-written , i leave to you to judge . but the books become just dreadful . i recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after no . <NUM> . it 's been a good run
this is a horror sci-fi masterpiece just watch it ... this film reminded me of videodrome and the fly and a little bit of eraserhead it might not be up there with them but its a classic for sure
excellent foreword by joe miller not mentioned in information . these sutras give you the essence of buddhism not the trappings . essential for someone wanting to know the real thing . if you find the meaning of these sutras you are on your way to nowhere with nothin
what a shame . such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are . jay ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists . he achieved success in <NUM> forms ( spirit , jo jo and thunder island solo ) . this is a great , gritty , greasy , soulful southern rock album . i would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band . how about metalica doing run , run run ?
joseph conrad is my favorite author , and i 'm close to having read everything he 's written . this is my favorite novel . i 've read the criticism , that it 's too sentimental , that its characters are n't as rich as in other conrad tales ... bumpkis . consider schomberg , consider heyst ... well , unless you 've read the novel of course you ca n't . i encourage you to . i 've read that it was conrad 's favorite , and one can understand why , in heyst we get a glimpse into the soul of the aloof author , and in the memorable final word of the novel we get an impression of what he saw in the world . no other conrad novel with the possible exception of lord jim has so personally affected me , and if like him , and like heyst , you have sloughed off sentimentality , abandoned your romantic side , then maybe this novel has something to teach you . i certainly learned something
this is the best personal finance book written in plain english that i have read . i will be buying one for each of my grown children . they are n't listening to me about saving `` for a rainy day '' so i hope that equipped with the information in this book , they will get the full picture . ( and it wo n't be from mom )
captivating from start to finish : emi has programmed & remastered this bounty of britten choral work superbly . the choir of king 's college , cambridge performs with stunning sensitivity , ethereal , heartbreaking & transcendent . a just classic dis
i was in search of a good figure drawing book with an emphasis on animation and comics and this one caught my eye . after reading through , practicing the techniques and understanding them , i 'm convinced that this is the most invaluable book i have in my large collection of art books . this book completely changed the way i draw . i 've been drawing seriously for roughly <NUM> years and once the ideas in this book clicked , it made me feel as if i 'd been drawing the wrong way for all those years . well worth the <NUM> bucks or whatever it was i payed for it . i would n't recommend this book to beginners however . it 's not really a how to draw or a book that covers basic proportion and anatomy issues . for somebody to get the most out of this book , i think they 'd need to have a solid grasp on anatomy and fundamental drawing techniques . on the other hand , a beginner may benefit from this book simply from a gesture standpoint . easily a <NUM> out of <NUM> for me
transforming a rape culture , by milkweed editions is a book that has input from thirty-seven active feminists ; twenty-five women and twelve men , who all play different roles in life . their occupations range from book and article writers , to psychologists , speakers , teachers , parents , and more . having many authors , instead of just one , gives this book an advantage over one author 's opinion . it was definitely written to spark an emotion in everybody to make change . the book 's topic effects and influences everybody in some way in life to make a change , even if it 's just within themselves . it succeeded in doing so . the book analyzes the factors in our culture , which promote and support not only rape , but also sexual assault , and harassment . it also presents ideas and methods to end it . all the sections throughout this book are linked nicely together giving it a strong analytical flow from all the authors - all seeking nothing less than a fundamental culture change with a method achieve it through the change of power , gender , race , and religion
one of the most fun-loving , infectious bands to ever walk the earth delivering a fine performance to their home crowd . i skipped a star because a band of this stature deserves the best in sound quality for any dvd they release ( and so do their fans . )
longer ago than i care to remember i had the great fortune to meet einstein . i was an under grad in college when he made one of his unannounced visits to the campus . walter matthau captures the professor briliantly and his humor and wit come through in this film . einstein 's interest in motorcycles and his love of sailing are portrayed lovingly and the very human side of the great man is illustrated with fidelity and humor . it is always on my list of ten favorite films .
this book has many useful , practical ideas for effectively using literacy workstations . my school year has started so smoothly because of the things i learned from this book . i highly recommend it to anyone new to workstations , and even to veteran teachers for a fresh perspective
if you need a quick introduction to amon duul ii this is the album for you .the album showcases amon duul at their best and with the best line up and with a great set of songs.other amon duul ii albums have long tracks and improvisations that take a while to get into .this is one of my favorite albums of all time .the live version of archangels thunderbird is just awesom
i love the alice books even though sometimes they shock me with their content to be honest . i have read about <NUM> of these books and i go out of order because i ca n't always find the ones i 'm looking for . i read `` including alice '' before this and thought it was n't that great ; this one was much better . there is comedy , irony , heart break and some happy moments too . alice and her friends are very much like a lot of teens that i have come in contact with . i was pretty sad about her break up with patrick although i knew they were broken up already . i really think they are each other 's first loves but i doubt they will end up together in the end . most teen romances just do n't work out .
i 've watched this video many times and i never tire of hearing and seeing the beats these men and women make with common , everyday items . i have used it in my pe class and i have friends who have used it in music/band . it is a great classroom resource as well as an entertaining work of art .
paul newman is great as a despairing , alcoholic `` david '' , once second in his law class , once part of a prestigious law firm , once married ... till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury . the above is past history ... just mentioned in the film . it is some years after , and alcoholic newman , with only <NUM> cases in the last few years , ... has an epiphany ... where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture , so to speak , of a woman treated unjustly , whom he can help . he forgets himself and his troubles , and the people who have pushed him around , ... and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman ... against the hospital and doctors who damaged her . he will later awaken the conscience ( as the movie hints ) of one of the `` goliaths '' he goes up against . however , there are pitfalls ... as opposing lawyer concannon is not above using any trick -- -or person ... to destroy the case . paul newman 's epiphany scene ( which i wo n't describe further to spoil it for you , but which is clearly recognizable ) is quite moving . his goliaths include : the biased , hostile judge , the `` prince of darkness '' superlawyer concannon ( played well by james mason , always good at suave villians ) , the doctors and * * most * * of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate deborah ann kaye , ... and the somewhat hesitant bishop brophy , head of st. catherine 's , the hospital where mrs. kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage . set in boston , a largely catholic city ( i am told ) we here have nominal catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the christian `` good samaritan '' story seriously . my family caution : there are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene . the verdict implies the barely seen <NUM> who also are key players ... the jury , who must deliver the verdict . will they go with the letter of the law ? or -- -its spirit ? ( if you are familiar with this phrase from the christian faith , you have the answer ... ) ( hint of spoiler below ) my wish is that brain injured terri schiavo had had a jury who could see the spirit of the law ! instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a congress that dared ( how dare they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude ) to merely ask for a second look at the whole case . meanwhile , terri slowly starved to death ... shame on us ! shades of nazi eugenics ! ! !
bend it like beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you . this is a smart , funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for . i urge every mother to give her daughter this dvd for a birthday , christmas or graduation gift . i think they 'll thank you for it . bend it like beckham follows jess , a young british girl of indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol david beckham . she strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional indian parents who want her to conform to traditional indian culture . i love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family . she perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream . there are a lot of funny moments in this movie ; i do n't want to give too much away this movie is too good to spoil . i love this movie ; this is how movies should be made . the cinematography in this movie is amazing ; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen . the entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about . look for keira knightley in a supporting role . a shawn james five star essential movie . definitely get this movie along with the wonderful muriel 's wedding , a great australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey .
each character is perfect . the women are so loving and the men so caring that they pair up nicely in four sweltering short stories . they live in a fantasy world full of friendship , kindness , and romance . life is wonderful ; no major worries except whether they like and love each other but those never last long . everybody earns some sort of good income . everything comes to a faultless ending . each story involves hot chocolate suitable to the title of the collection . it is a great read before going to bed
if you 've never bought a country cd in your life , make this your first . it is haunting . i defy anyone to play this just once . i always repeat it at least <NUM> times . the man is the most potent proof that one can reveal the age of one 's soul through his music . as flat & shallow as the most electronically plumped pop crap on the so called country charts today , is hank williams iii deep . next to iii , his father may as well be a fat drunk in a seedy karaoke bar . this young man does his grandpa proud & them some . he seems possessed of the spirit without having to struggle to invent an identity of his own like his father before him to step out of big hank 's shadow . iii steps into the shadow and lights it up like a state fair on the 4th of july . it is all there . it has skipped a generation but it is in the marrow of his bones . in fact he 's a damn good living argument for re-incarnation if you ask me . haunting is a word that is in my mind every time i play my copy of one of his albums . but this is n't for someone looking for a fair impression of grandpa as his father once did . i myself find myself listening to iii then putting on a bit of grandpa & after a few songs i 'm hungry for this all together new phenomenon . the dimensions he reveals & the music he creates in doing so . it 's not old fashioned country , nor rockabilly , punk , rock or anything that i think can be pigeon holed . it is as new a form as the bop with which charlie parker once rocked the jazz world . hank iii 's versatility is beyond description . surrounding himself with a posse of daredevil side men who are as hot , versatile & inventive as he , hank iii will have you banging on the internet for more discs & cursing his woebegone label for holding him back . so talented & so obviously deep a well of humanity is this young man that it would come as no surprise to me if someone , someday mined a great acting ability from that well . the distant mournful look in his eyes within the innocent childlike face belies any image of less to which any reviewer of poorer soul may point . he is at once , dark , mournful , childishly cocky , sexy , raw & miscieveouly playful . he has a facet for every emotion a listener can possibly need expressed through music . you will put him on when you 're blue and end up cheered , you will put him on for a good time & end up haunted long after the album has reached it 's end . he comes across as the kind of guy with whom any fun loving man would like to roll one , go out & get plastered & any woman would want to hole up for a stormy few days in shack with a guitar & couple of bottles of j.d . i pray he can get by & be happy without ever selling out to the industry & falling into the same crap mold of all the big nashville/hollywood stars who pass for country artists today . listen to this boy & every country record , tape or cd you own that is n't his , his grandfather 's or patsy cline 's will gather a thick layer of dust before you put them in a giveaway box where they belong . he will surely leave you with an allergy to sequins sharp black suits and grammy winning , bleached white teeth . there was hank williams & there is hank williams iii . do n't need nobody else & if ya do , you must have a tin ear , shallow life , black heart and a deep dark hole where your soul oughtta be . hank williams jr. -- do yourself a favor old man & retire . he has come -- no thanks to you !
i have a <NUM> month old daughter and she loves this book ! the colors are bright but not too busy and the words flow easily . i love the fact that the narrator is chinese-american and is able to blend traditional chinese culture with contemporary american culture . i ca n't wait until my daughter understands what it is saying and can begin to pick out shapes
this is more like it . a good exciting book that keeps on moving . it was not as good as absolute power but way better than the winner . i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good non-stop excitment
as a boy , i hated all country music , because my father hated rock'n roll . but i knew that hank williams was something special . i bought his <NUM> greatest several years ago , thinking that this was the ultimate collection . however , for some reason , when this <NUM> cd collection came out , i bought it . if anyone thinks hank williams was one of the greatest preformers ever based on his hits , you need to hear these cd 's . his versions of songs such as & quot ; cool water & quot ; & quot ; the old home & quot ; & quot ; rocking chair money & quot ; and many others make his hits seem tame . these recordings are masterpieces
i saw leahy in concert at milwaukee 's irish cultural center . the experience is beyond words . we were clapping , yelling , and dancing in our seats ! that prompted me to buy their first album and i was not disappointed . the musicianship is terrific and the selection unbeatable . i 've listened to it many , many times and it never grows old . thanks leahy !
technically , this is new edition minus bobby brown , ralph tresvant and johnny gill . brown , by <NUM> when this album was released , was enjoying a successful solo career , especially from many sales of his second <NUM> release do n't be cruel . tresvant released his self-titled debut also . so the remaining three ne members ricky bell , michael bivins and ronnie devoe became bell biv devoe . you can see on the album cover that one member has the official ne logo on his sweatshirt . these guys started their musical careers as typical r & b artists in <NUM> ( jackson <NUM> clones , vocally ) . and now they 're `` hippin ' and hoppin ' '' ! ne released their debut candy girl in '83 , the self-titled album followed the following year , and between then and <NUM> , released three more albums .
jon b. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with cool relax . <NUM> of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by jon b. himself . with hands on experience , this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners . for the most part , `` bad girl '' has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the lp . hearing jon reach for the higher notes on `` ca n't help it '' was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive . the title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track . 2pac was featured with equal time on `` are you still down '' as he almost stole the show until near the end where jon b. flexed his abilities . `` i do ( whatcha say boo ) '' is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married . he then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on `` i ai n't going out '' . the inviting `` can we get down '' is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually . hearing jon croon in another language on `` tu amor '' sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title . there 's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with
so this is real-life anime . wow . i 'm stunned . where perfect blue and millennium actress failed , tokyo godfathers greatly achieves . i loved this film . it 's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time . we 've all struggled -- some to the point of being homeless . we 've all had defeating family issues . and we 've all wanted nothing more than to get away ; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package . and the story itself is touching . how can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother ? these three very unique individuals struggle to no end , facing bodily harm , organized crime , aids , and a possessive father , just to get this tiny little child to a safe place , a home , where it can be loved . and all of their efforts comes across as genuine . excellent
this movie is excellent , and probably much better than any subsequent work done by moore . my kids love it , especially his lamentation in the bar after being fired . i have to admit that i never was a big moore fan - his work done with peter cook was a bit offensive , and this movie proves that humour need not offend . mark fredericks esq
in her book web thinking , successful hollywood screenwriting consultant and author of numerous books on the entertainment industry , dr. linda seger reveals the real secret to success in any job . she hits the nail on the head -- it 's about relationships . in my years as a performance improvement specialist to fortune <NUM> corporations , <NUM> % of success was not just showing up ( like woody allen has said ) , nor is it technical competence and know-how ( as our school systems wrongly assume ) , but rather the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships with our peers , our suppliers and our customers . people get jobs and lose them primarily because their egos are too big to help others succeed . or as seger puts it , we need to be `` connecting , not competing . '' regardless , listen to the interviews with a-listers in any industry . more often it 's not the project that creates the critical mass for a greenlight , but how much one person wants to work with another . linda 's writing was very helpful in the writing of my own book on screenwriting published by michael wiese productions : the moral premise : harnessing virtue and vice for box office success
this is a very complete book on all aspects of us plus sized women -- clothing , style and fit , accessories , makeup , etc . i highly recommend it if you tend to need occasional assistance in fit and style
i did n't find this cd to be as fabulous as careless love but , still enjoy it
this is a book that will change your outlook on life in america . it is the plea of one man , crying out against the sytematic infiltration of corporate power and greed into every area of life . in this courageous work , gerry spence takes on what he calls , the & quot ; oligarchical & quot ; power of the corporate world , exposing its manipulation of even our most personal beliefs . on issues from the environment , police brutality , polital corruption and homelessness , to the dominating influence that this power has on the individual level , he leaves no stone unturned in his search for justice in america . anyone who is interested in the social problems of our country will find this book a great source of knowledge , insight , and even outrage . this book simply asks the reader to look at american society as it is , not as it was taught to many of us in public school , and then think about how these problems can be overcome
this is one of rob schneider 's best movies . schneider plays as a middle-aged `` hobo '' that switches bodies with a popular mean high-school girl . rachel mcadams has to find the guy that is inside of her body so they can switch back before it is too late
if ride the lightning was the manifesto then this is the revolution of heavy metal . this is one of the greatest musical pieces every written . over the first three cd 's metallica recorded they changed the way the world would look at heavy meta
many of the other reviews have summarized akira kurosawa 's excellent film , so i wo n't recap it since you are probably familiar with the seven samurai . rather , if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release , rest easy . it is well worth the price . having seen the movie many , many times , i was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details i had missed . the supplemental materials ( commentaries , documentaries , interviews , and the booklet ( with reminiscences from mifune toshiro ) complement the movie nicely . if you are on the fence , go ahead and buy it . this dvd is worth it
this is a great film . but , sadly , it would never be made today . i mean , try to imagine a film in which a <NUM> or <NUM> year of character has an abortion and it is taken as just another plot point . ( compare this to crowe 's singles which brought back the oh so convienent miscarriage , like something out of a <NUM> 's movie . ) also , imagine a film begin made today which invests so much time in developing its characters . yep , you ca n't . so enjoy it for what it is , a window on a lost world .
i rate this movie <NUM> stars , or 9,5/10 . the movie is included among the <NUM> best movies on dvd by peter travers . this new line platinum series edition is really beautiful , with a dvd case simulating the notebook that john doe uses in the movie , and with a second disc full of supplemental material . i miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory `` how it was made '' or `` behind the scenes '' documentary . you see deleted scenes and extended takes , alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards , etc . the movie in disc one comes with an audio track specially recorded for the dvd edition , and in my home theatre sounds terrific . also we have <NUM> different audio commentaries , by director fincher , freeman , pitt and other collaborators on the film . this is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives ( one new -pitt- another about to retire -freeman- ) after a serial killer ( always brilliant spacey ) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins , and kills people who represents them . after the 5th murder , he turns himself in and the last two ( envy and wrath ) are just a masterpiece of an invention . i 've probably seen this movie just <NUM> or <NUM> times , but i ca n't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story . this is a masterpiece of a movie . i rarely give 10/10 points to movies , so i gave this 9.5/10 . to be picky , i 'd like a `` hit '' song with the closing credits . but that is just me being picky . the music by howard shore is good . the photography is excellent , the script is in my opinion the very best , and morgan freeman and brad pitt are fabulous . the movie was nominated for best film editing for the academy awards but won nothing . a must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan . your collection is not complete without this one . and for the price ( $ 13.99 while i am writing this ) you ca n't get any wrong
first i have seen this movie a few times , also have it vhs . i love all types of movies . plus the shipper was faster than the expected delivery date . again , i always have loved this movie , and i am glad i have the dvd ... now if only the remaining titles on my list were to come out .. like the spanish main ( paul henreid <NUM> ) , against all flags ( errol flynn , <NUM> ) and at swords point ( cornel wilde,1952 ) and black sheild of falsworth ( tony curtis ) my collection would be complete . thank you amazon ! !
even a few years after it 's release , eric schlosser 's `` fast food nation '' still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is ... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies ... not a purveyor of good food -- or nutritious food for that matter . for many years , food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry , but not these things are starting to surface . the book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to `` make '' the foods served at these restaurants . it opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process . i 've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all , probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food . since this book came out , there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before . reports including additives , trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it 's act . this does n't mean that fast food is good for you , it just means that schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that was n't challenged as strongly as it should have been . i personally have n't had fast food for over <NUM> years , but -- even that far removed -- as i was reading this i felt sick to my stomach . read this book and you 'll never step foot in mcdonalds again . kevin gianni , ncsf-cpt author and personal traine
i liked trouble but i think this cd is a little better . i like the musical arrangements better this time around . the addition of john medeski and chris wood give the music a deeper more full sound . trouble sounded mostly like ray playing an acoustic guitar . where till the sun turns black really has some excelent backing musicians . lyrically i like both about the same . i say to get both discs they have alot to offer .
this book arrived in adequate time and was in great condition . there was no trouble with delivery , it was on time
a sad commentary on our society that only the audio versions of this book are available . with the increase of interest in the first world war recently it is to this book that many people should turn for a gripping , factual account of life before , during and after the great war . mr graves documents the pastoral quiet of england in the early part of the twentieth century and abruptly descends to recounting , in cold detail , the dreadful slaughter of the trenches . through some of the most famous battles in history he survives , physically more or less intact but from the dry words ; modest , english , reserved , we glimpse the true weight of the burden that such memories impose on their carriers and understand better the terrible toll that the war levied on all the nations of europe
anyone who has seen and felt the vastness of west texas will want to read this book . kelton 's characters and settings are remarkable and genuine . this was one of the finest books i 've read and it goes far beyond being catagorized as a western . it is about people and relationships with others and the land
chris abani ranks right up there with chinua achebe and wole soyinka in my book . he peels away the glossy shell of life and dives right into the soft underbelly where life and death compete side by side . graceland took my breath away with its vivid rendering of lagos and nigeria , it 's compassionate protagonist , and its heartfelt stuggle to do more than merely survive . abani writes with such passion and insight that i was easily swept away with every sentence . i used to work in nigeria , and it all came rushing back to me with this book - the sights , the sounds , the smells , the pace . . . it 's all there . raucous music mingling with car horns . burning tires overpowering the barbeque chicken . palm wine and beer . overfilled jitneys . waterlogged slums . bar beach market . i have read this book twice already and am still not tired of it . in addition , i 've read his poetry in `` daphne 's lot '' and `` kalakuta republic '' and found them to be as melodic and memorable as `` graceland . '' i definitely recommend that you buy and read this book . it will earn a place in your heart and your top ten fiction list .
i loved it and look forward to more of her books . the lead character was very likable and it was fun watching her journey through the break-up and divorce and how she was able to cope . it is a book of hope for anyone who has had marital problems or just pure fantasy and fun for those who have not
this anthology features extensive introductions by smiley ( a writer 's perspective ) and kellog ( a philological analysis ) , illustrations ( maps , genealogies , drawings of habitats ) , an excellent reference section , a thoughtful glossary , and brilliant translations of some of the best prose sagas . the more difficult poetic materials ( e.g. , the poetic edda ) are unfortunately not covered , but reasonable translations are available elsewhere . the material provides ample room for an initial but deeper understanding of norwegian culture . if you were ever curious about norway and iceland , do n't just sit there : read this book
why is it so hard for us to give this man the credit he deserves ? we 've seen the movies and read the books . and yet , every time i see a book by john grisham in hangzhou , i think , `` i do n't have to finish reading it if i do n't like it . '' i think of his value as trade bait , since he 's so popular . and yet , i have never put aside a john grisham book unread . what more does he have to do ? become less popular ? the premise on the back cover is simple enough . a homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage , somebody dies , and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience . you have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea . i 've read almost everything grisham has written , and i can remember most of it , and i 'd have to put this at the top of the list . he 's a master of character , plotting , simplifying the complex , setting , words , and accessibility . the writer should do all the work so the reader does n't have to . john grisham , folks . he 's the genuine article . let 's say it , okay ?
having grown up hearing this album at summer picnics all over the texas hill country during the <NUM> 's , i had to get this album to take with me when i leave . to me , this captures what live music was like in that area during that time . after having spent many summer nights at places like floore 's country store , gruene hall and cibolo creek , i can certainly feel at home with this album . imagine a warm night with cool breezes , cold beer and crickets ( whose presence is better heard on the cd of this album ... ) . toss in the smell of cedar and live oak with a dash of a musty walls and you 're all set ! this album is not to be taken as a top-notch , pristine live recording of a legend playing his hits and the audience roars with wild applause after each . this is as laid-back as the scene was back then . and this is a fun show . i would like to someday hear an expanded version of this show with any more material that might have been performed that night . then i 'd have to get more beer
`` oh my goodness ! ! ! '' if you love a feel good , emotional roll-a-coaster , family movie . this is it ! ! this is one of the best movies i have ever watched . it has all the elements of every emotion you can come up with . the actors are superb and you feel like your part of the scene . i have watched it <NUM> times and will watch it again . just make sure you have a box of kleenex handy
this albums rocks . nothing is more brutal than black flag when fronted by rollins . in my opinion , this was black flag at their punk best . not much can be said about this album that has n't already been said . i highly reccomend anyone even slightly interested in getting into hardcore get this album , it 's a rush from start to finish
i 'm no musician , but i bought this and the cd containing these songs for my brother , who has been learning to play many old standards from the 60s , 70s , and 80s . he thought it was a great christmas gift ; he 's really enjoying it !
this is one of the best albums of the last <NUM> years and certainly one of the best i have ever heard . if you like good music like the beatles , kinks , rolling stones , wilco , fountains of wayne , beck , coldplay , prince , or radiohead , then you will probably not be disappointed by this cd
maggie is a professor of history at somerset county community college , but she toils during her time off working on her antique business where she specializes in rare prints . right now maggie is attending a social function being given by dorothy and oliver whitcomb , major contributors to the college and the moving force behind whitcomb house , a dormitory for unwed single parents and their children . the six lively students have their fees , book and any incidentals including childcare paid for . the six students are also at the party but sarah becomes ill and falls into a coma ; she is rushed to the hospital where the doctors discover she was poisoned . they believe there was nicotine in the spicy drink she was having . a couple of days later another student is poisoned and is found in the house by one of the children . tiffany was wilder than sarah was and some of the mothers believe she was blackmailing someone . the case becomes personal when maggie 's office is trashed and someone tries to break into her home . to save whitcomb house maggie decides to see if she can discover who the killer really is . shadows on the ivy is very different from the other `` antique mystery '' book because this story concentrates on the heroine 's life as a professor while the other works showcased the protagonist as an antique print dealer . thus , this novel displays a completely different side of maggie that readers will like . lea wait has written an exciting and entertaining academic mystery that provides a whole different meaning to study time . harriet klausner
hi .. i would say most people should run , not walk , to buy this book . it does n't matter where you are starting from , everyone can benefit from this stuff , and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about . i found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money . i would recommend it to all my friends , especially those who are befuddled by the markets , because it has simple straightforward advice . good luck to all the savers and investors among us ! for socially conscious people , they also tell how to help society ( as well as get wealthy .
this video is a natural for a child . my daughter loves to watch the animals and has learned to recognize a variety of creatures from this dvd alone . i was thrilled to see they were limited to standard barnyard animals , and i love the upbeat music and the charming scenes ! it always holds my daughter 's attention and is great for soothing her from a bad mood , and also for thrilling her when she is already happy
i 'm a huge fan of edwin mccain , i 've had all his albums at least twice ( i end up losing them since i take them everywhere ) . this album is certainly not a disappointment . many of the songs will strike an emotional chord in the deepest of us , others are just good fun to listen to . there is more rock and roll style songs on this than many fans will be used to , but they 're all a blast to listen to . `` write me a song '' and `` i 've seen love '' are my favorites from this one . there are also a couple satirical songs - much like `` beautiful life '' from 'messenger . though 'messenger ' is still my favorite mccain album , i would never pass this one up . there is no reason why any edwin mccain fan would not like this one
i recommend this dvd for family viewing to everyone . my kids , ranging from <NUM> years old to <NUM> years old , still enjoy watching the series . since there is not much of a selection for family viewing on our local stations , we decided to create a dvd library . this was one voted by the kids as well as the parents to have . the three episodes included in this dvd edition are : ( <NUM> ) arthur 's lost library book-about arthur losing the latest scare-your-pants-off book from the library ; ( <NUM> ) d.w. 's imaginary friend-d.w. 's new imaginary friend , nadine , moves into the house and follows d.w everywhere , even to the amuzement park , much to arthur 's dislike ; ( <NUM> ) d.w. 's libary card-about d.w. getting her first library card .
there 's no point in repeating what others here have said . had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in rolling stone , i never would have known about this cd . it is a great , joyful rock album - i never even listened to the dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre . i 've worked backstage at stones , ac/dc and dead shows , and i modestly suggest that i know the real thing when i hear it . tear the shrink wrap off , baby , and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down , while the weather is still warm enough to do so ! if you 're a guitarist , pay attention to what syl is playing , and watch the video - he 's really learned to do it right
this album would have the <NUM> stars it deserves if it were n't for mr. feng nit-picking about technical stuff . if you do n't want all the extra versions of tunji you can go out to any music store and get the original version for $ <NUM> . `` out of this world '' is the most profoundly beautiful musical statement i have ever heard , from any artist , in any genre . that track alone makes it worth the price of admission .
as in many of his books , jack london enraptes the reader , but this time in a story of love . it is extremely refreshing because it shows the good side of true love without that sickening sweetness so many love stories have ... i read this book a few years back and read it again just recently . i am sixteen . this book is definetly one that many can enjoy , no matter your age
for many people they only think of mary martin or mitzi gaynor in `` south pacific '' so this should be a new and enjoyable experience . i love getting different performers takes on roles that is why i purchase so many different recordings of the same title . this recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings . it was really great to listen to this because i have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago . i think florence henderson is a natural for nellie forbush , i think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.so many people tend to just think of ms.henderson as that famous mrs.brady role . one shall be quite surprised . another surprise on this was giorgio tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as emile , it is a perfect match for ms.henderson 's in their duets . the rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of rodgers and hammerstein 's best scores . i think the best things about this recording is that this availability gives people more avenues to enjoy and explore this classic work
in spite of the complicated linux kernel architecture , this book can deliver a first glance but detailed information on each core part inside linux kernel . readers can easily understand it 's concepts after reading even without previous kernel development experience
rick moranis is adoreable , steve martin is appropriately sleazy , and ellen greene is a most unlikely heroine . taken as a whole , this movie is wonderful ... charming even . a definite must have for anyone who enjoys all things quirky but sweet
for an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing , this is a `` must read '' and a personal library staple . yes , the examples may be dated , but the concepts are still operable . you should read their `` positioning : the battle for your mind '' first . though based on von clauswitz ( set piece warfare ) , there is much to be learned . include sun tzu the art of war in your library as well . not that i have an opinion
a fun movie and not too scary for younger childre
this dvd is great ! i watched the first <NUM> seasons of the show so i could relate to the people in the video , because i saw how much weight they have lost , and how their lives have changed by getting fit . those who have never seen the show can still relate to the participants because you can see that they are working hard and struggling also . i have lost <NUM> pounds in <NUM> weeks by eating healthy and doing this video daily . i mix n match work-outs each day .
these recordings are journey to me . i was dissappointed when there music took a turn that seemed to represent a desire to make money which exceeded their desire to make music . i am elated to have found this `` album '' . it showcases the genius , soul and spirit which went into their music during that era .
i was in wal-mart and saw some scenes from this movie and instantly wanted to watch it . this is a very funny movie . it plays on all the ultimate dreams of children and some of us adults . the storyline is one of a kind . i am glad that pixar came out with this movie . i was especially intrigued by the youngest son . he made movie that much more enjoyable . so for anyone out there looking for a good family movie to watch and you hav n't already seen this one , than go and pick it up right now . you wo n't regret it .
this was my first jance novel . i enjoyed it immensely . i was surprised until the last page about `` who done it '' i learned some things about why people keep such large packs of pets . jance 's descriptions made me want to visit the desert . in conversation one evening to a person from the same area , i learned that her descriptions were indeed accurate . this wo n't be my last jance novel . hope the others are this good
i bought this book because i need it for my biochemistry class . the book itself is n't bad . it gave detail of how biological systems and chemical reaction affect each other
one of my favorite of gwynne forster . the story line is well written with affection and love . the characters demonstrate warmth and pride . whenever i need a pick-me up i reach for this book
this is , perhaps , the rolling stones ' masterpiece . after the disaster that was `` his satanic majesty 's request '' the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends ( and , one might add , following in the beatles ' footsteps ) . brian jones appears only sporadically , it 's his last album with the band . the stones brought in jimmy miller to produce , after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides mick and keith at the mixing board . nicky hopkins ' contribution to this album ca n't be understated . rumor has it that ry cooder participated in the sessions . `` sympathy for the devil '' kicks things off . for an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see jean luc godard 's `` one plus one '' ( aka `` sympathy for the devil '' ) . this song was scary and groundbreaking back in <NUM> - now that we 've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar . in my opinion this is one of mick 's best lyrics . `` no expectations '' is a beautiful song , with lovely piano work by hopkins . the lyric is a bit trite , but it works . believe it or not this was the first single - it 's perhaps the weakest song on the album . `` dear doctor '' is really , really funny . the stones were fans of country music , but here they take on the form as a cliche . `` for the gal i 'm to marry / is a bow-legged sow / i 've been soakin ' up drink like a sponge . '' this is a hoot . `` stray cat blues '' - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band . jeez , i hope not ! this is very creepy stuff . mick 's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy ( `` yeah , just do n't care ... '' ) . he sings this like an utter pervert , which is the point . `` well i can see that you 're <NUM> years old / but i do n't want your id . '' by now it 's obvious to the listener that the stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from ? it 's unlike anything we 've heard on previous stones albums . `` jigsaw puzzle '' - many fans do n't care for this song . it 's a bit of a throwback , somewhat reminiscent of `` something happened to me yesterday '' and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band . mick 's lyric is a bit overwritten , but the final verse in particular is quite good . the band jams out well here - keith , wyman and hopkins play off one another brilliantly , particularly in the coda . it 's a fine side-ender . `` street fighting man '' - some of this was recorded in a living room . the basic drums are charlie banging on telephone directory books . some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck . the sitar is brian ; more amazing hopkins piano here . this was , i believe , the start of keith using the famous `` open g '' tuning he has employed since . a solid song , but i 've always thought it a bit over-rated . `` prodigal son '' - country blues , based on the bible story . mick 's lyric is perfect , as is his vocal delivery . no contemporary british band could sound as authentically american when doing this style of blues . `` parachute woman '' - more blues , but now we move from the delta to the big city . bill wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite stones track . the sound is ( purposefully ? ) muddy , and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance . this is powerful stuff . `` factory girl '' - an underrated gem . it 's a beautiful song with a lilting melody , a fun yet poignant lyric , and a wonderful performance by all . `` waitin ' for a girl who 's got stains all down her dress / waitin ' for a girl and my feet are gettin ' wet / she ai n't come out yet / waitin ' for a factory girl '' - that 's as fine a depiction of working class life as i 've yet come across . `` salt of the earth '' - the first verse is keith richard 's first lead vocal on record . this is a stirring song , an apt followup to `` factory girl . '' i was n't at all surprised that this was a song mick and keith chose to perform at `` the concert for nyc . '' the vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship . if one is familiar with the rolling stones only as a `` hit '' group , this album could be disappointing - there 's no obvious top ten hit here . but if you appreciate music , and if you know anything about the history of this group , you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album . there is n't a bad track here . each is brilliant in its own way . and , of course , this was the first of five great albums produced by the stones - `` beggar 's banquet , '' `` let it bleed , '' `` get yer ya ya 's out , '' `` sticky fingers , '' and `` exile on main street . '' they had never before reached these heights - and never would again . the rolling stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of the beatles and bob dylan ( `` the holy trinity '' of the <NUM> 's ) on the strength of the five albums noted above . they had a lot of hits before `` beggar 's banquet , '' but if that was all they 'd done they would be regarded as equals to the animals or the yardbirds , etal . they became rock royalty when they produced `` beggar 's banquet .
i loved this movie even as a child but i only rememeber bits and pieces of it and i could n't remember the title and drove myself crazy trying to find it and finaly i did ! ! ! i 'm so happy
this film looked and sounded great . it was an angelina jolie movie but it just was n't what i expected . i come from the time were lara croft was controlled by your fingure tips so i do n't think they captured my lara croft tomb raider . it is still a film i have seen in standard and own in hd . the hd looks great . the film itself just did n't do it for me . they really did n't capture the essence of tomb raider
a cool fantasy action that will blow you away ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe not fast as dragon ball but is soo high budget ! ! ! i mean ... the animation is superb * * * * * ( the moves , destruction and fights were very realistic ) , the character desing is soo colorful ( just as seen in the cover ) , the graphics are pretty realistic , good story but very simple , bad english dub but not that bad , cool song at the ending credits and the camera moves were awesome ! ! i said that this anime is like dragon ball because there are to many `` hadukens '' , jumps that make look like the characters are flying and the story about the bad guy that want the ultimate power to conquer the wolrd but the good guys also can have the ulmate power to protect the world . but this anime is not that similar to dragon ball . i like the concept of the characters ... i mean ... each character have a diferent power , one with a cool spirit sword , other with a power whip , other with `` haduken '' and the last one with the control of a giant power dragon ! ! ! obiously this anime concentrate more on the action and not much with the story . i never saw the serie , so i do n't care what people say about the comparison to the serie . p.s : this anime is like pg-13 style or a saturday morning cartoon but do n't worry ! ! you will be sooo entertained that you wo n't care . adios .
not a fan of graphic novels or cgi , i was fully prepared to dislike this movie , but found it to be so well written , cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection . it 's a dark movie , subversive really , but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people , that one strong person with a will , determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them , can turn the tide . it 's a powerful message , and it 's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery , symbolism and script . bravo
following her deserved breakthrough with her last album evolution , martina mcbride continues her flirtation with the pop side of country with emotion , in which she delves further into her own brand of immaculately produced country ( pop ) , resulting in her least country album to date . fortunately , not only does mcbride have the voice to pull it off with ease , but the continuing transition she 's made over her last couple of albums towards pop is achieved seamlessly ( and not with the jarring , heavy-handed feel of faith hill 's inferior and overblown breathe ) . again , one of mcbride 's key strengths is her choice of material , which always manages to balance fun , somewhat lightweight tunes ( ' i love you ' ) with strong , well-written material ( 'love 's the only house ' , 'this uncivil war ' ) . as is typical , her vocal work is first-rate , particularly on the sterling ballad 'there you are ' , which she manages to salvage from being just another typical rumination on the wages of love . faith and shania should pay better attention -- this is how first-rate pop is supposed to sound
amazon has not done a good job sorting out the various editions and translations of marcus aurelius ' meditations . as a result , comments with many stars actually may be referring to an entirely different translation . likewise , hardbound references do n't match up with the paperback versions . i 'd recommend that you find a copy somewhere and look at the text yourself before you order .
remains of the day requires the viewer to be observant . anthony hopkins takes on the challenge of playing a man who is emotionally repressed and self-effacing , a butler who has complete , blind faith in his master and thinks only to serve him . hopkins is such a gifted actor that he can slip into the role seamlessly while still suggesting - so long as you watch closely - private emotions in this restrained and stilted figure . these emotions are often not fully understood by his character or dealt with properly , but hopkins puts them there - they might be revealed in a gesture of the hand , a jaw unhinging slightly , eyes lingering more than is strictly necessary . hopkins is simply fascinating to watch . he plays the butler stevens , who in the years leading up to wwii serves lord darlington in a grand english country house . stevens is loyal to his master ; he never questions him , never eavesdrops on his conversations , and assumes that his master has a great and complete understanding of the word . lord darlington , however , turns out to be a nazi appeaser ; he wishes to play it safe and make a deal with germany rather than go to war . he holds a gathering of like-minded noblemen and high officials in his house , where only one american politician , lewis ( christopher reeve ) , contradicts him and his policies of appeasement . when darlington asks stevens to remove two housemaids who are jewish refugees , stevens does so with some confusion but without argument . after all , his master understands more than he . he has to attend to the guests at the gathering , deal with his elderly father , an underbutler , who is growing too old for his duties , and handle the housekeeper , miss kenton , who has no problem contradicting stevens and disturbing what little private time he sets aside each day for himself . emma thompson plays miss kenton with honesty , intelligence , and vitality . the conversations between kenton and stevens often seem to be in some kind of code - on the surface they speak of housekeeping matters , or perhaps that sentimental book that stevens reads in private and attempts to conceal ... but matters of greater urgency are touched upon . stevens is affected by kenton , but seems immoveable as stone ; he has sacrificed too much of himself to his service , and he is couched in duty and routine . he can easily see if a single spoon is missing from the dinner table , but can not put words to his emotions , such as they are . would it ever be possible for him to change ? just as darlington 's loyalties were grossly misplaced and repented too late , perhaps stevens will also find himself only with regrets . remains of the day is a fine , moving , nuanced picture , with rich performances .
becoming x is great to listen to in almost any situation like get togethers , hanging around the house or whatever . <NUM> underground definately helps make the album and the two versions of the song are fabulous
i gave this video five stars because it is the only thing i 've seen yet that has actual moving pictures of the bonzo dog band . being that they were n't on tv in the us at all during the <NUM> 's , it is quite amazing to be able to see them here in all their original glory . i was completely open mouthed amazed with all of them . vivian of course was a major howl , but the rest of the lads were right up there with him . roger ruskin spear in particular was a major scream . rodney slater was a real oddity as well and legs larry was hilarious . so was neil . it was just so amazingly great to come upon this . like coming upon a time capsule . there is quite a bit of the bonzos throughout these shows . unfortunately , most of it is not done live , however it is fascinating to hear a lot of their songs in developmental stages . there is almost an hour and a half of bonzo material on these disks . there are no chapter stops except for the beginning of each show . there is no copy guard either , so it is possible to assemble all the bonzo clips on your own disc . this is what i did using a hard disc dvd recorder . it all worked out beautifully and made the purchase of these dvd 's very much worth it . as for the comedy bits with all the others on the show , well , there are a few things but it really is truly amazing how much improved things got when the pythons became the pythons . i bought this for the bonzos and it did not disappoint
this john lennon compilation is really good , except that i wish `` i 'm losing you '' had been included . other than that , it does a good job of showcasing his hits and then some . the sound is great and i 'd recommend this to anyone that just wants one , one-disc john lennon compilation
dvd good quality however some of the cartoons i do not care for specificall
pop the box and you see an egon schiele drawing , an attenuated early modernist nude wearing her anxieties on her skin . it 's a fitting visual reference , for the willowz are a nervous band , also a raw , ambitious , self-challenging , brilliant and perplexing one . they have great hooks , a gift for casually tossing off little bits of humor and beauty , and this timeless unselfconscious quality that 's easier heard than described . in the bland stew of indie rock , the willowz are a toothsome morsel . ( review from scram magazine # <NUM>
this and dark side of the moon are the most balanced records pink floyd has ever produced . just the right amount of sax , synth , drums , guitar , and vocals . the album is a little different than their ealier stuff as it has mostly a possitive sound to it , in other words do n't come from the wall listening to this without giving it some time . the only thing in question really are the `` a new machine '' tracks , which are certainly different , not something you would just jump into . will you ever like them if you do n't like them inittially ? probably not . but other than that , everything else is utter perfection for the style of music they represent . listen to this album a few times and trust me , you 'll love it
the late richard laymon 's book `` to wake the dead '' is about a mummy who comes to life to terrorize the los angeles community that is housing the egyptian exibit . also there is a strong side story about people being kidnapped and held as sex slaves somewhere . that is actually the creepier story . but the mummy one is really a dandy too . the mummy story is not my favorite horror theme ( and i did not like the stephen sommers/brenden frasier movies , either ) , but then it had never been presented like this . actually a lot of it was very h.p . lovecraft influenced ; mentioning of the evil ancient snake god set , the museum is named after charles ward , starting to see the resemeblence ? the characters were less than i expected . after reading `` in the dark '' i thought he would have some richly developed characters ; but i guess there were just too many to juggle to give them all proper time to mature . there were the kidnap victims , the blind woman , the runaway teenagers , the hedonist egyptian , the museum curator and her boyfriend ; i guess too many subplots and not really tied up effeciently . but this is still a great book , and i think any fan of horror will enjoy it
this is a great telling of the story of ruby bridges , the first african american child to attend an all-white new orleans school . the book does a very good job of explaining on a child 's level , what ruby went through and why . the book was written by a child psychiatrist who witnessed her going into school and being shouted at by the angry mob and met with to allow her an outlet for her fears and feelings . do n't give too much credence to the reviewer who slammed the book because of the `` pointless '' religious scene . the mentions of religion are not pointless because faith is what helped ruby and her family through this difficult time ... faith in god was part of who they were . furthermore , although the book does n't directly go into gory details about the things that were said to and about ruby , it clearly explains that the whites did n't want their children in school with ruby and why . no book is going to answer all a child 's questions on any subject , but this one is a great way to open up the lines of communication and a great way to introduce the subject . an interesting side note : according to ruby bridges web site , mrs. henry , her beloved teacher , was not rehired by william franz elementary school the following year . one must assume that her loving care of ruby and her refusal to subscribe to the racist views made her unwelcome
how many times have you seen the `` special edition '' label in a dvd cover ? many times i ` m sure , but that could mean anything . from new remastered picture and new digital audio to boring meanenless interviews , but what about real extras ? like deleted scenes , outtakes , i mean real material that realy interest the viewer , and in this cult film 's case , the fans ! because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism , we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on ! and this special edition brings you all that and more . not only typical extra written material , like filmographies and bios , here you can find all the audiovisuals that weren ` t used , tv trailers , movie trailers , commercials , interviews , and enough deleted scenes and outtakes to make a whole new movie of its own ! i mean everything ! fake interviews , presentations on tv shows , video clips , goofing-around trailers , a crazy audio commentary by the `` band '' during the film , you name it ... even the main page is commented by spinal tap ! ! ! ! in conclusion , a real deal , don ` t miss this edition . it ` s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material . amazing realy . of course the digital and audio could have been better , but the movie is so entertainning that you can pass that
linsey davis makes you feel right at home in roman britai
there was a big controversy earlier this year with `` the cary grant box set '' which is a great collection in its own right . many people were upset that it included the first release of `` holiday '' which was new to dvd ( unlike the other films in the collection ) , but no stand alone disc was being offered . well , good news . if all you wanted was `` holiday '' and you held out , here it comes ten months later . now , i 've always had a soft spot for `` holiday . '' it has n't achieved quite the classic status as a couple of other hepburn and grant pairings -- '' the philadelphia story '' and `` bringing up baby '' -- but i actually think that works to its advantage . i might get into trouble for this , but i somewhat prefer this to the more antic `` bringing up baby '' ( do n't shoot me , i know it 's a great film too ) . cary grant plays a carefree soul that becomes engaged to a millionaire 's spoiled , socialite daughter . he is expected to take life more seriously and responsibly -- but that 's not necessarily in his master plan . grant , as always , is charming -- the quips and physicality that were his trademark are used to good effect here . katherine hepburn , as the girl 's sister , is obviously a better match for him ! hepburn uses her rapid fire delivery and plays smart and wry better than anyone else in her era . of course , grant and hepburn have great chemistry and it 's a joy to see these two masters banter . there 's plenty of slapstick , but part of `` holiday '' 's charm is that it balances this with real romance . it 's funny and sweet . any fan of grant , hepburn , director george cukor , classics and/or screwball comedy needs to check this film out . it 'll make you smile . kgharris , 10/06
this is my seventh evans recording and it is like i am getting to know him all over again . this album has energy , freshness and joy that just is n't there on later recordings . the recording quality is more than satisfactory . the group 's playing is smart and engaging with a skillful balance between technical skill and understated musicality . the playfulness brought to standards like witchcraft is a welcome contrast to many of his later more brooding works . lafaro and motian provide their legendary support and interplay with their typcial flair . this was definitely a high point for evans , before drugs , bad health and personal problems got in the way . no evans collection would be complete without this recording
harry was one of the great trumpters . it was a pleasure to listen to his best works again
this movie has the realistic arts of violence with knives ( not guns ) . lt bonham ( tommy lee jones ) who is a military instructor who trained aaron hallam ( benicio del toro ) very well to become a killing machine . after the war experience aaron goes through in kosovo aaron can not seem to turn off his deadly technique skills of killing . now aaron gets out of control the cops ca n't stop him & opening fire at him wo n't help at all it just ends up with more casualties of cops and the only one who can stop him is lt which becomes a deadly cat mouse game and a gruesom battle between a teacher and a student which was a really good fight . this movie deserves 5/5 stars for good actors and a good storyline too .
dvd arrived quickly and it great shape will make a lovely addition to my keepsake collection
`` opium : a history '' by martin booth is an engrossing work of nonfiction that details human reliance on opium for thousands upon thousands of years and how it has affected us physically , emotionally , economically , and morally . the book starts with a discussion on the poppy flower itself and how opium is derived from the plant 's sap and ending on the efforts of international traffickers , government enforcement agencies , and doctors alike in either expanding or eradicating addiction to opium . in between , you will learn about opium 's horrible effects on the body , britain 's establishment of the opium trade in china and later efforts to destroy it ( counter to the rest of the world 's reliance on opium to support their economies ) , the transformation of opium to heroin , the use of opium to inspire artists around the world , and the quiet and insidious opium trade that goes on with the permission of many governments to support war efforts and other international issues . to me , the most fascinating thing i learned from this book was the amount of people addicted to the drug in the past because it was such an important painkiller/medicine and because it helped quiet fussy babies . you ca n't help finish this book and wonder if it is even possible to win a war against a drug that has shaped the lives of so many humans and so many societies for thousands of years . i personally found the book easy to read , though i preferred the first two-thirds of the book . this part of the book covered the drug itself , its health affects , and its early history up to the nineteenth century . i was n't as interested in the international trafficking part of the book ( the last one-third ) , probably because so many people , organizations , and countries were mentioned that i lost track of which country was fighting who and who was doing what with heroin or opium . still , the book is an eye-opening read . the excruciating description of opium withdrawal should be mandatory reading for high school kids to help stymie any attempt at trying the drug .
the article was well packed and arrived quickly . i like the service that is behind the ordering and shipping . it 's clearly service i shall use again
we love this whole series of dvd 's . our <NUM> month-old son never watches tv at home , but on long car trips , these are life savers ! the music is beautiful and soothing and the images are great . he loves the `` real '' pictures of children , animals , and nature scenes . we received the `` god of wonders '' as a gift , and have since purchased the other two . these are a great alternative to the einstein videos if you want christian music along with the videos
to appreciate this story , you have to believe that two people can meet and quickly fall forever into forbidden love . that is what is at the heart of this film . if you ca n't accept that premise , the movie simply does not work . and what makes it throb with life for me are the excellent performances of jeremy northam and jennifer ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us along . paltrow and eckhart are a secondary love story here , but you never feel that they really care for one another . worth your time if you are a romantic . ok , i 'm a romantic . sue me
i 've been waiting for this film on dvd for years ! thank goodness , it 's here and wo n't disappoint . clean crisp and sharp with great sound quality ! as a film it is a true piece of art with some of the best performances ever assembled ! i lived in waxahachie where much of the film was shot and was in the `` heart '' house as it is called . believe me , the cinematography in this film is worth the price of the dvd ! texas never looked better ! this film would make a terrific companion piece to `` the trip to bountiful '' which was also filmed around the waxahachie , texas area . `` places '' on dvd ! it 's about time ! now how about `` bountiful '' on dvd
this is movie is an excellent wwii prisoner of war film . i was enamored immediately and for the entire length of this film . william holden is perfect as an american pow caught in the middle between a mission dreamed up by his british companions and desire to sit the war out . director david lean is the master .
really nice dancing , with some innovative moves and choreography . the dancers are definetely top notch , just like their credentials would suggest . if do not want to watch another booooring and hokey ballroom show , this is the dvd for you . it ranks up there with `` shall we dance '' ( japanese version ) as a great dance dvd . the last samba number is amazing . if there is one thing i would change with the show , it is that it does not have enough latin dancing . i kept waiting in vain for another chacha and a good salsa or rueda , and nothing happened ( `` burn the floor '' guys - are you listening ! ? )
the sesame street folks have hit the jackpot again ! my daughter ( one year old ) loves this book . she enjoys flipping the pages and seeing cookie see , cookie do ! a must have for every parent and child
the ` preface ' by james roosevelt jr. says social security racks up surpluses as it had done for decades and will continue to do so . the special interests who want to `` reform '' social security really want to weaken or abolish it . so it is up to the american people to protect it in order `` to promote the general welfare '' . al franken 's ` foreword ' wastes its pages on comic comments . the ` introduction ' says bush 's scam would be both risky and costly , they use scary stories to fool people into believing their lies . most americans do n't trust bush ( p.4 ) . conason warns about the `` united seniors association '' created to scare people into sending them money ( p.5 ) ! powerful financiers want to destroy social security ( p.6 ) . they use phony fronts to fool people ( p.8 ) . complaints and lies about social security go back to <NUM> ; they have been proven false repeatedly ( p.10 ) . they ca n't learn and ca n't forget . here 's how this fraud would work . they promised a lucrative return on `` personal '' accounts but did n't tell that management fees and substantial risks would drain these accounts . they promised the owner of the account would control their money but did n't tell that choice would be limited . they promised these accounts would be inherited but did n't tell you this would need an annuity that would leave little to heirs . they promised that social security would go bankrupt but did n't tell you this contradicted their prediction of increased growth in the economy . heads they win , tails you lose . in the real world , people making these promises on investments would go to jail . chapter <NUM> explains when bush says he wants to `` strengthen '' social security he really wants to reduce benefits ( p.22 ) . conason neglects to tell that in <NUM> eisenhower promised to extend social security to the middle-class by including small business owners and farmers . he did this in <NUM> . there is no crisis in social security , and wo n't be if economic growth continues . if growth is slow private investments will suffer ( p.29 ) . chapter <NUM> tells about the various publicity groups formed to attack social security with lies and half-truths . conason names the corporations who pay for these advertising attacks . they simply lied about privatization ( p.49 ) ! billions were squandered by bush on tax cuts for the super-rich ( p.50 ) . conason explains the frauds of the privatizers ( p.56 ) . privatization was renamed `` choice '' ( p.57 ) . chapter <NUM> tells about the phony groups who either mislead people to try to defraud them . they make up `` facts '' to try to prove their case ( pp.67-68 ) . this chapter tells of their techniques to divide and conquer ( p.74 ) . the aarp opposed bush 's failed proposal , and described the essential elements for a retirement plan ( p.77 ) . aarp wo n't tear down the house because of a clogged drain ( p.78 ) . does the description of `` united seniors association '' on pages 79-83 expose their hidden agenda ? chapter <NUM> tells about the plans of wall street to swindle private accounts ( p.86 ) . private accounts are losers compared to social security ( p.89 ) . bush 's plan to privatize social security because of a lack of popularity ( pp.104-105 ) . `` you ca n't fool all of the people all of the time . '' social security was the best-working government program . the ` conclusion ' points out that bush has not provided an actuarially sound plan to deal with an alleged future crisis in social security ( pp.109-110 ) . the proposed change could not work . the projected outlook for social security over the next <NUM> years is reasonably good ( p.114 ) . [ the real problem is falling real wages and too high taxes . ] there are other real solutions ( p.117-121 ) .
if you have not seen this little gem based on e.m forster 's first published novel then you are in for a treat . an excellent story adapted to fit the screen perfectly with sublime performances from rupert graves and judy davis . a very fine series of moments . go ahead treat yourself to a bit of class
minus hails from iceland , the land of rocky tundra and quirky rock groups ( sugarcubes , bjork , sigur ros , mum , etc . ) none of which can hold a candle to meeting the intensity of minus . this is bar none the most unusual hardcore metal album i have ever heard and i 'm loving it ! yes it 's screamy ( well most of it ) , but it 's very melodic with tons of tempo changes to keep you on your feet . mainstream metal this ai n't and it is n't for the faint of heart . if you 're into slipknot and need a bit more attitude ( ! ! ) or more complexity and layers , this might be up your alley ! give it a try !

the almighty unearth has returned to us with a brand new ep entitled endless . picking up right where 'the stings of conscience ' left off , this massachusetts metal machine is ready to kick your teeth in once more . first of all the new material is more metal if you can believe that . the song endless could very well be the greatest hardcore song erver written . the track kicks off with susi and mcgrath going absolutly ape ... on their axes and trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written . the track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns i have ever experienced . awesome .... internal war is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from mike rudberg . the pace is fast as susi and mcgrath lead the way accompenied by phipps as he belts out words of truth : 'power in the wrong hands , our scaffold is destroyed , children killing children cuz the government has ignorned , i sling my arrow to shatter your walls , no more creating victims from ignorance ' . i loved the charm , because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something shadows fall may write . once again gutiars fly all over the place and trevor sounding like a psychotic madman . this is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad ... solos . the last track my desire also appeared on their full length . i for one do not really dig eps , but unearth is one of my favorite bands so i gave em a <NUM> . if you dig any european influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore , unearth is the band for you , and i for one can not wait for a new full length
this compilation has nearly all the tracks from american graffiti 's soundtrack , and so much more . this is exactly what i 've been looking to fit my eclectic taste . all the hits are here , this side of great balls of fire and willie and the hand jive . those two would have made this compilation perfect , but perfection is hard to come by when dealing with era compilations . i was n't around back when these songs were blasting on the radio , but i grew up listening to this music - thanks , mom ! if you want to experience the sound of this era , this three-set cd collection is perfect . i 've been looking for maybellene , be-bop-a-lula , peggy sue , sea cruise and blue suede shoes and they 're all here on the same set ! try ebay before you buy here . i found this set relatively cheap over there . there were about five sellers when i bought mine , all vying for the lowest price . this is great road music for those of you in my generation brave enough to try something new and break away from the death cab for cutie/outkast conformity we hear all the time on mainstream radio . for those of you who grew up on this stuff , please let me reintroduce you to your old friends . this cd has almost all of them .

let there be rock is an amazing album filled with smash hits such as `` whole lotta rosie '' and `` let there be rock '' . and other great songs like `` dog eat dog '' . this is a must-have album for anyone that likes classic ac/dc . <NUM> . go down- this song is okay , a pretty good rocker . 7/10 <NUM> . dog eat dog- one of my all-time favorite ac/dc songs . it has a catchy beat and a good chorus . 9/10 <NUM> . let there be rock- a classic rocker , this song tells the story of how rock came to be . 8/10 <NUM> . bad boy boogie- a mediocre song , gets kind of repetitive , but has a good bluesy feel . 7/10 <NUM> . problem child- a very catchy song , but why did they put it on here again ? it was originally on dirty deeds done dirt cheap . 8/10 <NUM> . overdose- this song 's kind of filler , but has good guitar . 7/10 <NUM> . hell ai n't a bad place to be- good song , just a plain rocker . 8/10 <NUM> . whole lotta rosie- funny song , and has good guitar . a little disturbing though . 8/10 this ac/dc album is almost like a ac/dc : greatest hits , because it has a lot of good songs on it . definitely something to have in your collection
i used the tape about <NUM> days a week and i really saw a difference in my body , especially my arms . i only did the toning portion . i felt silly doing the dance portion and i really do n't care for the music . other than that , i recommend this video for toning . i have also tried `` optimizer '' and `` strength and grace '' which are also very good and there is no dancing .

everyone , just once in their life has probably had fantasies of pistol whipping or perhaps even punching out at least one member of their family , but the embattled title character ethan mao , in maverick director , quentin lee 's saga of asian american gay dysfunctional angst gets to do this and so much more . a whole film about holding your family to ransom by gunpoint may not immediately strike viewers as the stuff of a great story , and may even be a little bit much for most , but lee manages for the most part to hold this film together , delivering up a tight , taught , if not terribly low budget package that mixes elements of the psychological thriller , coming-of-age drama , gay love story , and even black comedy . ethan mao is certainly overly ambitious in its themes and crude in its execution , but there 's a gritty and solemn earnestness to this movie , that lifts it above the usual dramas of teenage angst . what makes this movie worth viewing and so involving , and perhaps also so groundbreaking , is that it depicts a modern , urban gay asian-american teen , which is something that to my knowledge is very rare in film . the story takes off when the title character ethan mao ( jun hee lee ) has just been kicked out of his home after abraham , his father ( raymond ma ) discovered his stash of gay porn . his family is reasonably wealthy having worked hard over the years , now they 're the epitome of the immigrant success story . but ethan 's father has made the fatal mistake of putting money before the love of his family . now his days are spent catering to ethan 's gangly younger brother noel ( david tran ) , a bullying and spoilt stepson josh ( kevin kleinberg ) , and sarah , his slinky , narcissistic , ex-actress wife ( julia nickson ) . obviously being gay does n't sit well with mr. mao , so ethan is promptly ejected from the family and immediately - without exploring any other options - adopts the life of a homeless hustler , eventually meeting remigio ( jerry hernandez ) , who also works the streets . the pair develops a fierce friendship based on love , trust , and loyalty . remigio feeds ethan , gives him a home and surprisingly keeps his hands to himself . ethan , for his part has a lack of affect , which presumably signals an emotional numbness . ethan enlists remigio 's help to return to his home to pick up his belongings as well as a necklace belonging to his dead mother , but his family , who are supposed to be on a thanksgiving outing , come home . a vicious argument ensues , with the two young men holding the group hostage until the necklace can be retrieved from a safe-deposit box the next day . from here , the film mushrooms into an unlikely hostage melodrama , complete with guns , uneasy family dysfunction , along with lots of emotional recriminations . josh , the stepbrother hates ethan , and ethan hates sarah , the stepmother , while m. mao remains appalled at what his son is doing , but at the same time begins to regret the way he 's treated ethan , and the rest of his family . as the hours progress , ethan begins to enjoy his newfound power and uses it to tell everyone in the family , especially his uptight and highly traditional dad , exactly what he thinks of them and how he feels he 's been mistreated . meanwhile , remigio looks on , remaining a silent , and somewhat reluctant witness to the proceedings , and a loyal friend to ethan . ethan mao is clearly heartfelt and sincere- and an early robbery scene is particularly strong - but ultimately a facile script hampers the film , along with its low production values and its bargain basement , c-grade acting . it is also essential that the viewer feel some sympathy for ethan , but his decision to freely participate in the hustler lifestyle , when you know a boy as bright as he could do something else , makes it hard for us to really root for him . ultimately , he comes across as a bit bratty , spoiled , and sad ; he should learn to lighten up a little , even if he does have a mean father and a wicked stepmother . despite ethan mao 's obvious shortcomings , the film has an intensity and fervor that is impossible not to like . the film also works as an offbeat tale of love and friendship ; ethan and remigio , through no fault of their own , have become a couple of devoted urban hustler outlaws . thank goodness though , that we are subjected to only one of ethan 's elderly and flabby customers . mike leonard november <NUM> .
this has helpful stuff in it . i even went out and bought a stopwatch to time certain tasks to speed myself up , as this book recommends . but the time obsession is kind of ridiculous at times , to the point where you almost expect mr. mccormack to say , & quot ; if you could shave making love to your wife from <NUM> minutes down to <NUM> seconds , you 'd save so much time. & quot ; to get philosophical , abraham maslow wrote the seminal book toward a psychology of being where he writes of the & quot ; self-actualized & quot ; personality , that he considers the most highly evolved personality type , but who are less than <NUM> % of the population . one common trait amongst these extremely happy people is they often experience & quot ; peak experiences & quot ; where they feel immense joy and these experiences & quot ; trascend time. & quot ; these people lose track of time during these experiences ! ! ! ! now , it seems an obsession with time such as mccormack preaches would completely interfere with one 's ever having such joyful experiences . i suppose it 's like a lousy movie , where you are always looking at your watch , versus a great movie , where you forget about everything but the movie . so , i suppose to be successful and efficient , you have to say good-bye to happiness in a big way . but it 's success that is supposed to make you happy , right ? a major contradiction !
this is a great recording to say the least , but i have to say , stitt has played better . his work with bud powell and sonny rollins , i thought was better than this . that said , it is a classic . ammons is in top form , check him out on counter clockwise and blues up and down . there is a great sense of atmosphere , like you 're really there , with stitt hooting ammons along in his solos . the rhythm section is more than solid , and it should sit right up there inthe best of your collection
this is surely one of the greatest collections of 'linked short-stories ' ever written -- it matches calvino 's cosmicomics and borges ' labyrinths . lem is a total genius . a writer of playful little fables that are also philosophically profound ( and logically consistent ) . this book is a brilliant companion to lem 's the cyberiad , with which it shares many themes and ideas . lem has a beautiful style : he can make engineering terms sound poetic . his rigorously modern metaphors are as original as those of j.g . ballard , but more varied and lyrical . for lem , the periodic table is an unwritten poem . this book is the final and true ode , and each line is a fantastic , fabulous , incredible story . i give this book 200,000,000 stars . and that 's only because i 'm not feeling so generous today . it probably deserves a googolplex ( <NUM> to the power of <NUM> raised to the power of <NUM> to the power of <NUM> ) of stars . at least
i love john wayne movies and this one is a good one . with friend kirk douglas , wayne plays taw jackson a man sent to prison by bruce cabot for a crime he did n't commit and cabot stole waynes land and his gold mine to boot . now wayne is out and wants payback and the gold . douglas is lomax the gunman who cabot wants to hire to kill wayne , but wayne gets to him first and they become parters in an atempt to rob one of cabots gold shipments in the title wagon . and what a wagon , its armor plated , has a gatlin gun mounted on it and has <NUM> gunman on horse back riding beside it.this is a very action packed western that has humor to spare and wayne and douglas look to be having the time of their lives together and it just makes the movie pop off the screen with energy . my boys watch this one with me and i 've caught them outside playing like they are in the movie , so this is one of the best reasons i have to add this great western to the collection .
this classic is one that everyone should read and maybe even read every year ! !
''under a violet moon '' is a great cd for any blackmore 's night fan . lady candice 's voice is eerily haunting , yet comforting as well . ritchie 's miraculous guitar playing is perfectly blended with his wife 's voice . a beautiful masterpiece

i hightly recommend this book . an easy , quick read that could change your life
the title says it all . just throw all the tracks in a hat , and pick out a hit . so much emotion was drawn to each track you can feel it . for myself , this album represents tons of memories and great times . i suggest it to any and everybody
a <NUM> year old man , the mighty colorado and a solo journey from wyoming to mexico - how could anyone who has ever traveled by foot or raft not read and love this book . hats off again mr.fletcher
ok , now that i got your attention ... this is a great trip down memory lane for any of you star wars nuts that grew up in the late 70s/early 80s . remembering how things were back in <NUM> , i can see how this show managed to captivate me . no internet , no video games , no cable , vhs , dvd ... not a single luxury . like robinson crusoe , as primitive as can be . we had nothing else . even though as an eight year old , i knew this was kinda lame , it was an absolute godsend when there was only one tv in the house with a total of four channels . anyhow , stream of consciouness bullet list : - first season is great cheese and hot chicks , second season is horrid . - this is what star trek would have been if roddenberry had come around ten years later . - a gil gerard ( circa <NUM> ) versus william shatner ( circa <NUM> ) stagefight would probably put me into a coma due to it 's mind-blowing awesomeness . - ahead of even the great princess leia and the not-quite-as-great cassiopia , colonel deering and princess amadala are the two women who made me realize i was down with the ladies , if you catch my very blatant drift . nothing surpirsing here , but erin gray was my first crush . - twiki is not nearly as annoying as some stick-in-the-mud types would have you believe . his cheeseball comic relief works perfectly with gil 's cheeseball chest carpet and martial arts ability . - every scene involving `` dancing from the future '' or previously referenced martial arts is twenty times more entertaining that anything in the history of `` reality tv '' . - hawk is not an interesting character , he is just the least crappy thing in a completely crappy second season . - there are no extras at all , pretty dissapointing given the price point and the target audience of sci-fi geeks who thrive on that kinda stuff in conclusion : i miss the days when sci-fi did n't have to beat you over the head and then strangle you with nothing but dread and darkness and doom . buck rogers takes place in post-apocolyptic , nuclear wasteland , mutants living in the desert , planet earth ... and it 's still a hundred times less depressing than any of the cookie cutter sci-fi series plopped out in the last ten years . of course , we are a much more critical society nowadays ... plumped up on years of cable networks , easily accessible vhs/dvd movies and other competitors for our time . long gone are the days of shows like this . shows where everybody involved , audience included , knew it was escapist/fantasy crap but just went along and had fun with it . gil gerard is an absolute joy to watch just because you always knew he was in on the joke ( at least during the first season ) . everybody takes themselves too seriously nowadays , especially sci-fi . the new battlestar series is so painfully self-aware it 's basically a soap-opera that happens to be in space . anyhoo ... if are a male sci-fi fan who was between the ages of let 's say ... <NUM> to <NUM> ... when this series made it 's run , go out and buy it . for better or worse , buck rogers took me back to the late 70s much more effectively than star wars or battlestar . 4/5 only due to the complete lack of extra
i ca n't believe the only <NUM> bad reviews were given by people who di n't know the book was written in spanish . i read the book and i personally give it <NUM> stars for its historic content among other things . first , the title is written in spanish , not german nor english ! ! ! second , if you feel the vendor did n't provide an accurate description of the book such as the language edition do n't blame the book . further , if you want to blame somebody because you ca n't read the book , blame the editors for not publishing an english version . not all books are translated into english and viceversa . third , for those who wrote the bad reviews give yourself <NUM> stars for publicly admitting that you were careless/stup .. enough to buy a book that you could n't read . under the editorial reviews you have this note : language notes text : spanish i hope this note helps for those would be buyers . gracias .
after reading the many lukewarm reviews here , i did n't have very high expectations for this dvd of a <NUM> documentary produced in part to hype the lost in space motion picture released around that time . but after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s dr. smith and will robinson in character circa <NUM> , i knew i had to have this . turned out the documentary itself was n't half as bad as i had been dreading . in fact i 'd say overall it 's pretty decent . yeah , so john laroquette is irrelevant to lis , but i 've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter ( -- hell , bill mumy himself sometimes acts as host of biography ) . at least laroquette was n't particularly irritating here like he could have been . maybe if you 're a hardcore lis fan who has read every book and article available on the subject , then there probably wo n't be much new here for you . but as someone who always enjoyed the show but has n't really gotten into the fandom side of things , this documentary was just right for me and i picked up many a new fact here and there ( eg . : john `` star wars '' williams did the music for lis too ? i did not know that . and the guy who did the robot 's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit ? i did not know that either . ) it was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in <NUM> and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since . i also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic lis with more background info on the show . it really helps to show them how important this show is to many people ( yes , i am not a freak for liking this ! ) , and why . after watching this , they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance . bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers ( now also available on one of the lis tv show dvds ) , some sfx footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show 's pilot ( i was surprised it was in colour . did they shoot all the b & w shows in colour first ? ) , and guy williams ' screen test for irwin allen to get the part of prof. john robinson ( my squeaky-clean image of prof. robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when williams seems intent on revealing to irwin allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at . gah ! ) but the real highlight here is of course the scene with will and dr. smith . both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set , and the jupiter ii mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too . the scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly , but i have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them . it will be the last , unfortunately , due to the death of jonathan harris just months after . i really wish they had done more like this and sooner , but i guess something is better than nothing .... so for me , this disc was the perfect way to complete my lis dvd collection . just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the space <NUM> dvd megaset , it adds that last little something extra that 's really nice to have . i think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print , so grab it while you can . ( -- and for any people reading this from the dvd-making biz , howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow `` family feud '' that they mention in this documentary , where the cast of lis were guests ? i 'd buy that !
this film genuinely surprised me when i first saw it in theaters in <NUM> . for me , bridget fonda was the main draw at the time , as she received top billing and was on the movie posters with matt dillion . it felt like a bait and switch , because the film focuses more on campbell scott and kyra sedgwick 's relationship , even though they are n't featured on the poster . that 's no biggie , because i enjoyed their storyline much more than bridget and matt 's ... but i bet campbell and kyra were n't happy to be excluded on the poster/dvd cover . this film has it all ... great music suitable to the period ( grunge/alternative ) , fantastic use of place ( seattle in a starring role ) , interesting and quirky characters , and true to life portrayal of young people in their twenties negotiating through life as they find their true passions . i especially loved campbell scott 's performance and he is the true star of this film . his job is working on creating a `` super train '' to get seattlites out of their cars and onboard for their commute , because he believes that `` if you give them great coffee and great music , they 'll ride . '' his girlfriend , played by kyra sedgwick , has her pulse on the masses , by telling him , `` i still love my car , though . '' she 's an environmentalist who drives an old gass guzzling clunker of an automobile , which campbell pokes fun at after a lunch date . its a joy to watch their relationship grow from initial doubts to lover games about how soon after a date one should call to other challenges that crop up . i especially love the scene when linda ( sedgwick ) peruses steve 's ( campbell scott ) record albums and gets nostalgic about her college days . that scene epitomizes the exciting `` getting to know you '' stage of dating and rings absolutely true . the choice of music in that scene , and throughout the entire movie really enhances the scenes overall . probably the only thing i did n't like about the film , which is just a tiny critique , was janet 's ( fonda ) almost groupie-like infatuation with cliff ( dillon ) , who did n't seem all that interested in her ( until she moves on with her life ) . they are a mismatched pair if there ever was one ... janet with her ambitions for grad school to pursue architecture , and cliff the stereotypical gen x slacker working menial jobs to support his rock band career that probably would n't have gone anywhere . janet should have hooked up with the plastic surgeon who does n't know how to have fun ! this dvd would be made even better with a director 's commentary track . cameron crowe could divulge a lot of interesting information and insite jokes that the average filmwatcher might not catch ( like when the mime says , `` wooo woooo woooo '' in response to a guy who says he works for boeing , or when a reporter asks cliff what the song `` touch me , i 'm dick '' is about -- which is an inside joke on the actual song `` touch me , i 'm sick '' ) . this film is so ingrained into the grunge culture of seattle of the early 1990s , that future audiences could use a lot of background info a director 's commentary would provide . at any rate , this film is a joy to watch , and cheaply priced that it 's worth having in one 's collection . and buy the soundtrack while you 're at it
it had been way too long since i picked up a heinlein title : `` stranger in a strange land '' being the last time i ventured into his densely written world <NUM> years ago . the book touts that this is `` science fiction 's most controversial novel '' ... and i can see that since it was written in <NUM> . however , the disturbing elements of slavery , incest , and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time . as for the storyline , it is inetersting and well put together . this book seemed to me like two stories in one . the first half could be entitled `` the survivalist guide after the complete destruction of the world as we know it '' and i shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the ( un ) liklihood i ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods . the story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future earth . the `` color war '' has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves . this new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works . our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities . i do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about farnham 's clan . it is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world : leaders , fighters , followers , cowards , dependants , etc . the strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot ( even learn to like it ) . the time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title `` sci-fi '' . other than that , it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction . if you can muddle through the first half of the book , dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin , you 're in for a good read . this book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more .
on this cd ella and louis armstrong join forces to make an album that is pure magic . they 've been lovingly teased as satin ( ella ) and sandpaper ( louis , because of his gravelly voice ) ; but no duo compares to them when they sing together . louis and ella obviously enjoyed making this recording ; their voices are in excellent form and impart a certain sense of genuine happiness that is hard to find . ella and louis have voices that are rich , vibrant and full of electricity ! this cd proves it . the cd starts off with the charming and playful `` let 's call the whole thing off . '' the album then switches gears and goes into the more soulful love ballad entitled `` our love is here to stay . '' sublime ! other great songs on this cd include `` stars fell on alabama ; '' `` the nearness of you ; '' `` stompin ' at the savoy ; '' and `` tenderly . '' louis performs great trumpet solos on songs including `` tenderly '' and `` summertime '' that make your heart melt . in fact , every song is special on this cd ; i also admire their rendition of `` under a blanket of blue . '' the musical arrangements are very well done . these tracks feature several great opportunities for us to enjoy armstrong 's trumpet solos . the liner notes impress me , too . there is an adaptation of an essay by william ruhlmann who wrote the liner notes for the complete ella and louis on verve . there are beautiful photos of ella and louis ; and you get the song credits , too . a nice plus ! overall , the chemistry between ella fitzgerald and louis armstrong makes for an experience that is truly in its own league . they enjoy their work and it shows . you will appreciate their energy and powerful renditions of these wonderful songs . i highly recommend this cd for fans of classic pop vocals and fans of both ella and louis . this is also a great budget priced cd for people who want to know if they will like this style of music . moreover , if you do like this cd i suggest you listen to the cd box set entitled the complete ella fitzgerald & louis armstrong and another cd entitled ella and louis again . you can also try solo cds by both ella fitzgerald and louis armstrong ; they produced great music individually as well . you truly ca n't go wrong with this classic cd ; and i hope this cd brings you the same joy and thrills that ella and louis communicate when they perform these magnificent songs . enjoy ! ! !
i remember that the original movie made me cry but nothing could prepare for this remake . the movie was emotionally gripping and compelling . i cried hysterically through the last half of the movie feeling the pain and disappointment that the young piccolo was going through . i was impressed by the way brian stood strong and full of faith all the way up to the end . i thought that both actors did an incredible job , but i was most impressed with sean maher 's performance . he was believable as the care-free loving husband and competitive spirited football player . this movie really is worth your time , and i can guarantee you that at least one tear will be shed for this tragic and compelling story
this cd is true poetry , full of metaphor and metonymy . i have never become tired of listening to this poetry , the evocative moods and desolate yet soulful landscapes of loneliness . the pieces are timeless quality , and its musicality provides a backdrop for the lyrics rather than being intrusive . truly a remarkable work of art
energy=hot hot heat ! this album is full of it , though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments . with catchy melodies thougout the album , though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says , you 'll be sure to enjoy this alternative ' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance , dance ! ! , that is all hot hot heat makes you want to dance , besides that , they also have other songs like `` elevator '' and `` jingle jangle '' to tone down the album . this whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member , but newly found one , being a great addition , and being in love . so to dance and sing get this album .
as a designer in the new york metropolitan area , i thoroughly appreciate the effort that must have gone into making this book , and in particular its illustrations . they are detailed , accurate ( as far as i can tell ) , and above all informative in a way that infrastructure diagrams from other books are not . it is noted that tw : aoac 's lead designer found inspiration in a chance encounter with famed statistician/graphic artist edward tufte - a credible claim , if this book is any indicator . conveying so much about the city yet basking in white space , these spreads are consistently excellent . ascher 's writing , too , is impeccable , and while a free-market standpoint is appropriately engaged in her commentary , the invaluabity of new york 's public bureaus is not given short shrift . indeed , where politics have clouded issues of development for the city , ms. ascher has deftly surmised the issue and given it full and fair treatment . as a major in economics and a professional graphic designer , i am happily forced to recommend this book
it 's relatively easy to get someone to make a single purchase from you . but how do you instill that long-term loyalty and love that causes people to refuse to buy from anyone else ? ben mack talks about that and many other branding issues in the book think two products ahead : secrets the big advertising agencies do n't want you to know and how to use them for bigger profits . it 's an unconventional book that does n't mince words ... contents : pool hall wisdom ; brand misinformation versus back-end thinking ; the common thread and thinking two products ahead ; branding ? be good to your gander ; branding processes are strikingly similar ; what 's a brand essence ? ; legendary branding ; extracting a brand essence ; the kama sutra of marketing - five basic positions ; framing to the right target audience ; structured creativity - framing tools ; creativity on demand - why ad agencies ca n't brainstorm ; feed their passions ; plan to have many conversations ; everything communicates ; storytelling - letting the genie out of the bottle ; branding and thinking two products ahead ; myth , magic , and making money the old-fashioned way ; aks ; jeff lloyd 's secret to commercial residential real estate sales ; how to turn every first sale into a residual stream of income ; direct response branding ; acknowledgements ; index mack states that successful branding comes when you start thinking two products ahead of the current sale . in other words , you need to be thinking about the overall story and impression that your company and product leaves with a customer . this collection of legends and perceptions defines your brand , not the cute logo or corporate colors you stick on your products . what that means is that you * have * a brand whether you think you do or not . you need to bring your customer into the `` marketing funnel '' , which is a four stage process : intrigue , consider , interested , and buy . when you get them to buy , then the `` two products ahead '' mindset turns them from one-off buyers to loyal customers . it 's all a matter of managing your brand ... the story that your customers tell about your company and product . this book started off as an e-book that the author marketed himself ( for a much higher price ) . his style of writing and communication is frank and blunt , with no room for dancing around an issue . as such , it 's a lot of fun to read . since i do n't have a marketing background , i found it a little difficult to keep the finer points of marketing vs. branding vs. selling straight at times . but overall , i got the message that your brand is a priceless asset , and it 's important to do everything you can to make sure that brand says the right thing to your customer . a valuable read for any business , but especially for the small business owner who does n't think he has a brand ... he does .
a fun introduction to foods that we do not usually think of as comestible . no recipes for newt eyes though , but there are recipes for mice , rats , grasshoppers and pretty much anything else that can creep , crawl or walk . people in other parts of the world make do and enjoy many items that may be very tasty which we would abhor the thought of even eating , even when faced with starvation . french fries and hamburgers are n't everything
this is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics ... the cd has <NUM> tracks and clocks in at about <NUM> minutes this shocked me at first when i put the cd into my pc yet then i realised throughout every minute of the cd it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it , this is where the cd 's charm lies in it 's bubble gum pop punk rock . it 's fun , it 's lighthearted it 's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ if you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly , which is also nice they included the dvd with it so you can see the videos which show off the band 's true vision . if you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk , or something completly differnt , then you found it . who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme , sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album ?
* * this cd is really my favorite , even above the fred and mary mary . also even above the mass choirs , this cd is my favorite because of its closeness and realness to me . not only does canton jones get you crunk , but you can realy feel the lyrics because of their truth and accuracy in this generation . you ca n't help but be lifted , be drawn , and get `` bout it '' for christ !
this is one of my favorite releases from common . this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers . songs like i used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop . not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks . this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio
great old standards and some new stuff thrown in from jolly ole england . wonderful selection and performance . great addition to holiday collection
this movie is really fun because they mixed everything all around and made it confusing . pay attention the other person is right . this movie is for people who like art movies . it is violent . some people can not follow it , but those who do love it . i really loved it . it is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off , but it is really great . this is one you have to think with and pay attention to . this is not something to walk in and out of . it would not make any sense at all . not one for kids . they will be really confused . it will take so long to explain it to them and still you may not be able to . a smart teen could probably understand it , but some adults can not . if you are reading reviews i am sure you can . it is some great mental exercise and so much better than other movies when you want something of more substance
i only discovered edgar rice burroughs by accident a couple of years ago when i picked up a copy of this book `` just because '' . it turned out to be far better and far cooler than any expectations i might 've had . if you think you know tarzan and have n't read this , i 've got news for you . you do n't know tarzan . he 's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character . he 's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path . i 'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago . it 's so graphic and unapologetic for tarzan 's bestial nature . that said , there are a few small flaws . elements of the plot can be a bit contrived , but since it usually serves to get to more action , i can forgive that . burroughs 's writing , while still engaging , is a little stilted by today 's standards . and it does n't end with tarzan getting jane . that 's the story of `` the return of tarzan '' . not ending in a book always bugs me . i hate cliffhangers . i do n't need to be blackmailed to read the next one . you can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others . still , even the great edgar rice burroughs loses a star for this flaw because i really hate cliffhangers . sorry , eddie . do yourself a favor and pick this up . it might ruin you for other so-called adventure stories , but it 's worth it
this dvd is great , this dvd shows the real tupac just like the other reviewers said .. one thing puzzled me this whole time ever since tupac got murdered .. is he dead or alive ? ? i 've been putting alot of thought into this .. i came to a conclusion , but i 'm not really sure .. my conclusion is that he could still be alive .. after he got shot he was of course rushed to the hospital , then some how he survived the shots , then after that he probably told the fbi or the cops or whatever that he does n't want the public to know if he 's dead or alive , the reason to this ? ? i think because if the public knew then of course the gangsters that put this whole murder plot up would know too .. this way the gangsters dunno if he 's dead or alive so they cant do anytin anymore about tupac .. tupac is probably livin in a paradise sum where in this world far away from the public and the fbi is probably supportin him by giving him food and all that stuff ... of course my theory can probably be wrong .. i guess god will only know & amp ; the fbi ..
this is one of the best albums i have ever heard . there 's no songs on here that i do n't like . all of them are great . especially i 'm just a kid , i 'd do anything , and perfect . i reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as yellowcard , the all-american rejects , and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too
i can not laud this book too highly . it is meticulously researched and intelligently presented . you will be astounded . stunned , maybe . did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in boulder , co ? can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the world trade center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose iv bottle was attracting soviet bombers ? well , you will if you read this . and that 's just the start
when i heard that ecw was coming back full-blown and in its entirety i knew i had to review the best ecw show ever put on , and without a doubt one of the best ppv 's put on under wwe 's name lance storm vs. chris jericho - one of the best openers i have ever seen , these two just mesh so well , and that 's mader completely obvious when you watch this the two dropkick spots are great but the ending makes you feel like you 've been cheated 8/10 super crazy vs. little guido vs. tajiri - excellent way to follow up the opener there are spots galore in this m atch with the top one obviously being crazy 's balcony moonsault this match has a lot of run-in 's but that does n't hurt it that much 7/10 psicosis vs. rey mysterio - i 'm kind of in the middle on this match , as its nowhere near as good as some of the stuff they have put on before it is still a solid bout with a great legdrop spot rey picks it up with the help of the <NUM> ( boo ) 6/10 sabu vs. rhyno - this starts right after rvd 's heart-felt promo , this was a little bit of a let-down although sabu ca n't be expected to do everything anymore , kinda feels slow and dragged-on even though it is only <NUM> minutes and that 's never good , great finish 5/10 eddie guerrerro vs. chris benoit - technical masterpiece , with both men using great ring psychology , only complaint is that just when it kicks into high gear it ends but that 's one complaint over one great match 8/10 tanaka vs. mike awesome - wow , is the only word that comes to mind when viewing this match , that and ouch , it is just a spot-fest but what a brilliant spot-fest it is where the action never lets up for a second , withouty a doubt motn 10/10 dudleyz vs. sandman & tommy dreamer - this had to be on the card , although it is not my cup of tea , it is still a very good match , the teaming of sandy and dreamer works like a charm and creates some funny moments 6/10 all this action is capped off by the trashing of eric bischoff , so i do not know how it could have gotten any better , great climax to a great nigh
rivka simmons ' voice is very soothing and encouraging , but her `` meditations '' have been only so-so helpful in easing my `` stress '' . track <NUM> , `` body scan relaxation '' continues to leave me baffled . ( * how * am i supposed to `` breathe '' from my feet ? ) track <NUM> , `` progressive muscle relaxation '' has been more helpful
i bought this book for my 1st-grade daughter and she loves it ! each time we read this book , she selects a new favorite first lady . it is not the best history book ever written , but it has sparked a young childs interest in history and learning about our country .
the title says it all : sugar & spice . it 's a sweet yet sour comedy about the a-squad cheerleaders and their sister-like friendship as they all unite to help the head cheerleader , diane ( played by adorable marley shelton ) and her quarterback boyfriend support the twins they 're expecting . i watched this movie not knowing anything about it , and i honestly thought as soon as diane learns she 's pregnant and gives her boyfriend the news , that he was going to leave her , but he could n't have been more happy . in fact , the only people upset with the news are their parents who disown them , leaving the young couple to fend for themselves . they marry and take minimum wage jobs to pay for their apartment and the expected twins , but it 's not enough . but that does n't stop the a-squad from coming up with a heist plan sure to give the couple the cash they need to care for their babies . told from the point of view of a bitter b-squad cheerleader , this is one of those fun movies like mean girls that 's funny yet sweet without being too sugary . it will leave you cheering for these good bad girls the entire way . enjoy ... this one is definitely a keeper
what a combo . when this movie was made , depp was emerging as a truly great actor , alongside the great al pacino . fantastic
wow , what a trip back in time ! as i listen to this album , i am immediately transported back to my brother 's car , listening to olivia scream like a banshee on `` please do n't keep me waiting '' . certainly , the cover art , along with the release of `` grease '' earlier that same year ( <NUM> ) , made an impression on my 13-year old mind - but now that i 'm a mellower , <NUM> year old , i still am astounded by the quality of this album . great music , track after track . my personal favorites are `` please do n't keep me waiting '' , `` borrowed time '' , `` dancing round and round '' , and `` boats against the current '' . as for `` boats '' , eric carmen should be very pleased with the fine treatment that olivia gave this beautiful song of his . sadly , as of my writing this in nov , <NUM> , the cd is still only available as an import - what a miscarriage of justice ! anyway , it 's worth the effort to secure a copy - thanks to amazon for making it available
you can read about this movie on all the other reviews . i have nothing to add ! i want to promote the <NUM> videos that helped me really start to dance like this though ! how to do the robot and step-by-step , both available on amazon . check em out so you can dance like they do in this movie !
i purchased this book as a good primer for entering banking ( specifically indymac bank ) . when i joined retail banking ( previously only having worked in investment banking at morgan stanley ) i was able to expand my knowledge on various areas of the retail banking beyond just what i-banking had taught ( e.g. , , valuation , sec ii & sec iii stat techniques , tax implications and flippying and insider trading tips of how to find/negotiate the best properties ) . i would highly recommend this book to others in this field . - jameson thottam
this is a nice cd to bring back more soothing and romantic music . wanted a more diverse collection to add to my currect cds .
i ca n't rate this one highly enough . it 's certainly in a vein with his last couple , but , as has been oft noted , it 's more political and full of social commentary . some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones , as a result . i expected to have that reaction , but i found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all , and rodney melds them well with his more personal insights , which ultimately predominate in the end . also , focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun , like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the notorious cherry bombs . by the way , if you like this album , you may want to pick up the book `` rednecks & bluenecks : the politics of country music . '' it 's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and americana . and rodney shows up prominently throughout the book ; there 's a whole section just about this album
yep , it 's another romantic comedy ... with a twist . enter an account exec who , thru an accident w/ a hairdryer at home can hear women 's thoughts . this is a pure bunk , pure enjoyment film .. and mel gibson addresses it with style . while the film may not win any big awards , it 's great fun to watch again and again . and i 'm not one who 's big on romance comedies . want to grin and chuckle thru the evening ? give this one a look . suitable for the whole family , but it 's likely that kids under <NUM> will find it boring . recommended . ~ p
the album is straight raw . kurupt 's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with daz 's delivery . the g-funk beats are the best they 've ever sounded . as a whole , you will not skip one song at all . a+
thsi album is amazing , they use simple household noises and make it into music , these people are geniuses ! this album sounds great , it 's very insturmental . it 's like a clash of noises and happy , cuddly things , and dreamy stuff ! it really gets you thinking .
i have never taken the time to write a review on a book that i have purchased from amazon . thanks to all of you who do . this time was the exception . this book is incredible ! every recipe can be tailored to your stlye of breadmaking . it has directions for a bread machine , mixer , or the old fashioned way . i have tried a half dozen of the recipes so far and they are all delicious . my compliments to the author . the money has been well spent . thanks
so not only is this a great play by shakespeare but it 's also an easy version to read right along side the original text . no need to get out the old dictionary for those words that you stumble across trying to guess the actual meaning of because it 's right there next to you . this does n't take away from the play at all either . speaking of the play , this is a wonderful romance that reminds us how naive people can be if they are n't exposed to all of the harsh realities of life . the lady in this play practically falls in love with the first man she lays eyes on that she has n't grown up with ! it may have something to do with the magic that her father possesses . better yet , it has everything to do with her father and the spirits that are under his spell . after you 're done with the book , try to find a live performance of this play
a treasure for all welles ' fans . a <NUM> minute documentary on the failure to complete & quot ; it 's all true & quot ; leads into a full presentation of the beautiful <NUM> minute b & amp ; w silent drama documentary titled & quot ; four men on a raft & quot ; . an excellent modern ( stereo ) score made up of renditions of the brazilian music welles was investigating is dubbed on together with appropriate sound effects ( wind & amp ; waves etc ) . despite being on nitrate film stock stashed in a studio basement for over <NUM> years its presented in almost perfect condition . a thrill to see what 's left and truly sad to think of what might have emerged . included amongst the snippets of incomplete material is just <NUM> minutes b & amp ; w and <NUM> minutes colour rio carnival footage and a complete <NUM> minute segment from & quot ; my friend burrito & quot ;
as a fan of bobby darin , it was a treat to hear him perform in the old las vegas . the way entertainment should be in any venue . because of the 100th anniversary of las vegas , the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event . do n't miss this one of a kind cd
first off ; i really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least <NUM> minutes of play time and do n't cut out lengthy guitar solos . this cd certainly delivers in this regard as ronnie earl and the duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid <NUM> plus minutes . this is a close <NUM> star recommendation but it is n't a classic and it is n't groundbreaking ; although i would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point . it 's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another . highly recommended .
i will agree with some that this work can often be confusing in tacitus failure to fully explain new characters as they suddenly appear as if from no where , but the narrative is smooth , never tiresome , and it must be considered that it was written more than a thousand years ago and has been left to us in a mutilated form . despite these small drawbacks tacitus is still rome 's greatest ancient historian and the greatest stylist in the latin language
i had heard about the south beach diet <NUM> years ago through my mom and dad and sister . they all follow it and i thought i could n't do it because i was nursing my baby . i wish i had tried it sooner ! ! ! you can do this diet while pregnant/nursing and no matter what your health situation is ! my physician said it is the only diet he will encourage people to follow . it will work , it just takes a little discipline in the beginning ( phase <NUM> ) . you get through that and it 's easy street . i started the diet on march 1st , <NUM> weighing <NUM> lbs . and a size <NUM> . i weighed myself this morning and am down to <NUM> and a junior size <NUM> . i am <NUM> ' <NUM> '' so i am technically well within my ideal weight range , but i am shooting for 140lbs . i know it will happen any day now . i am in phase <NUM> and i eat dessert ( in moderation ) , bread ( whole grain ) and lots of yummy dishes ! ! ! i 've even got my kids cooking in the kitchen with me and they eat foods you 'd never believe a little kid would eat . it 's a family plan and a way of life . i 've got so much more energy that i want to exercise any chance i get now ! my whole family is healthier and happier for it . i do recommend reading both books -- read them over and over ... i 've read the south beach diet <NUM> or <NUM> times . when you feel a little down or like you 're falling off the wagon , read it . it will reaffirm what you 're doing and why you 're doing it . try it , you 'll like it ! good luck~~juli
hank snow is great on this cd . he and his band found rhythm that will make you want to get up and dance with this cd . this is a `` happy '' cd
another gem from ahc , diva . it 's no wonder she 's won nyc 's own `` american idol for the pros '' ( the mac award ) an astonishing <NUM> times ! miss callaway 's recently released `` blues in the night '' gifts listeners with an impressive range of songs encompassing depth and breadth of the human experience . she has , to say the least , mastered vocal performance . her magnificent vocal quality , interpretations , phrasing , intonation , time and choices are always spot on . her range is , as the youngsters say , sick . just a few of the highlights of this project are cole porter 's `` it 's all right with me , '' stephen sondheim 's `` no one is alone , '' as well as several new ahc originals ! and , the hauntingly beautiful `` spring can really hang you up the most . '' the title cut gives those of us who did n't get to see her tony-nominated performance in `` swing '' a chance to dig `` blues in the night '' over and over again . and speaking of broadway ... the duet here with sister , broadway favorite liz callaway , rates a bravo-standing-ovation after each listening . this cd recharges the soul 's spirit , so often chipped away by day-to-day challenges and , of course , the blues
insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies , and the consequnces they can produce . it is very well acted on both pacino 's and williams part , and swank was brilliant as well . besides all that good stuff , i am also a fan of the director , `` ever since i saw batman begins '' and find his artistic vision to be incredible . the only problem i had with this movie was the ending . sure , it showed how lying could defeat a person , but i thought a little redemption would have been nice . however , if you have a strong stomach , or a good editing company , i suggest you see this .
this informative and influential book has made me re-address my goals and improve my approach toward safety . i believe it will also help me become a more effective safety professional . i will encourage other safety professionals within my company to read this important resource , so that we may all begin the positive transformation
basically diamond baratta design is a lovely picture book - if you are a decorator or decorating your own home it can be a good source of inspiration or at least a few ideas .if just a fan of decorators it might disappoint as there is little substantive background information about their careers and philosophy . a good mate to this volume would be a book about dorothy draper as the diamond baretta team follow through on many of her ideas about color and scale .
this book is a great resource for all aspiring competitive runners . however , do n't confuse this book with glover 's other book - which is more for beginning and non-competitive runners . there is a lot of overlap between the two books , so there is not much point in buying both . however , i can see a beginner outgrowing the beginner book and wanting the extra info that the `` competitive '' handbook can provide . both are great .
this is my favorite movie . i like it all : screenplay , director , actors , etc . believe it brilliant
`` berlin '' , which was reed 's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) <NUM> album `` transformer '' , showcases a radical change in reed 's direction . whereas `` transformer '' was a mostty light and musically catchy album , `` berlin '' is a more complex and darker album ; both musically and lyrically . no tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on `` transformer '' , and the album contains no new hit-singles . the album works much better to be listened to as a whole , and only few tracks are suited for `` best of '' compilations . songs like `` caroline says '' and `` how do think it feels '' would be the most obvious selections to put out . this does n't mean that this is not good album ; on the contrary ; it may be his artistically most successful . musically it 's very varied in style and instrumentation . the `` berlin '' theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks ; especially `` lady day '' ( kurt weil ) . the songs are generally longer than on reed 's two previous albums , but you are never bored when listening to the album ; and once you have gotten to know the songs , you 'll notice that it is really a very melodic album , with no unimportant tracks . this is reed 's dark masterpiece
i would have to say it has everything , and is highly readable , which i think is an important recommendation to give potential readers of classic fiction . it is beautiful , simple , filled with humor and compassion . i particularly liked the way hugo pokes fun at the absurdities of anti-gypsy prejudice and other social bigotry . esmerelda 's suitor , however , is a terrible selfish jerk in this story , which is far funnier and more believable than the selfless sap he plays in the disney movie . altogether an unforgettable read , and an unforgettable character in the hunchback , who hugo paints with considerable humanity
if you 're anything like <NUM> % of the folks in the theater when i saw this film , you 'll probably start rolling your eyes , exhaling loudly , and moaning about 1/3 in . with that said , i thought it was fantastic . the fountain is flawed , for sure , in its pacing and its grandiosity , but what you get in return for patience is a very thoughtful and gorgeous experience . it 's clear that aronofsky really loved this project . other reviewers hsve said that this is n't so much a movie , but a work of art , and while i 'm a bit hesitant , i agree . do n't expect requiem for a dream . do n't expect a `` thrill ride '' . just watch it when you have the time/headspace to devote to it , and you 'll feel something , one way or the other . * the soundtrack , by the way , is nearly as beautiful as the film itself . definitely to be checked out
season <NUM> of this fantastic 80s detective series brings a new feel to the show . most notably , murphy and bernice fox are gone , and replaced by doris roberts ( now known more for playing marie barone on everybody loves raymond ) . it is likely that the writers determined that murphy was leading the show into `` love triangle '' territory in season <NUM> , and that fans just wanted remington and laura to be together without the complications . at the same time , bernice fox seemed to serve no purpose beyond appearing at the desk whenever the lobby was shown . so , they combined the two into ms. krebs , a character who could fill the role of secretary , while also occasionally appearing outside the office without posing a threat to the steele/holt relationship . while murph and fox are missed , doris roberts shines in the role , especially in the later seasons . unfortunately , the season begins with an hour-and-a-half episode that is almost a chore to sit through . in a seeming attempt to bring to mind the james bond feel of exotic locations , the composer even went so far as to score a theme for the action scenes that is so obviously a combination of the original bond theme and the melody of from russia with love . this season opener is the beginning of the `` exotic locale '' episodes , and increasingly over the next three seasons we would see the team travel to mexico , malta , britain , ireland . . . i never really cared for these episodes . i preferred them staying in la with the pretty night ligths and almost noirish atmosphere . at any rate , things pick up in the second episode as laura comes under personal attack so unrelenting , that it costs her a house ! a scene midway with laura staring blankly at the burning rubble as she musters the strength to carry on is an early performance high for the fantastic stephanie zimbalist . brosnan himself would shine a few episodes later when framed for a murder he did n't commit . this episode inroduces a recurring character who proves to be quite a foil to the pair . also introduced this season is the vintage auburn automobile , which would get an entire episode devoted to its own mystery before becoming a regular fixture on the show . all told , season <NUM> manages to grow the potential of the show beyond the `` mystery of the week '' that was season <NUM> . we really get to explore with more depth what makes both characters work - and with murphy out of the way , steele is free to become a little more macho and self-assured . but do not worry - there is still enough of the slightly-bumbling cary grant style that makes him so lovable ! my only real complaint with this season is that the writers never really seemed to be clear on where the `` relationship '' between the two was headed . they might have a major romance scene in one episode , then have no romance for a stretch of four or five - and then suddenly be close again . after awhile , the relationship becomes frankly boring , and the stories take center stage . however , it is still great tv , and another well-produced dvd set for the money . as before , the handful of 10-minute documentary shorts are spread throughout the four discs , and are nostalgiac and quick paced so as to be enjoyed without being overlong . all told , this is a worthy set - and no , i 'm not going to say it 's a steele at any price ! that 's getting old now !
i had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was , so i was thrilled to find it here at amazon ! granted , it 's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover , but this one fits in my car stereo , makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago ! thanks
i caught this band the other night on the pbs show `` austin city limits '' . every song they did was unique , and very well done . the song that really stuck in my head was the title track from this album , more adventurous . i 'm really a fan of jazz , but i can certainly recognize talent , and these guys are headed for the top
this disk contains two westerns , both staring jimmy stewart and henry fonda . the pair works well together in very different roles . the first is a comedy and the second is a drama . in the first they are buddies , in the second they are enemies . in both , they are splendid . individual reviews appear below : the cheyenne social club this one 's a hoot jimmy stewart and henry fonda play a couple of cowboys working on the range . when stewart gets a letter he is surprised to learn that his bother has died and left him his business . it is a placed called the cheyenne social club . so it is that stewart and his sidekick , fonda , set out for wyoming with the expectation of becoming respectable business men . upon arrival , stewart learns that he is the most popular and respected man in town . he also learns that his social club is a brothel . this strikes him as not being `` in his line of work '' and he determines to close the place down . that takes him from being the most respected to the most reviled man in town . he has some hard decisions to make and even more trouble appears when he learns that there are contractual agreements between his shop and the railroad . things get more complicated still when he learns that there are some ruffians roughing up some of his girls . stewart is just a nice guy trying to do the `` right thing '' . eventually , he does ... much to his own surprise . firecreek sometimes the little guys win this is another pairing of jimmy stewart and henry fonda in a western . stewart plays a farmer , respected by his peers and given the honorary title of sheriff in his town . the tile also comes with a home made tin badge and <NUM> dollars . it is a sign of esteem and nothing more . fonda plays the leader of a group of gunmen with vague notions about law and order . when passing through town , they decide to stop there a little while and rest . nobody really minds that but they do object to being treated like vermin by the gunmen who get a bit wild when they drink . fonda does not really approve of what they do but is reluctant to come down on them too hard for fear of alienating them . that means that it is up to the sheriff to keep order . keeping order is a hard job . he is not trained and he is certainly no gunfighter . he is just a farmer . the townspeople encourage him just to ignore things in the hope that the bad guys will eventually go away . all are frightened . when a friend is lynched , though , stewart decides that enough is enough and takes on the whole gang . this is one of those films in which the little guy manages to stand up to the bully , survive and even win . it comes at a cost , though .
i found this book well written and deals with key issues that are importnat in todays world such as immigration , nationalism , democrasy and terrorism . the book is divided into <NUM> parts . each of these parts include issues that examine nationalism , immigration , governments and racism . also anti-immigrant sentiments , the `` war on terror , '' muslim and jewish semitism as well as importnat issues of power . i found a section particularly interesting dedicated to helping people understand where trouble and violence may erupt in volatile areas . due to rifaats personal experience with turbulence and war , he became alerted to several factors which lead him to predict where aggressive nationalism may occur . he formalized a model to help foresee where trouble and violence might erupt . he states this modle proved useful over the years , as he prevented a multinational corporation from putting its head office in beirut a few years before civil war broke out . he read the signes indication the possibility of violence on a large scale . the four factors which rifaat formulated to reliably indicate a probable outbreak of violence is the instinctive nature of group formation coupled with fanning the falmes of nationalism , the lack of human inhibition for killing and the power leaders possess . the book offers an interesting , exciting and sometimes humorous view into world politics , racial profiling , terrorism and above all , lessons in human nature . if you want a witty insight into these issues get this book .
imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months . what would you do ? what would you decide mattered to you ? what would you think you had accomplished ? what would you consider left unaccomplished ? what would you want your legacy to be ? those are the questions facing the centeral character in akira kurosawa 's ikiru ( meaning `` to live '' ) . the brilliant actor takashi shimura plays the role of kanji watanabe , a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little . one day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die . this revelation makes him start reviewing his life , and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile . he tries to `` live it up '' with newfound friends and loose women , but this does not fulfill him . he can not bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate ; caught up in their own petty problems , they seem to have little time for the old man . eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit , another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful . but even she can not help this poor man who needs love , fulfillment , a sense of purpose . and so watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days , a reason centered around doing genuine good , regardless of the chance of reward . after he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who , while previously fighting him every step of the way , now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory , paying him much lip service while denying him true honor . normally i do n't give so detailed a plot description , but i 've done so here for two reasons : <NUM> ) few people , particularly in america , have seen or even heard of this movie , and <NUM> ) i want to point out how universal the themes are , how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast . while watching ikiru i kept thinking a good modern title might be , `` the more things change the more they stay the same . '' like so many kurosawa films , this movie , though black and white and old , feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content . while much has been made of kurosawa 's concern with the japanese conflict between collective and individual , the issues in ikiru resonates with any culture , not just japan 's . these bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar . this is a very deep film , filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle . it asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life . at the same time , it never feels pretentious or preachy . the story is complex , not in terms of plot twists , but in terms of its `` inner life . '' yet with a running time of two hours and <NUM> minutes , ikiru moves very quickly , feeling faster than a typical 90-minute hollywood film . this is probably because there is lots of ground to cover , and also because of the effortless acting . takashi shimura 's performance as watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema . though shimura is not widely known in the west , he was one of japan 's major actors of the 1950s and 60s , and kurosawa worked with him often . see him in kurosawa 's seven samuri , made just two years after this film , for a completely different performance , one of swagger and bravado . other cast members are also outstanding , especially miki odagiri as a young female coworker . she too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher , but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves . on a sort of date with watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave , and that his is `` the mummy . '' rather than be offended , he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed . it 's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this . yet the film , or the third act of it , also reminded me of a very different motion picture -- citizen kane , believe it or not . while stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common , both deal with a man , recently dead , who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially . they try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture , while we , as the omniscent audience , do . they misunderstand his actions , and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite . ( often with kane the reverse is true . ) the only difference is while watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character , kane is not . also , kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces . ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century , yutaka katayama ( or `` mr. k , '' as he was called by many ) . katayama was the head of nissan motor 's west coast division in north america in the 1960s and 70s . he was brought to the task when nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence , especially in north america , which was then ruled by big , powerful ford and gm cars . though katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death , he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in america , which he did through steady , unflagging determination . but he also went against the grain of japanese business protocol , and encountered the wrath of his superiors in tokyo . ironically , the more successful he became , the more he was resented . ( his far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the japanese bosses . ) after establishing nissan as a major player in america , katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work . he died in obscurity , but today mr. k is a revered figure at nissan , and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago . executives now dislocate their jaws praising him . it all sounds too familiar . the second dvd has two features , a <NUM> minute documentary from kurosawa 's own production company about his working methods , wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product ; and a 40-minute feature about making ikiru , with cast and crew interviews . both docs are excellent and you will watch ikiru with more intelligence after you see them . there 's also the film 's trailer and a commentary track which i confess i have n't had time to listen to . it 's by stephen prince , author of the warrior 's camera : the cinema of akira kurosawa . criterion once again is the standard to which all dvd makers should be aspiring . the print , while scratched and battered a bit with age , is as good as we 're likely to see . it 's unfortunate that for many years kurosawa 's work was not better taken care of . like nissan 's mr. k , he was without honor in his own country , because he was considered `` too western '' in his outlook . like mr. k , his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland . fortunately , the work of this `` mr. k '' is finally being preserved . ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you 've never seen a japanese movie before , even if you 've never heard of akira kurosawa , even if you `` hate '' foreign or black and white films , even if you think you have no interest in the subject . because that subject is in fact very modern and universal , and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story . ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term `` timeless classic .
consumers love irony ! i can sum up this film in one sentence : djing , drugs , hummus and sex ... silence ... newfound appreciation for life . what makes this film great is not the fact that frankie wilde does drugs , rather , its how he does drugs ( see it and you 'll understand what i mean ) . same thing with his djing . the fact that he djs is well-and-good , but you have to see how he djs ( pre- and post-deaf ) . frankie is a special character and paul kaye nails this role ( as he says in the dvd extras , `` god , i 've waited a long time for this job. '' ) . speaking of dvd extras ... watch them . frankie the spokesmodel for oman whiskey , frankie on a cooking show , frankie on an interview with a news anchor , frankie 's rabbi ( played by paul kaye ) , among other gimmicks ... classic . in regards to credentials ... winner gen art film festival , winner u.s . comedy arts festival , winner toronto film festival . and the soundtrack ... exceptional club music . particularly , reflekt 's `` need to feel loved '' ( seb fontaine & jay p remix ) . i guarantee you will re-watch this film over and over again . maybe you 'll even take a step back and have a look at your own life ? note : this film is a work of fiction . it is a `` mock '' umentary . do n't be fooled . the fact that the directors and actors deliver such a compelling final product , where consumers actually believe it is real , is testament alone that this film is a keeper . please feel free to disagree with my opinion ; let us compare opinions , invite a few more points of view , and debate , like the humans we are .
maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies , not just describing how people talk about themselves , but how they talk about each other . in the end , i think this is the most interesting part of the book , what it tells us about the gossip of shanghai people . as a person who grew up in shanghai and left eight years ago , i am drawn to all stories of shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home . so i bought this book in the university book store . what i found is an unusual type of story , written by a foreign , well american , man about sex in shanghai . some things he writes are so familiar to me i laughed out loud . others are not what i remember of shanghai . i like best the stories these people tell about their friends . i remembered some of the stories in my street , and it made me laugh
as another reviewer said . this may be the easiest cd to wear out in <NUM> days
if you are one of those people who still doubts the movie is far from being an artistic ecpression ; come to cocteu 's world and please convince by yourself about the veracity of this affirmation . cocteau adapted the classic orpheus 's myth to the present times , but keeping the essential basis of the myth and its veil 's mystery . the poetry literally loads the picture all along the way . blood of a poet constitutes undoubtedly , the first reference step you must ascend to higher peaks . the surrealist airs are present with all the frenzy of the first opus ; rapture images and seductive illusion , irreverence and disobey ; a real captive journey through the fourth wall where the dreams and love live . in orpheus , we will assist to the dramatic premise : orpheus is obsessed with his wife 's death . heuterbise and cegeste will his fellows friends and his lamentations and complaints are at last satisfied when he will get the opportunity to get through the frontier between the life and death . she will visit to his beloved wife in clear reference to dante and beatrice but he will sign a pact with the underworld 's jury : he will return with his beloved wife with jus one condition : he wo n't be able to watch her under any pretext or reason . to look behind : this is the most important reflection that feeds not only this fabulous myth but even an apparent far distant work as faust : to look behind means to be frozen in the time 's shadows ; and faust through the decision of becoming to the dead youth will establish his own agreement with satan . but you have more : when lot 's wife in the christian mythology looks behind becomes in salt 's statue . the memories constitue a real matrix : it 's seductive , the enviroment temperature is so warm and seductive that you can be engaged through your entire life . narcisus comes to our mind when the human being , once has reached the experience 's stage , pretendes , mistakenly , to get back to the ancestral origin : the naive innocence . if you decide to get back , you are committed to pay a prize , that 's why orpheus will be murdered in the hades . finally in orpheus ' testament we assist to the last farewell of the poet . inquired by the great jury cocteau answers : `` a film is the petrified image of the mind which resurrects the dead acts '' . he will be punished to live in his final days till the time will come for him to fade . the final encounter with oediphus literally will invade you of perplexity and cosmic anguish ; to be so close and unable to meet one each other . consider this film not only one of the twenty giants films one any age ever made but one of the ten top french films and perhaps one the three most admired and perfect film in the whole cinema 's story . the other two to my mind would be : carne 's children of the paradise and robert bresson 's a man escapes . when a rose vanishes , the poetry will wait for it and the cycle will start over and over !
the production looked like a `` wet fresco '' on the wall of an old basilica that has come to life . the choreography is in close harmony with the musical score . i enjoyed the meadow dancers , aqua dancers , grafitti wallsters and graffiti tree . but , most of all , i enjoyed the `` foot-prep '' of peter , the grandfather , the cat , the bird , the duck and the wolf .
william o'neal covers all major stock trading areas in this book : how to find a broker , his can slim method for making money on stocks , when to sell , how to diversify , when to buy options , he shows charts of the biggest stock winners from <NUM> to <NUM> , how to read stock price history charts and much more . it is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners . i would advise reading `` the neatest little guide to the stock market '' before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks . here is a summary of his can slim method to making money in the stock market , this is how to buy stocks : c= current quarterly earnings : are they enough ? a=annual earnings increases : do they have meaningful growth ? n=new products , new management , new highs : is it time to buy ? s=supply and demand : small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase . l=leader or laggard : only buy leaders . i=institutional sponsorship : a little will drive up price . m=market direction=how to determine it and follow . the final chapter is <NUM> common mistakes most investors make , this is excellent advice for what not to do . this book 's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or p/e ratios . he justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued , when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors . great book i highly recommend
the colors and shapes book is a very useful tool for learning the basics of spanish . if you want something that is easy to read and understand , this is your book . from reading this book , i think anyone would be able to learn the basic colors and shapes in both english and spanish . my favorite part was the last page which was a picture of a colorful room full of shapes . this was a good exercise to wrap up the book and apply the words that i learned . a child would be able to use this book , and others like it in the series , to learn and then apply knowledge in every day life when seeing colors and shapes of any kind . this book does n't just stick to simple shapes such as circle and square , but also includes words for diamond , sphere , and cone .
so lush and rich and vivid ; and yet sullied by racism . what a tragedy that icredibly beautiful writing like this is now compromised by sensitivities that wolfe did not perceive . a flaw that should be forgiven and yet is so difficult to do when confronted with the ugly racism of some passages . however , if one can forgive , wolfe is without doubt the greatest american writer
heard the cassette version of jackie , ethel , joan : women of camelot by . j. randy taraborrelli and enjoyed it -- in a guilty pleasure sort of way . it is a tell-it-all about the three kenney wives and listening to it helped me relive some days of my younger days when john , robert and ted kenney were alive and running for various political offices . for some reason , i never followed too closely the dirt behind their respective careers . . . yet this book more than made up for anything i may have missed . if everything in it is to be believed , i now know that joe kennedy offered jackie $ <NUM> million not to divorce jfk and jackie allegedly replied , `` the price goes to $ <NUM> million if jack brings home any venereal diseases . '' . . . also , that bobby had an affair with actress lee remick who actually called ethel to tell her that they were sleeping together -- only to be told by ethel that he was home in bed ( when he was actually with remick ) . . . and that ted once showed up for drunk with a prostitute for dinner with the king and queen of belgium , whose priceless antique coach ted 's date ruined by wetting it . overall , the book left me feeling sorry for the kennedy women . . . although they appeared so glorious from afar , how they were forced to live their lives because of the constant spotlight made life anything but easy for them .
baseball fans with an affection for the sports history will relish the renewed examination of babe ruth 's life and career , which packs in almost a hundred photos to supplement anecdotes from those who knew him . readers will find here an affectionate examination of babe ruth 's life and times along with a fine visual coverage of baseball history
you will want to buy this movie once you have see madea 's family reunion
all the classics are on this dvd . you would n't think dr. seuss would be bad for young children since the books are great for first time readers but my son starting pointing aggressively and saying `` no '' and `` out '' just like the fish does to the cat in the hat when we would ask him not to do something . there is always at least one character that is angry .
das boot held my intrest from begining to end . i felt i was on the submarine . i used the english subtitles , but i found myself turning up the volume to hear the german dialogue . adventure , action , and suspense truly a great movie . six stars to the director .
a revealing examination of the iraq war , with substantial support from intelligence and military sources . it challenges the heretofore accepted accounts that bad intelligence led to the u.s.-led invasion to pre-empt iraqi wmd deployment . chapters are - unfortunately - not provided .
i thought `` delirium tremolos '' was the ultimate display of ray wylie hubbard 's style & talent , then i listened to `` snake farm '' . wow ! i did n't think rwh 's essence could be distilled down any further after `` dt '' , but with `` snake farm '' i was hooked from the first riff & did n't come up for air until the cd changer kicked in at the end . this stuff is <NUM> proof hubbard . honey , it 's all good , down to the last drop
this <NUM> follow up to the wailers debut ` catch a fire ' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the jamaican underground scene for years . ` get up , stand up ' and ` i shot the sheriff ' are two of the most hitting cuts the wailers ever recorded , but the rest of the material does n't have the same mass appeal of their other albums . this is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience . it 's a cool set but ` burnin ' is n't an album i can bump too much
what stands out most in mike nichols ' production of angels in america in the performaces . al pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way . no one else really talked about belize played by jeffrey wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill ( not to mention his amusing depiction of mr . lies ) . watch his description of heaven to al pacino 's character very carefully , the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite . i think justin kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with meryl streep are great to watch . the production only falls short with mary louise parker 's character . she reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying . i wanted a little more passion and bite from her . another disappointment is the sort of forced ending . each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play . but the fully realized characters are what you should come to see
after reading king leopold 's ghost , i was looking for a good synopsis of what happened in the post-colonial era . after a few weeks of searching , i settled on in the footsteps of mr. kurtz . both were fascinating books that give great insight on the problems with the congo . both are written in a style that is highly readable , entrhalling and at the same time informative .
scarface has definately captured the love of the street in this here album . he straight up kept it real with all the homeboys in todays ' rap biz . with tracks like `` do what the .... you want to do '' all the homies in the street like me be flockin ' to the record store for the fact that be the motto . there is a lot of bad mouthin ' goin ' on in these reviews , but them folks need to check nuts and realize what has been done here . scarface dedicates this to homies in the street , that 's real . so much respect goes to the big homie scarface for givin ' it up to the street
i liked the deleted scenes ... too bad they took them out from the general audiences . those scenes made for a more powerful human story ... too powerful for civilians , i guess . excellent movie
salem 's lot has become a yearly staple for me . when the days begin to grow short , and the air gets a little thick and crisp , i like to pull this book out , and go for a lie in the hammock . it has been a fall favorite , since my freshman year of college . though not entirely wholesome , this book is one of the most puritan of stephen king 's prolific library . there are really no graphic sexual scenes , and the language is tame , in comparison to . . . say , the stand . but you do n't care about that . you want to know why i thought it was a heck of a good read . king is fascinated by small towns . i can say that with a good deal of authority , because two-thirds of what he writes about takes place in small , maine towns . it 's not the four-way intersections , and the cowpoke attitude that seems to capture his interest , but the dynamics of the small town , itself . there is a certain attitude , in a small town ; kind of like high school cliques , but on a grander scheme . a small town has its own atmosphere ; its own incestuous existence . stephen king enjoys watching as relationships frazzle , and small towns are demolished , with the ghoulish glee of a small child knocking over sandcastles . 'salem 's lot mixes stark dread with a rockwellian nostalgia that oozes out of the pages . the result is a horrifically delicious milkshake that covers some traditional vampire ground , but also manages to stay fresh and poignant . if the cemetery scene ( in which a father grieves for his dead son ) does n't give you goosebumps , you are truly a jaded individual .
simply put , i bought this , brought it home , and spent the wee hours of the night smiling on the couch as the one and only buckethead filled my living room with his unique brand of guitar-shred-funk-fusion-dementia . this dvd is a trip , from the wacked out menus to the oodles of content that cover his whole career so far ... videos ( praxis ! ) , discography ( you think you have it all , but i assure you , you do n't ) , and a bonus dvd with <NUM> live shows ( it does n't hurt that i can see myself in the boston one , laughing like a goon as he hands out toys ) . there 's just tons of bucketgoodies hiding in here . this dude is just the whole package-eddie van halen and eddie hazel all in one , mixed with leatherface and the shape . so rad . this dvd definitely had a lot of time and creativity put into it , so to anyone who does n't enjoy this for the perfect representation of the bucketman that it is , you simply be missin ' the point . might i suggest you stick to your dream theater/satriani/g3 dvd 's , you 5.1 surround sound obsessed prog-metal nerds ... you do n't like chickens , get out the coop
i just got this book and i have already become obsessed with dreams of building my own rolling home this summer . the photographs are all very beautiful , and the book is also full of great drawings and diagrams . not much text , but what 's there is very well written . this book has inspired me to live my life in a whole new , fun way . this is definately worth buying
this is a wonderful dvd of jess . it shows an * inside view * of jess ' life on tour plus includes several interviews with her as well as songs . i learned alot of info from this cd about jessica that i did not know previously ..... and i thought i knew * it all * ? ? ! ! i 'd recommend this dvd to anyone who is a serious jessica simpson fan and wants to learn more about her . it also gives you an inside * peek * into the hollywood * biz * and the fast-pace lifestyle jess lives ! !
an excellent cast , great adventure for western lovers . each of the stars shine in their characters from a black camanche sold to a determined mountain man to get his furs back from indians later massacred and taken by a ruthless bounty hunter . and yes , there is romance
the story starts with an introduction to a somewhat cantankerous , yet highly amusing character , gen . he is stuck in jail , having been caught thieving . he bragged about the theft , which is what got him caught . he is taken from prison and told that the king wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth . gen 's only other option is death . so onward the journey goes . he travels with the magus and his two apprentices , ambiades and sophos , plus the admirable soldier , pol . gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft . this viewpoint lends a somewhat snide , yet funny and endearing perspective of the story . i enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout . plus , on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their gods through campfire stories , which i found a wonderful addition to the story . they added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did . i thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale . yes , a worthy read indeed
i have taught a couple of summer schools with prek and kindergarten students and we had soooo much fun with many of these songs . the absolute favorite is the first song `` hello to all the children of the world '' , which teaches children to say hello in different languages . we did half sign language , half movement which made it not only fun for the kids , but also for the parents when we sang this song to them . the other favorite songs : `` brown girl in the ring '' and `` going over the sea '' . if you are a teacher or even a parent , your kids will love this cd and will learn a little culture in the process
dr. schwalbe 's commonsense approach to teaching you precisely what you need to know in order to pass comptia 's it project + exam should be commended . she did a great job covering all exam topics as well as providing relevant practice test questions . i had no problems at all passing this test and i owe it all to dr. schwalbe 's , & quot ; it project + courseprep examguide. & quot ; i highly recommend this book if you 're serious about passing comptia 's it project + exam
as a seer , i have received information for almost <NUM> years that we are each an individualization of god and god is actually the sum total of all . i am happy to read in gregg 's work that he has discovered scientific evidence of this fact which i hope will motivate readers to turn within to find their own divinity as opposed to seeking it from an outside source
this was an interesting and fun book . the good guys are a little bad and the bad guys are a little good , although there are some really bad ones . reminiscient of the nightside books by simon green , but still totally different . inspector chen is a good guy who does the best he can , and still ca n't keep from getting involved with demons . holds your interest from the first , and keeps you turning those pages . i liked the short chapters , and the overall format of the book . the artwork on the cover is gorgeous . i 'm definitely reading the rest of this series . this was the first liz williams book i have read , and i plan to look into her others
the care bears movie is a wonderful movie for the whole family . with great voice acting , including mickey rooney as the narrator , mr. cherrywood , this is a special treat that will warm your heart and make you laugh . the opening song was written and sung by the great carole king . it sets the stage for what the care bears are all about . in their clouds and rainbow filled care-a-lot , they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend . little stars flit about and help them . the story is about a magician 's assistant named nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit . nicholas has always felt lonely . the evil spirit takes advantage of that , and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring . this is almost too much for the gentle care bears . luckily , they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the forest of feelings with other cute critters . there are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful . as far as this being a feature-length commercial , the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more care bear cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge . but that is minor . my husband even loved this movie and was humming along at the closing song !
i feel this is a pretty good workout . the cardio is good , but not too much . she does n't mention much about the fact that we 're pregnant , but i feel it 's a safe workout and a good one . i 'd recommend it to anyone that exercises on a fairly regular basis .
what a girl wants is a soundtrack with some cheesy music and some poppy princess music , which inbalances it . the music in the movie well fits the scenes that they 're in , but it 's just very `` cheesy '' and `` princess poppy '' . some of the music is very upbeat and some of the music changes your attitude as you listen to that song , giving you a mood the song has . but overall , the soundtrack is pretty worth the listen to . <NUM> . good life - leslie millis 5/5 <NUM> . out of place - gavin thorpe 3/5 <NUM> . crazy - meredith brooks 3/5 <NUM> . london calling - the clash 3/5 5. who invited you - the donnas 2/5 <NUM> . long time coming - oliver james 1/5 <NUM> . kiss kiss - holly valance 5/5 <NUM> . what 's your flava ? - craig david 5/5 <NUM> . i wan na be bad - willa ford 3/5 <NUM> . half-life - duncan sheik 1/5 <NUM> . somebody stop me - erica rivera 5/5 <NUM> . rock and roll , hoochie koo - rick derringer 0/5 <NUM> . greatest story ever told - oliver james 0/5 <NUM> . what 's good for me - lucy woodward 3/5 <NUM> . ride of your life - john gregory 4/5 hope you enjoy jordan overall grade * b-
one of the best casts in a long long time , great british comedians such as steve coogan , peter kay , rob brydon , simon pegg . a very funny movies , based on a true story about tony wilson the founder of the hacienda ( a famous nightclub in the <NUM> 's in manchester uk ) , this movie is a must see for people into punk and dance
i 've followed harry for years and have always enjoyed his albums because each one has a slightly different sound from the rest . this latest cd is light , has gentle compositions , and is also swingin ' fun . it puts me in the mood for dancing under the stars or curling up by the fire . i think it 's about time harry did a cd like this
a complete wodehouse fanatic , i would have trouble giving less that five stars to anything i have read so far . uncle fred is a particularly good one to add to the guest room bookshelf -- -- incredibly funny and nice light reading for a few days away from home
excellent , based in scientific research . it is not a `` sexual book '' but a well written book about hormones , thinking , acting and why men and women are different
this book has fascinating events happening all the time . i could n't even blink one second away from it . even though this book was used for a project , it was far more for me than homework ... this book really teaches true lessons that all of us , young the elders need to learn . especially from johnny raven 's point of view . the story plot was fascinating ... how many times did i use that word .. ? well it is truly is ...
i remembered this collection of world tales from my own youth and was pleased that it was just as vibrant and fun as i remembered . although the tales center around female protagonists , children and adults of any gender can enjoy the action , wit , and surprising tales featured here .
flawless and beautifully rieveting `` the joy luck club '' has to be the best movie i have ever seen , and probably will be the only one of it 's kind . the story is beautiful and timeless and i encourage everyone to see it . it makes you think of the relationships of your family and how , even though this is a movie , it can impact you beyond belief . it will rock you to the core of your being and i am living proof
i had not read much from this author except her <NUM> book series with beverly lahaye , but when our library had this one in large print , i just picked it up `` accidentally '' and decided to read it . i had not gotten into many pages when i was grabbed by the plot . i did not even know there was a second chance series and i rather wondered how a secular book could be re-written sucessfully as a christian fiction book , but this one was wonderful . when wes first met laney , he suspected her of being a stalker and/or kidnapper of children , and he had her arrested . his fears seemed rational until he heard her story . the child of wes and his deceased wife patrice , was adopted right after birth , and laney , the birth mother had finally found them through illegal means . the story then unfolds of two people who have absolutely nothing in common except their love for one little girl , amy . through it all the ghost of wes ' dead wife patrice hangs heavily over both their heads as well as amy 's . i felt terri blackstock drew upon some incredible experience as an author to format and carry through with this suspenseful , love-hate story and the twists and turns which led to a very , very strange and almost unbelievable bond between wes and laney . i wish to thank the author for re-writing this book and for using her talent for her new `` boss '' , god . i am now searching for other second chances books by this author .
this is not a typical read for me , but i enjoyed it . i read the first <NUM> pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time , but when i hit chapter <NUM> , i read the rest of the book in one sitting . loved max , frannie , kit & all the others . looking forward to reading `` the lake house ''
just a wonderful vehicle for peter sellers . it not only illustrates his comedic abilities , but also the strength of his straight acting . there is a wonderful cameo from shirley maclaine , and the supporting cast are exactly that . this is a heart-warming , yet on deeper consideration quite sad film - 'what if ...... ? ' , and i rate it highly
this book takes place in the 1780s and is about a boy named nat bowditch . nat is great at figures and he has great perseverance . nat has just been taken out of school to help his dad make barrels for ships . but he was n't good at it at all . so his dad got him indentured for <NUM> years at ropes and hodges . afterwards he went on a ship and found out a new way to work lunars . after his first ship ride he went on several others and found over 2,000 mistakes in a book written by scientist . but do n't get to atached to the characters
what more is there to say about danny elfman 's batman score ? it 's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time . thousands of people have written their opinions of it . what more can i say ? i can say how it affected me personally . it was the first movie score i ever bought , and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said `` listen to this music in the opening credits riley '' . since then , my score collection has expanded <NUM> times , and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it . what can i say , really ? i ca n't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes . i can say that this music is incredible and still in my top <NUM> of all time . it 's elfman 's best work . it 's heroic , it 's dark , it 's thematic ( i dare you not to whistle the batman theme when this cd is over ) , it 's operatic , it 's over-the-top , it 's action packed , it 's brilliant from start to finish . there is n't any wasted space on this album . elfman has a job to do , and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success . he practically created this idea of a `` dark superhero theme '' , and while the movie was a slight dissappointment , this cd continues to thrill people of any generation . what can i say ? this score is a masterpiece . end of discussion . cheers k
a sailboat arrives in new york harbor . it seems abandoned but a coast guard member is killed by a man on board . the man is shot and falls into the harbor . the boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him . she and a reporter hire a boat to find her father . their destination is an island said to be cursed . the boat they hire is run by a young couple . along the way the couple do some diving ( she is topless ) . she is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it . she is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks . the continue to the island which is just a short distance away . once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living . legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation . unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known . but soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead . in the end , only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization . they keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy . this is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings . that aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly . there is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore , although somewhat tame by today 's standards . the acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent . i enjoyed the ending which i gather was supposed to be a shocker but which i predicted from the beginning . my guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead , or so the producers hoped . if you like zombie films you will have to check this one out
this cd is a must have if you are a hot boys ( old school cash money ) fan
this is by far the best concert video i own . the stones were on top of their game at this st. louis concert , soulful , bluesy , and rocking . the cameras stay on the band the whole time , unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience . the sound is cd quality , the picture and color is vivid , the editing is tight . the highlight for me is keith richards ' `` i wan na hold you '' and some incredible versions of many classics . the songs from the bridges to babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire . the fact of the matter is the stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts . i highly recommend this dvd . it is superior to the four flicks , and a lot less expensive . five stars
this was my introduction to t.o.p . and it gradually became a collection of undiscovered classics for me personally . this brand of big & intricate funk really grows on you . if you have n't bought a copy yet , go ahead and `` knock yourself out .
when this cd came out , i ordered it immediately , without watching the movie first . since i live in holland and the movie was n't out here yet . i 'm a huge fan of john powell 's scores and i 'm glad ( again ) i bought this score . the score sounds a little bit like 'the italian job ' with a spanish flavour to it , because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars . although the tracks are new and refreshing , i found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd . like : the 'house fight ' part with al the percussion instruments . it 's on the cd ( 'kiss and make up - i believe ) , and it 's a brilliant piece of percussion , but it 's not the same as in the movie ( that sounded better to me ) . second : the cd is a little on the short side . the total play length of the soundtrack is only <NUM> minutes . a lot of tracks ( <NUM> ) all relatively short , but ... different . so you 'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody 's . something to get used to after listening to the more monotone bourne identity soundtrack . nevertheless a brilliant soundtrack , a must have for the john powell score fans ! ( sorry for the dutch-english ) grtz , from holland
most of the reviews above are political diatribes against keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes . the key to understanding keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle , an economy can become over-productive ( or under-consumptive ) and thus , a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand . thus , full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria . if an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium , something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment . this something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions , it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment . keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't . expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment . borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick , direct way to restore full employment while at the same time , redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place . although difficult to read , this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics . far from being destructive , it alone has been responsible for nearly <NUM> years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the <NUM> 's . i recommend you read this book
we rented this movie and watched it a dozen times with my kids ( ages 4-6 ) . we kept it well past the return date and now we will end up buying it on amazon . the kids are talented little actors and this was a nice movie for the family . i ca n't count the number of times that little chimp made my <NUM> year old twins giggle and cheer . great job
its doubtful that there have been two jazz musicians more suited to record together than ben webster and sweets edison . alumni of the ellington and basie bands respectively , these two mainstream swing players have marvelous chemistry on this session . the charts are perfect vehicles for webster 's warm tone and silky phrasing as well as edison 's blues-ridden melodic style that matured in the mid and late <NUM> 's . most of the tunes swing hard anchored by a solid basie-esque rhythm section . you 'll wear this one out
i do n't know how else to describe this book .... it 's just sheer beauty . just by picking up this book and reading a few pages , you will feel your heart open and your body relax . it 's a positive book that makes you feel great about being alive and reinforces loving behavior . no matter how mindful and compassionate you are , teachings on love will inspire you to create beautiful relationships and to love everyone . do yourself a great favor and buy this wonderful book
i am one of the few who believe that `` is n't anything '' is leagues better than `` loveless '' . this is one of my favorite albums ; therefore , it 's one of the few albums i 've actually purchased . `` is n't anything '' is n't really one of the most uplifting albums of all time , but it is undoubtedly original and i might even add , influencial . the lyrics are beautiful and heartfelt , the vocals are what really makes the album so dreamy . kevin shield 's voice is like a blur , and i do n't even know what a blur sounds like . `` no more sorry '' is what really made the album for me , personally , it just flows very well . this is n't really an album you 'd want to just listen to the drumsticks hit the drums and the pics hit the guitar , no , you should concentrate very hard on the lyrics . maybe , you 'll even pick up the messege 'my bloody valentine ' are trying to send across . of course though , that 's a different messege for everyone
i ca n't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book , there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that , but other than that i 'll have to read the other reviews . anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which god goes to in order to bring us to salvation , while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it 's beauty and glory in careful suspension . i believe this is the notion of his love that lewis is focused on . as a last resort method of god communicating with us , pain plays a - well - painful role , to which i 'm no stranger . still i 'll bet that when we get to heaven god will truthfully say , it hurt me far , far more than it hurt you . amen .
some folks might rent or buy this dvd for its well known names , but vin disel and ben afflec play very small roles it is giovanni ribsi that shines . he plays a young college drop out , who turns to an in-house , illegal gambling den to help him release his inner rage and built up anxieties towards his demanding father . ( spoilers ) but it is his discovery of a boiler room operation hawking non-existent stocks and bonds for non-existent companies that really steers this movie . fantastic interactions between the main character , and vin disel character . i appreciated the relationship beteen giovanni and the secretary character , but i felt it was under-developed and weak . could have been left out , or developed better . i saw this one in the theater , and now own on dvd , and would recommend it to any pre-mba student , or wall street wannabe . it is great training . mc white said : check it out !
i showed excerpts from this series to my ninth-grade science classes and got lots of positive feedback . my own kids liked it as well . lots of good `` probable case scenarios . '' will drive creationists crazy .
[ ... ] this five volume history of the victorian bourgeois follows a freudian schematic : the first volume dealt with love , the second with sex , and this volume with agression . this book was my favorite of the three i 've read so far . gay picks apart the victorian penchant for cloaked agression with admirable scholastic fortitude . his discussion of foucault 's theory of prisons is a high light for this entire five volume set . his critique of what he calls the `` social control '' theorists is that they fail to take into account the ability of the powerful to delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing , even when they are most assuredly not . why stop here ? only two more volumes to go ..
the best work by twain i 've read to date . this combination history , memoir , travelogue , and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining . i have also learned a great deal about twain , his time , and the history of steamboating and the mississippi . written later in his life , this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus . highly recommended
first off to avoid any conflict of interest claims i admit that i an a huge rod stewart fan . that being said , i just was n't interested in hearing him do the old american classics ( which i also love ) . i just did n't see how he could do them justice , that is , until i saw his dvd `` live from royal albert hall '' in which he did several of the songs from his first `` great american songbook '' . i was just blown away . these songs were now his . i went to the computer to order one of the cds but my wife talked me into getting all three and i am surely not sorry . i believe that there are very few cds available with no weak tracks ( there are some ) but here are three that just do n't have a weak track ( imho ) . he has made all of these great songs his . my all time favorite song is `` stardust '' by hoagy carmichael . i had never heard a version that i thought could top his , until now . if you love the old standards you should really give these <NUM> cds a listen . they 'll melt your heart ! ! !
this dvd is exactly what i was looking for - a plain `` old-fashioned '' aerobics class like the ones i attended back in the early 90s when i lost a lot of weight . i put some back on over the last few years and i knew that aerobics would be the thing to help me . all the classes at all the gyms around here are `` specialized '' - pilates , yoga , spinning , step , etc . - and not what i wanted . i have seen gilad 's shows on fit tv but i hated the commercials . so i went looking for a dvd and bought this one . i love it ... i was exhausted after it was done but i felt great . it is good for all levels . if you want a great , challenging and motivated aerobic workout , this is the dvd for you
i love every track of this cd . specially , 'missing you now ' , 'now that i found you ' and 'we 're not making love anymore ' . he sounds so perfect for me and i completely leave everything when anybody plays his song . great lyrics , perfect pitch and absolutely worthy cd to buy . its superb and deserves more than <NUM> stars
the musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when i saw it for the first time . my husband is no `` square '' and he enjoyed it all . seniors would love to see it again . the film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd
this album was released three years after the new pornographers awesome debut album . this album is similar , but has a more glossy feel than the previous album . the album is definately more polished . great synths and percussion throughout the album . electric version is an enjoyable and easy listen , chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock 's classic humility
the only reason why i gave this <NUM> out of <NUM> stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good , i wished there was an additional dvd on it that featured more classic matches from raw and nitro and more additional interviews . i was a little upset when they censored ravishing rick rude taking cheap shots at the wwe in the extra 's menu because he said more than they shown on the dvd . they also censored x-pac 's interview when he 's taking cheap shots at hogan and bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the wwe from wcw . i did think eric bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small ( but major ) details as well as vince holding back some info . overall , a nice wwe dvd to add to your collection . i just wish they added more matches and interviews . tna better watch themselves .
edited by sports illustrated magazine 's executive editor rob fleder , and with an introduction by popular football writer peter king , sports illustrated : great football writing compiles classic stories about football and football players from the pages of the venerable magazine , from the modern day to the <NUM> 's . from `` the nightmare of steroids '' to `` where have you gone , joe namath ? '' to `` all the way with o.j . '' - an article about simpson 's stellar football performance from long before his arrest and trial for murder - the articles cover the both the highlights and the low points of america 's long love affair with football . an excellent compendium or giftbook especially for thoughtful football fans , who enjoy pondering at length how the sport and its telling has gradually evolved with the decades
this is an excellent book for emergent level readers . i really liked the many quarter fold books which focus on both letter/sound recognition and high frequency words . i have used these activities in small group , as independent practice , as homework and in my literacy centers . also included are manuscript printing practice pages that work well as homework due to the detailed letter formation instructions on each page , class books , poetry , and letter cards . what a valuable resource - thank you
imagine a cartoon series that teaches your kids respect of elders , doing homework , saying your prayers at night , bite-sized science lessons , respecting other cultures and people while at the same time actually killing the bad guys instead of worrying about offending them . welcome to johnny quest - a journey into testosteroneland where men are men , boys are boys , bad guys get killed and women are nowhere to be found . this cartoon series is about as conservative as a cartoon can be . you will not see this box sitting on the movie shelf at your liberal friend 's house . for example , attacking crocodiles get repelled with gunfire , bad guys get shot ( dead ) , the key scientist has morals ( and prefers to be armed ) , and ex-military bodyguards protect the kiddies by using bullwhips to crack scorpions into pieces . also , dr. beton quest is prone to tell the boys to pray when science eventually fails to come to the rescue . jetpacks , hovercraft , jets , monsters , ray guns , scientific experiments , military action ( tanks vs robots ) , bad guys , soldiers and police ( being portrayed accurately in a positive light ! ) , prehistoric beasts , cavemen , natzi war criminals getting punished , etc . imagine the government only relying on real scientists who examine things through actual experiments and resulting data - not politicians pushing junk science like global warming , totally ignoring the millions of metric tons of greenhouse gasses and solid particulates volcanoes release and how it was warm enough for the vikings to grow crops in greenland 1,000 years ago . i would have paid hundreds of dollars for this dvd set . ps : you might be interested to know that the title of this product is mispeading , as there was never a second season of johnny quest , and thus , there will be no additional dvd sets of the original johnny quest - this is all there is . the original 1st-season <NUM> shows on this dvd set were actually stretched out over two seasons when it aired in 1964-65 . these <NUM> episodes are all that were ever made . the show was also hugely successful , but the production costs ( this kind cartoon-making was unprecidented at the time ) killed the series . race bannon for president
a great white noise kind of cd . just plain rain . well i must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me . whatever . my babies both nap really well to it . i recommend it to my mommy friends . it 's been a must at our house
this is a book unlike any other i have read . c.s . lewis calls macdonald his master but i could n't figure out why until i read this book . lilith is complex and stunning in its depth and imagery . i felt awakened after i read it .
i recently purchased this cd , what can i tell you it was like tasteing vintage champagne . i wanted more , the only negative was they left out my favorite dramatics song life of the party . otherwise a great cd just shopping not buying , if your not a fan this song will seal the deal . the intro alone is worth the price of the cd and ron bank 's falsetto ( unbelieve able ) . my recommendation buy it now
this is the most hilarious cd with a classical bent i have ever heard . allen sherman is gifted when it comes to imaginative uses of classical themes . anyone who has heard any of these famous melodies will laugh themselves silly when they hear what is done to them ! it 's a super pick-me-up when i 'm feeling blue . it 's a must-hear for all you classical music buffs !
whoever cares about iran or persia can get something from this book . it 's not much of a & quot ; journey & quot ; in the sense of a travelog , but the conversations and the few glimpsed scenes are worth the price . the author also provides lots of interesting , scholarly background , for example , on why iranians feel so unlucky , and why the cia is a sinkhole for good ideas . maybe the saddest moment in the book was the brief chat the author had with an older iranian , who practically begged to have us should bomb the mollahs . it 's sad , not because the mollahs are human beings and should live in peace , but because the thought of the us doing something to rescue people is so old-fashioned
mention the name orson welles and his most famous involvement - with the radio scare 'war of the worlds ' - immediately comes to mind ; but for a deeper understanding of welles ' life and career you need what ever happened to orson welles ? : a portrait of an independent career . his later projects were largely self-financed and erratically distributed , but film critic and biographer joseph mcbride has a personal familiarity with welles from previous projects worked on with him and here shows how the hollywood studio system forced welles out of the industry . its value thus is twofold : as a biography for welles fans , and as a history of film industry operations and politics . diane c. donovan california bookwatc
bob dylan and daniel lanois work better together , it seems to me , then many of the other people dylan has worked with . i certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff dylan did with tom petty , though i like that stuff too . i actually like this record as much as i like `` blood on the tracks '' and often have both of them in my cd changer at the same time ( which by the way i never set at random play with a bob dylan record , because dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety , the way dylan presented them ) . for me , this record fits nicely between `` tracks '' and `` time out of mind . '' sure he did some great stuff in between , but it 's these personal songs like `` what good am i ? '' that i like so much and , of course , the way bob dylan tells a story . there is nobody better
i 'm from florida and did n't know we had that much talent here . it 's been a long time since i bought a album that i did n't feel like i had spent <NUM> to <NUM> dollars to here <NUM> song that i liked . i rocked t-pain 's album from beginning to end . rappa ternt sanga proves the u do n't have to steal , kill , sell drugs , have sex , or be thuged out in ever song to interest people . . .
what a wonderful book . quite often , a book is real good until the ending , and then i 'm let down , but this has a really good ending too . this tale is really excellent : a verbal piece of art . i liked all the lineage and interconnections in this large musical family . i learned what it 's like to have mucic within you -- to write as well as perform . i liked the character developments -- no one all good or all bad , but all very interesting . i recommend this book highly . one learns about us history , country music , human nature , and it 's entertaining to boot
i picked this dvd off the rack as a random selection , mainly because i do n't believe that sean penn has ever appeared in a bad movie .... and this has got to be one of his best ( even though he was probably still a teenager when it was produced in <NUM> ) . he portrays a young delinquent purse snatcher and mugger named mick o'brien , who is rapidly escalating the violence of his crimes . ultimately , during an attempted drug robbery his best friend is murdered and he accidentally runs over the young brother of his bitter enemy , paco moreno ( fairly well portrayed by esai morales .... he is definitely no sean penn ) . because of his youth , mick is sent to a grim , grimy , violent juvenile detention center presided over by the `` usual suspects '' : inattentive , seemingly deaf guards who allow atrocities to be perpetrated daily and with no consequences .... prison trustees ( clancy brown portrays one ) who flaunt the rules , sexually abuse at will , and terrorize the inmates .... and a warden who is a weak , fickle joke . by standing up to the trustees and demonstrating his talents for mayhem and maniacal violence , mick becomes the dominant inmate .... in effect , ruling the place , until two things happen to challenge him : paco rapes mick 's girlfriend ( revenge for the death of his brother ) and gets sentenced to the same juvenile detention center as mick . they now hate each other more than ever , and are trapped within the same hellish institution .... you know that something horrific is going to happen . sorry , but if you want to see how this incredible set-up plays out , you 'll have to rent or buy the dvd .... and i assure you , it will be money well spent . the acting is superb ( sean is incredible , even as a teenager , exuding an undercurrent of barely-controlled violence ) ; the plot is suspenseful and bloody but always makes perfect sense ; the direction , cinematography , sets , sound , etc . are terrific . this is a genuinely excellent movie .... i give it my highest recommendation .
while i believe that the book is masterfully written , i kept asking myself when i was reading it whether ellis had a deal with the devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever . it is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them , see them , almost touch them , they practically scream at you from the pages ; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage . i did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book ; to admire it , to respect it - yes but to enjoy it ... well , there was one woman , mary harron , who liked and respected ap so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked . she cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire . i liked the film when i saw it first time ; i love it now after the second viewing . surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes i 've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards . the show belongs to christian bale - and he delivers as patrick bateman , the rich and beautiful <NUM> year old wall street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes dr. lector look like a sesame street character . bale 's cold , charismatic , misogynist turn is riveting . his james bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly , that your blood would freeze .
`` a fantastic four-hour dvd full of exercises , qigong , meditation , and a short yang style tai chi sequence done to the left and the right . it has simple to follow along to <NUM> minute , <NUM> minute or <NUM> minute workouts , and a long , brilliant instructional section with very detailed guidance through every movement , from basic to advanced . i followed along to the <NUM> minute version sitting down at first , and have worked up to the <NUM> minute standing . this program helps you to regain strength and overall health .

i brought this book to kill some time on holiday . but when i picked it up i could not put it down . bob norris , an experienced naval aviator is also a pretty good author which is not often the case when these millitary types pick up a pen . the novel describes a fly off competition to pick a new fighter/bomber but all is not as it seems as the hosts have a hidden agenda . each fighter/bomber has <NUM> events to prove it 's worth and the one fault this book has is bob should have put more flying sequences into the competion events instead of just giving a brief summary of what they did and the results in some cases . the parts of the novel dealing with the fly offs are top drawer and if you like your aviation in books then read fly off . keep those books coming mr norri
beck 's best at his hippest , funkiest , top . put this cd in your player and a party is virtually bound to start . unlike almost any other pop artist beck oozes talent and imagination . he shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right . each of beck 's new cd 's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there 's a whole lot of fun here . mixed bizness gets my vote for the best .
this book is not only an interesting read , but fun as well ! the pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat , including what tools to use and how to use them . i just ordered <NUM> more copies and ca n't wait to give them to my boating enthusiastic friends ! whether your re-doing a sailboat or not , i would highly recommend this to anybody who 's into boating .
one of thoses rare combinations of perfectly executed content and content perfectly executed . one of the great rock albums not only of that decade but to date . that it was a first album is even more impressive . this is one i go back to again and again .
commander x is the pseudonym used by a person who is reportedly a former u.s. government intelligence agent from the nsa who worked in a remote viewing project . he has distributed a lot of information from alleged personal experiences and insider contacts to provide glimpses of what goes on behind the scenes with ets , the global elite/nwo , mind control , secret technologies , and more . probably the best part of this video is x 's expressed view that we all are connected to the creator and do n't need any religion to intermediate . the video shows scenes of the speaker with his face blacked out , interspersed with a variety of video clips , photos , fractal and kaleidoscopic art , metaphysical drawings , and more . the voice is altered and it 's almost a cliche that the speaker is upsetting folks in the government/nwo by sharing what he knows . obviously , if information is classified then those who have taken an oath to serve government agencies can be dealt with in unpleasant ways for releasing what they have discovered . thus , i think it is unusual for people like x to directly present their findings to the public unless it is being done openly as an approved leak or dissemination of confusing disinfo . the speaker here is disguised [ though it would seem to me that it might not be too hard for the government to identify him and track him down ] . he admits that he does n't have all the answers and seems to be a bit more calm than some other people that have presented their ideas about ets & nwo topics . overall i thought this video was interesting , though i found the organization of images presented to be inadequate at times even while i really liked many of the computer generated fractal , kaleidoscopic , and hypnotic images . this video seems to present information in a more cogent and up-to-date manner than past commander x books , so if you liked the books this video should interest you
i have seasons <NUM> & <NUM> , & could n't wait for the next installment . this was my favorite show when i was a kid . it feels like i grew up with these girls & mrs. garrett was the wise grandma i never had . alot of the episodes now play like those old after-school specials , but i just ca n't resist going back to a more innocent , light-hearted time . it definitely gets nostalgia points & will make you smile
ok i ca n't myself here , but this guy really listened to a lot supertramp growing up or something . i liked to album , but i can hear hints of supertramp 's style in about half the songs here in different degrees . `` bad day '' probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the `` breakfast in america '' album to me . still the album is enjoyable though , especially if you did like supertramp . i get the leo sayer hook , but i think it 's off a bit . leo never used that many keyboards
in the product description it says that this video is for the <NUM> to <NUM> year old age range , but having children in that range myself , i can tell you that this is incorrect . for unlike the other leapfrog videos , this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading , or who have just started reading . i say this from observation of my son ( 3.5 ) and daughter ( 5.5 ) and their friends . those of them that are almost reading , or who are sounding out short words and sentences , understand the importance of punctuation and 'get ' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally ( chunking ) . for the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they have n't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about . five stars . it 's short , but for the right kids it 's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading . young children will watch lily , tad and the gang , but do n't expect them to learn much . but buy this video . if you have the other videos ( which are amazing ) go ahead and get this one to go along with them . when the time is right , your child will just absorb this information like they did their letters
this movie was much better than `` vanilla sky . '' `` vanilla sky '' mostly copied `` open your eyes '' but was too obvious and less convincing . ( and tom cruise , though good in some roles , did n't fit this role well . ) `` open your eyes '' takes a little longer to draw you in , but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where `` vanilla sky '' does . also , the jungian dream aspect in `` vanilla sky '' is poorly done , whereas `` open your eyes '' represents the dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you 're going to buy , get `` open your eyes .
i read this book last year . i was born during the vietnam war and remember little about it . i certainly did not experience the build up before the war . the ugly american had a tremendous influence on american foreign policy back then . it highlighted our arrogance and our vulnerabilities when we forget the importance of understanding other cultures . and president kennedy practically made it mandatory reading for his advisors . what was most interesting to me , however , was how pertinent the book is today . instead of sarkhan or vietnam , the book could be about iraq . regardless of your feelings about the war , the ugly american is enlightening and should remind us how important it is to understand others when we occupy their nation . the book is a short -- but important -- read . i recommend it to everyone . it is a classic not so much because of its language or story . it 's a classic because its message is meaningful even in today 's world
ok ... there may be alot of songs on here that you do n't know from her hollywood films , but do n't let that stop you . she is marvelous and fun ! another reviewer said they were disappointed with this ... ignore them and buy it
during the 80s , the bangles solidified themselves not only as one of the best girl groups , but one of the best groups overall . this cd contains an anthology of their greatest hits and will take you back in time to the 80s . led by susanna hoffs ' melodic vocals , michael steele 's bass , vicki peterson 's guitar , and debbi peterson 's drums , the bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today . this cd is loaded with great songs , including `` going down to liverpool '' , the classic `` manic monday '' , `` if she knew what she wants '' , the # <NUM> `` walk like an egyptian '' , `` hazy shade of winter '' from the movie `` less than zero '' , the upbeat `` in your room '' , and another # <NUM> `` eternal flame '' this greatest hits cd is the perfect collection for the person who does n't want to go out and buy each individual album . all of the best songs are contained in this great single cd . i highly recommend this great disc . listen to this cd and hear one of the best girl groups from the 80s
this is one of the few books that i have come across that focuses mainly on the innards of security assessments . the services based security and counter measures are helpful for threat modeling . this book is really great for people in the security risk and threat analysis for a quantitative and qualitative validation . good book to help in setting up corporate security policy model . other people have already provided a good chapter wise run-down so i will skip that here ... buy this book : )
i am impressed with this book . it 's easy to read and understand , and i learned a lot about the importance of magnesium and how it helps us to function . i have shared this book with friends and family so they can improve their diets and learn how a magnesium deficiency affects their health . my daughter has not had a migraine since she has incorporated this mineral in to her diet . that in itself made the purchase worthwhile . highly recommend
perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers . those who detested it said it was because of the violence . those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts . there are the usual nora roberts fixtures here : a beautiful , independent , tough heroine ; r-rated sex scenes ; handsome and talented lovers ; flowers , etc . it has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts , but there 's nothing very mysterious about it . anyone who does n't know who the arsonist is after the first fire has n't paid much attention . in fact , i kept wanting to tell reena to wake up and go get him . perhaps the biggest departure from ms. roberts ' previous books ( for me , at least ) is the rather humdrum atmosphere . ambience is the writer 's strongest suit in other works -- alaska in winter , an island off boston , chesapeake bay , ireland , louisiana etc . old baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop are n't quite the same . still , the writing is mostly good and i kept reading . a second-rate nora roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today
i 've been listening to soul coughing religiously for years now and was thrilled when this disc was released ( even though i knew i 'd have almost all the material on it ) . although all the songs here are well worthy of being here , i feel there are some songs missing that need to be here . where are `` fully retractable '' and `` i miss the girl '' , two of the funkiest soul coughing tracks ? i am very pleased , however , that `` unmarked hellicopters '' was put on here despite not being on a precious soul coughing release . all in all this is a great disc , and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good overwiew of soul coughing 's music . however , i 'm sure other die hard soul coughing fans will agree that there are some great tunes missing from this disc
this is a good movie with comments to make on many levels . it shows the heartache that one couple has to overcome after losing a child . there is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy , a pleasant , caring woman who has been breaking the law for <NUM> years . then there is the story of two boys who play their rifle games oblivious to what harm they are doing to other people , completely innocent people . does their culture create people , even young ones , who are so irresponsible ? today 's newspapers confirm the film 's answer . . a resounding yes . and , attached to the film 's plot by a very slender thread , the japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her , including the audience . i would n't necessarily call this film enjoyable , but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film . it also has probably the best role that brad pitt has ever had or played .
this movie is so comforting to me . its sweet , funny and def . gives you a message . no matter how green the grass may seem ( a man that has a lot on his plate : kevin bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman ) it 's not always . moral of the story is you need to go with your heart . he realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his `` single self '' i absolutely love this movie . love the music , love the actors , love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby . too funny ! : )
i like this film because several reasons , unlike most of the national lampoon 's i 've recently seen , this was the least silly & disgusting . there was a better plot to it , paris hilton is a fine actor ! alot of people would say she 's playing herself in this movie but if u think that , then u do n't really know her . but i 'm not getting into that . now to the plot , veronica ( hilton ) is the hottest girl in the school , popular , dating the `` hottest '' guy on campus & is totally rich ! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for fhm , she needs the hottest girls to compete with her . only that does n't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate . there is a journey of self-discovery , lessons to be learned but it 's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere . lots of this does n't make sense but who cares . it 's a very cheesy flick but it has humor , nudity , all the things u 'd want from a national lampoon 's flick & i give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film ! i say it 's a good film to see , though maybe not a family film , it 's still worth your time !
j.c. hallman 's the chess artist is structured around a trip that the author took with his friend glenn , the chess player of the book 's title , to kalmykia , a crumbling russian republic on the northwest shore of the caspian sea . hallman was interested in interviewing kalmykia 's despotic president , kirsan ilyumzhinov , a former chess prodigy and the president of the world chess federation ( fide ) , who was using chess `` as a tool to unify and mollify his people . '' ( he had made chess instruction compulsory in schools , for example . ) woven around the story of their journey are chapters on chess history -- its development and geographical migration across a thousand years , the history of its individual pieces -- and hallman 's further adventures with glenn : marathon chess sessions over the internet , formal chess competitions , blindfolded chess and speed chess , chess played in prison and in princeton , and the various characters they ran across on their adventures -- child prodigies and the denizens of dickensian chess shops and the down-and-out chess hustlers of new york 's washington square park . part travelogue , then , and part history , hallman 's book is also an exploration of both the international subculture of competitive chess and of his traveling companion . for most of the period covered by the book , glenn was ranked as a chess master -- exceptionally good but well below the grandmasters who form the true elite of the chess world . glenn is an enigmatic character . a germophobic 39-year-old with a genius for the game and poor grammar , he is apparently incapable of consistently making smart decisions in the real world . divorced and perpetually broke , almost childish at times , his friendship seems to be to a great extent a burden . hallman has a tendency , actually , to write about glenn as if he were a sort of lab animal , whose mannerisms and mode of play are alike under scrutiny . `` he shrugged and performed a gesture that was new to me , opening his palms suddenly and at the same time contorting his face to an expression of exaggerated surprise . '' annoying and strange , given to marking promising relationships with ceremonial whistling , glenn is also a sad figure , a broken man `` spiraling toward nothingness , a waste of twenty years of effort and energy . '' one wonders what glenn thought of his presentation in the book . the chess artist is very well researched and thick with information . and it is punctuated by some truly wonderful , sometimes poetic writing : `` the train was all lullaby , the gyroscopic jostle of the tracks , the steady click of the wheels like the eighth notes of some slower melody , the stars stationary out the small window , all of it a lull of travel nostalgia , a cradle or warm womb , glenn and i like twins incubating in that cramped space . '' in kalmykia hallman is served `` a genocide of crayfish '' ; in a prison cafeteria the fare is instead `` hockey pucks of meat like the leftover scrapings of a botched autopsy . '' one chess player they observe has the `` eyebrows of a demon , '' while another is `` a nondescript man who fit the profile of a serial killer -- short , well-groomed , quiet , and very dangerous . '' hallman 's writing is riddled with such evocative descriptions . this is both wonderful and , surprisingly perhaps , problematic : the problem is that hallman tends to lavish his well-written descriptions on nearly every minor character who crosses his path , so that the reader is met with too much information . hallman 's flair is obvious . but after a time , the personalities in the book tend to blend together . it is tempting to say that hallman does for chess what stefan fatsis does for scrabble in his book word freak , exposing the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime , the obsessives who sacrifice sleep and hygiene over their chosen game . hallman 's book , though , is a more serious and more difficult read . presumably , the more familiar a reader is with chess , the more he will get out of the book . i myself do not play , but i was able to understand and appreciate , at least on some level , most of what the author had to say . non-chess players should not be afraid of diving in . debra hamel -- author of trying neaira : the true story of a courtesan 's scandalous life in ancient greece ( yale university press , <NUM>
this is an excellent debut from mindy . her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good . & quot ; guys do it all the time & quot ; is a fun slap in the face for all those & quot ; macho & quot ; types out there , the title song is my favourite though , but all are good , from the love songs to the fun songs . i hope she stays true to her roots though , and does n't go the way of leann rimes and faith hill . one thing i have never understood though , is why nearly all country cds are limited to <NUM> tracks . this one for example is only <NUM> minutes long . rock and pop cds quite often exceed <NUM> songs but country albums rarely even exceed <NUM> . anyway , thats just an observation , and does n't take away from the worth of this album . recommended
so i 'm sitting in a west village cafe opposite a beautiful young writer , and she 's friends with a guy named eli cooper who seems to be living a dream life as a children 's book author . he 's just written his first non-watercolor-painted book on fatherhood , she has it , and do n't i want to check it out ? i do n't know if i do . will i be jealous of his writing ? should i trust this review by this other guy ? parenthood is n't something i 'm rushing into . even a book about it raises my heartbeat . ( i 'm married but childless . for now . ) reading the first two chapters floors me instantly . this is not at all what i expected . how do you make fresh what so many other people have tried to write ? well , this elisha guy succeeds . mr. cooper writes with such a natural tone it 's like listening to an old friend just kind of chuckling over the phone . at the same time , his observations are sharp , cutting , and hilarious . this is the good stuff . i 'm buying it . go get it !
this is the only book any photographer should read . it tells you every kind of career there is in photojournalism and more . descriptions on how to do everything from selling pictures to agencies to holding on to your self in a world that demands that you change along with it
this book shows children that one person can make a positive impact on the world , and that god is with them even during the bad times of their lives . it was squanto 's faith in god that helped him forgive europeans for kidnapping him , and it was his faith in god that made him decide to help the pilgrims . the spiritual aspect of squanto 's life is too important to leave out when we pass this story down to our children
i have seen this wonderful film in hollywood , new york and wasington d.c. and it never disappoints . there is so much in it that it is always interesting and a joy to watch . there are many fascinating persnalities -- both the chasen 's staff and old hollywood personalities-and they are portrayed with amazing sensitivity , humor and intelligence
i love this show it 's my favorite show on saturday afternoon but it 's sad that they cancelled this show now i have nothing looking forward too on saturday afternoon only work but that 's it . i love brennan he 's the coolest with his electricity powers aka as the elemental . then there 's emma but she had left the show in season <NUM> her psyonic powers were cool . then comes jesse and that new girl i forgot her name have n't seen the show lately . then there 's shalimar i like her powers but it 's not my favorite out of all these peoples . i ca n't wait for season <NUM> and season <NUM> to come out in box set because buying it seperate cd 's costs alot of money
wake up paramount ! take a cue from your sales on the sttng sets . now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the first place , i would imagine that all of the hold-outs ( like me ) are now buying them . see , it works like this , <NUM> minute shows on dvd , for a season , have earned a market fair price of $ 25-35 . so , since star trek episodes are an hour long , that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $ 50-70 range . so , $ <NUM> is your sweet spot . you will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points , but everyone else looks at your current price tags , especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us , and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop . so , do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people , drop the price to where it is supposed to be , and earn your sales . nobody sane is going to pay more than $ <NUM> for a season of an hour long/episode tv show on dvd , period
absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times . i bought this album because it was listed as one of the top <NUM> guitar albums of all time in guitar player magazine . you get lightning in a bottle here with bb king at the height of his powers . the audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to bb king 's rendition of some blues classics . his voice is flawless , still velvety smooth , especially when compared with later live albums by bb king . there is the perfect mixture of bb king 's introductions or setups for each tune , guitar , vocals and audience reaction . the sound is immaculate , balanced and clear . his guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect . it makes you wonder why more recent `` live albums '' lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording . the only regret is the album is not longer .
for those who enjoy the challenge of reading high theory but are put off by the dry , abstract , pretentious ramblings that more often than not constitute theoretical writing , zizek is the theorist for you . is there another theorist alive who can on one page explicate the finer points of lacan , hegel and kant , while on the next page tie it all in with the three most popular female pubic hair styles , homosexual ; and subtle distinctions among toilet designs in germany , france , and the united states ? perhaps . but zizek makes these seemingly awkward transitions and uncommon examples quite smoothly ; the outrageous examples are n't forced , nor are they merely for & quot ; shock & quot ; value . in short , they work to clarify the difficult concepts he is discussing . although zizek is not what i 'd call an easy read - not by a long shot - he certainly knows how to make a challenge a bit less stressful and - gasp ! - fun . en
i had to read a biography so i picked an amazing artist , george harrison behind sad eyes teels his life from his small years to his sad death a must read for any beatles fan ~tinkerbell queen bonezi
... the fact that out of <NUM> reviews <NUM> are 5star says alot about this dvd . im not going to go off on one about this as i dont have time to ( i know i 'd get carried away as theres so much to comment on this ) but basically i thought the morning view sessions were a good demonstration of incubus live , volume <NUM> is great , especially the live cali-accoustic tracks ( awesome ) but this concert is unbelievable , so so good ! highlights for me are for a start seeing alot of the crow left of the murder tracks live as the album is brilliant & has grown on me so much over time , but also just seeing how well incubus can improvise & adapt their songs to sound even better live . theres a great version of `` drive '' here , but the lengthened versions of `` sick , sad lille world '' & `` a certain shade of green '' are amazing . the guitar work on `` s , s l w '' , `` priceless '' & `` pistola '' is brilliant . other greatly performed trackes include `` wish you were here '' ( such an anthem nowadays ) , `` here in my room '' , `` made for tv movie '' ( a new favourite of mine ) & `` talk shows on mute '' . also very cool to see `` pantomine '' live , its also on the bonus cd , along with a couple live tracks & a couple of non-album tracks . im hoping to get to the leeds festival this summer ( if i can blag a ticket somehow ) so very much looking forward to seeing them even if it is only for an hour ! theyre the best band in the world in my opinion . basically buy this if you love incubus , its the best dvd you can get of them ...
i first picked this up out of the bargain bin at the video store . i was mostly interested in the music . i had seen another movie with a cajun story line called `` southern comfort '' and discovered i loved the music . so , i bought belizaire b/c i wanted to have the music . and make no mistake , the music is great ! but i was majorly surprised at how wonderful the movie is ! i stand in agreement with the other reviewers - this is well worth owning . its one you 'll want to see repeatedly . i know i still enjoy it every time i watch it , and its been many times over the years .
this dvd showcases some of the best visual artist talent in the vj and nightlife industry today all mixed to some killer trance music . all of the visuals are stunning except i am not a big fan of the contributions made by bionic dots . they seem to be overly paranoid about showcasing their work so they obnoxiously brand their content with annoying info bars across the bottom of the screen . the video content is great as is for playing at parties or can be utilized as source material by any interested vj in mnay creative ways . this dvd is well worth a purchase for anyone that has been mesmerized by video screens at a top nightclub or underground party - highly recommended eye candy
this is undoubtedly my favorite cd of the last decade and definitely sarah brightman 's best effort to date ! her duets with andrea bocelli and jose cura are outstanding ! i especially love ' o mio babbino caro ' , alleluja ' , and 'la wally ' . sarah 's uniquely sensual style is evident in the incredibly beautiful 'bilitis - generique ' , 'no one like you ' and 'just show me how to love you ' . close your eyes and drift away ... it is highly unusual for me to like every song on a cd , but on 'time to say goodbye ' , i do . it has a unique way of making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me to sing along at the same time . it 's long past time for a sequel to this wonderful album
if you like mystery 's with a twist , this movie is pretty good . if you are offended easily by certain subjects , language , or sexual situations , i would not recommend this movie as it is quite graphic and vulgar
the music of the free design was a part of the fabric of my life in the late 60's/early <NUM> 's . the intricate harmonies and intimate feelings shared by this family somehow cut through the psychedelic pomposities of the time and did what my favorite music always does : it makes you feel great ! to possess a new cd by the fd in the new millenium is nothing short of a miracle . the sound is unchanged : the layered vocals , the floating interjections of flute and recorder , the challenging compositions of chris dedrick are all intact . missing in action is the beguiling voice of ellen , although co-producer rebecca pellet deputizes well for her . bruce 's pipes are a bit rustier than before , but chris ' delight in recollaborating with his brother is evident . it 's so grand to hear music this honest , without a hint of gadgetry or synthesizer . track <NUM> , & quot ; the hook & quot ; , makes a sly dig at the triumph of machine over man in today 's pop scene ....... it 's the & quot ; cute & quot ; tune of the set . standout songs include the title tune and & quot ; mccarran airport & quot ; , kind of a & quot ; leaving on a jet plane & quot ; for the 2000s . if you like the free design at all , you should be enjoying this cd as soon as possible without compunction . if you are unfamiliar with the group , order the & quot ; best of & quot ; or the too-expensive japanese issue of & quot ; you could be born again & quot ; along with & quot ; cosmic peekaboo & quot ; ......... you wo n't be sorry . if all free design fans purchase the new set , maybe we 'll persuade the dedricks to continue their excellence with further new recordings . i certainly hope so . music like this is too precious to take for granted
two for the road is a true sixties comedydrama in every sense of the word . it is also one of the best roadmovies up to date . it is a funny , dramatic and an absolute pleasure to watch that will stay in your mind for some time . starring the lovely audrey hepburn and the funny albert finney , the story follows a married couple who 's flame of relationship has burnt out . the marriage is on the rocks while flashbacks show how their relationship began while both were travelling through europe . the director , stanley donen ( who also directed hepburn in funny face ( <NUM> ) and in charade ( <NUM> ) ) has made a film that is a true masterpiece . the way the movie is cut and edited is absolutely fasenating and makes the film very great to watch . you will be swinging around from one situation to the next in absolute joy . the characters are great , the situations fun and the romance is delicious . next to those comedic moments there is also a chunk of drama in the film . it fits perfectly and does n't feel like it is unnecessary next to the comedy , which is another element that makes the film wortwhile to take a look at . the film is ballanced just fine and is n't hanging too much in one direction . considering artdirection the movie is true eyecandy . beautiful , colorful locations are seen throughout the film with an even more beautiful audrey hepburn . this film made her the true fashion icon of the sixties . she is prefectly dressed in every single scene and made women all over the world want to be like her even more . her acting is once again grand , you just ca n't go wrong with hepburn . you 'll be charmed and enchanted by her looks , personality and that big shiney smile . albert finney plays hepburn 's husband , a fun role . he acts great and makes you love him or hate him in the various situations . he is believable even though he is pushing his performance to the beginning of being unbelievable , which brings great fun to watch and a memorable performance . the music of the famous henri manchini ( breakfast at tiffany 's , charade , the pink panter ) is beautiful and fits the film perfectly . emotions are made stronger , situations are made funnier and even more romantic then they already are by this fasenating soundtrack . the main theme will be playing in your mind for some time after seeying this film . so the film is a true enjoyment for both eye and ear . it entertains you , wether by the story , locations , music , that lovely audrey hepburn or that funny albert finney . it wants you to travel with them and long to the sixties . two for the road is a masterpiece that will leave you with that smile on your face that you want to have when looking for entertainment .
i 've read this book a few times , and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories , wicked satire , and twisted plots . perhaps it 's not everyone 's cup of tea ( as other reviews have shown ) but i loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting ( a la wilkie collins or palliser 's own quincunx ) and send-ups of modern literary theory , in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader , and such luminaries as jeffery archer , seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist . i am not a fan of books as puzzles , but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction ; it 's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection
nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel . a large part of conrad 's achievement is his fusion of these <NUM> elements into one seamless narrative . nostromo describes the penetration of a latin american country by european/north american capitalism and the ensuing revolution . all the characters in nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward . conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary latin america and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping . the psychological elements concern characters ' motivations for their acts . a recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se . unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character , nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by conrad . the focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot , a brilliant piece of formal construction . finally , nostromo features some of conrad 's best descriptive writing . because of the complexity of the plot and characterization , nostromo is not the easiest of conrad 's novels to read . nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended
john goodman is king . this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . dirty , raunchy , and completely unsuitable for teenage viewing , this movie makes it fun to remember what it was like when comedies actually contained full frontal female nudity ! the locker room speech by john goodman is one of the funniest things i have ever heard . buy this movie now ! p.s . `` what is hairpie ? '' or `` step aside mama , i wan na see some of that muff '' .
i first heard a `` somethin ' bout love '' on the radio and had to have it . then i heard the entire cd and it blew me away with its smooth , sexy feel . this cd is the one to play next time you are spending an intimate evening with the one you love .... thank you brian for giving us this sensual set
i have follow ana throught her beginnings as a member of the spanish pop band mecano and became very intrigue by her angel like voice and absolutely progressive themes in her earlier years with the band . i very much anticipated a new release from mecano but when i heard the band had split up assumed that her career was over . i was very delighted to hear she had went on as a solo and knew that her new cd would probably become a new classic in my cd collection . i found every song in this release as pleasing as all her former recordings
this is without a doubt the best texas music album i 've ever heard , and quite possibly my favorite cd i own . i just do n't get tired of it . there 's simply not a weak song on the album , and there 's a good variety of upbeat songs as well as slower , more somber ones . pick this one up .
without the soulful voice of richard manuel , this album would be drowning in mor . but he lifts the music into an indescribably emotional area - right as rain , georgia on my mind particularly . he performed almost the same miracle on northern lights , southern cross . maybe islands contains markedly inferior songs and some lacklustre performances , but it is nowhere near as bad as it has been painted . listen to richard ...
this movie pictured a sizable segment of the u.s. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement mediterranean family . many italians i know said that it could have been their family . the movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted . i enjoyed the wry humor . at the beginning i was prepared to hate her father . he was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual . and the women of the family were so cynically manipulative . it did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid . he had only the best in mind for his family , and that included his daughters , and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the united states . one other detail pleased me ; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world . not only do they learn academic things , they meet wonderful people from other cultures there , fall in love , and marry them . the photography was wonderful and the acting was superb , especially since the movie was made on a tight budget . this is one of the best films i have seen in the past ten years .
a very simple story of a very simple guy who follows his hormones to self-delusion and destruction . he does not make relationships but always keeps women just close enough for his hedonist fulfillment and in the end realizes he is only fooling himself . an admiring friend provides the mirror that helps him see himself as he really is . but can the love of his life ever trust him or has he burned all his bridges too late to recover what really matters ? a good lesson on relationships and the price of a promiscuous life .
this is an excellent study of what goes on in the mind of the suicidal client . it is also a beautiful and unforgettable book . i found it touching and illuminating and it has had a profound impact on the way i treat such clients in therapy . i only thought i understood their psychological pain , but i am more accepting and empathic since reading this incredibly moving book . required reading for all therapists
this is a chilly saga of an american sub captain plagued by failure-prone weapons and an ocean full of japanese to fight . they find the reason the torpedoes did n't work and put back to sea , this time , to take good care of the nasty business at hand . one scene that brings the cost of war home is that the thunderfish loaned another sub a movie , & quot ; washington slept here. & quot ; sometime later , they find wreckage of an american sub , and the movie tells them who is at the bottom of the ocean . the thunderfish strikes back at the sub that got their friends , showing how dangerous it was out there and what courage it took to fight this war . the climax scene shows them in a japanese-controlled harbor , with a waiting task force . they fire their new and deadly torpedoes , and radio back to cincpac about the taskforce and its location . they run for cover , and barely survive massive retaliation : the outcome is in doubt until the last , as it was for many other submariners . a moving , poignant , and bittersweet tale that stresses the fact that nothing ever comes for free , even in war
my husband has really enjoyed anything he has read by clive cussler . he reads every one he can find
even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book , which is a compilation of several of mkf fisher 's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin , recipes , culinary preparation , and history . in addition , it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs , etiquette , ambience , socializing and so forth . but what makes this book stellar is the eloquent , imaginative , and sometimes even haunting style of ms. fisher 's writing . she expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions , mixing them with historical facts , tempting recipes , and home-cooked tales . with such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers , it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining . i wish i had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food , eating , and drinking , which after all are such basic elements to our very existence . the section i enjoyed most of all was `` the gastronomical me '' , a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes . she includes food episodes of her early years in california while growing up and later attending boarding school ; in dijon , france where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings ; in switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the alps to italy ; and finally in a small mexican town , where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories , by telling the most poignant tales . an interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food . you gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics , from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon , which she keeps in a flask during a long , propeller-driven , airplane flight to mexico . the other sections i liked were the beginning ( serve it forth ) and consider the oyster . it amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster : the various types , methods of preparations , and culinary history . plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too . you name it , she said it about oysters -- recipes included . i did not care as much for how to cook a wolf , as i could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented . ( sorry , but sweetbreads , halves of calf heads , and brains were not appetizing subjects . ) also , i gave up finishing the book . i started to read `` an alphabet for gourmets '' , the last section , but got as far as `` d '' and could n't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet . it seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter , to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending . this section was such a let-down , a depressant to me after coming off the high of `` the gastronomical me '' . although i exaggerate , she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people ( with untrained palettes ) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second . anyway , other readers may disagree with me , but this last section lacks the consistency , and more important , the vibrancy and pep of her flowing , off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections . although i was a little disheartened at the end , her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives . i can recommend this book to everyone , especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat . of course , foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it . and though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses , this should not be considered a cookbook ; instead , this book 's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy .
this is the best <NUM> 's metal compilation ever ! i remember when i was in 1st grade , and i played this cd over and over ! there is not one bad song on this cd ! i still have it , and it 's all scratched up ! i think i need to buy another copy
from here to eternity , where to begin ? this is probably one of my top <NUM> movies that i 've ever seen . i love it ! frank sinatra is wonderful in it ; montgomery clift is gorgeous , vulnerable , and brave in this movie ; burt lancaster is awesome , as everyone who has ever seen him could tell you . this movie shows a clear depiction of the soldiers at pearl harbor before it was bombed . the book is a totally long , obnoxious book , towards the end i only read the quotations . the movie totally changed the book and made it wonderful . this is a classic , and will be for the rest of time
melanie white and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to `` appalachia waltz . '' i highly recommend oliver schroer 's double-disc `` o2 '' . same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin . in places astoundingly brilliant . lovers of bach will see many influences here ( yet i would n't call schroer 's work derivative . ) in the liner notes , schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal -- funny thing is , the more you listen , the more `` fractal '' it sounds . unbelievable .
prince 's <NUM> album controversy is another classic album in his catalog . the title track is the standout immediately . this longer version than the single version features a prayer . the song is funky and effective . `` sexuality '' is a great disco/funk number . `` do me , baby '' is probably one of the sexiest songs he 's ever done . this full length version is the one to hear . `` private joy '' is another funky song which is another favorite on the album . `` ronnie , talk to russia '' is a short protest kind of song . same goes for `` annie christian '' , which he wrote about the shooting of john lennon , ronald reagan , various atlanta child murders . not as effective as `` ronnie , talk to russia '' but a decent track nonetheless . overall a highlight in prince 's career
alison mcghee 's story is about <NUM> year-old rose surviving a collision in which she and her older sister , ivy , were innocent victims . rose agonizes throughout ivy 's lengthy hospitalization , and the accident is replayed over & over ; also the mother 's 'coping mechanisms ' - keeping her hands busy while her mind and heart can not allow the release of ivy from the hospital 's life lines . this is a heart-wrenching story , like a movie that must be seen again and again - my reading became skimming at times : i identified rose as a middle-schooler & did n't want her story to tell young girls that sex is a good release from the agony of being alive ; nor is it safe , or without other consequences . ( i was never comfortable about the time our daughters spent on the school bus ! ) mcghee 's characters became a part of my life , not to be sloughed off easily . ( do n't miss her other teen novel , `` snap '' - - also excellent reading for adults . ) reviewer mchaiku agrees with the judges for minnesota 's <NUM> book awards that the author 's `` poetic text authentically and movingly reflects the thoughts and actions of a teen who is desperately trying to salvage her life . '' alison mcghee 's writing , and the characters that developed strengths , the quotes which melded to become prime movers for the telling , and the friends who cultivated the writer 's talents - - all are to be admired . ( p.s . : i do wonder why alison mcghee left the adirondacks for minnesota ? ! )
when i first saw it i got disapointed for the size of the book . i realized how good it was when i started reading it . it 's amazing how much information was placed into such a little thing
... i must have done something good . this cd truly is a gift . i 've always been of the opinion that sweeney todd is sondheim 's best work . certainly my favorite . so to have it revisited to this magnitude gives me delicious validation . the performances are flawless , and their voices pay beautiful tribute to their theatrical predecessors . i am a compulsive collector of musicals on cds ( <NUM> at last count ) however , i am no expert on the intricacies of the craft , i just know what i like . this cd clearly pushes to the front of my collection and takes its place alongside les miserables , rent and the producers . if you are even considering purchasing this , do it , thank me later
the book is simply superb ! ! the use of those magnificent photos to enhance the story was the crowning glory to a story that i not only believe , but experience in my own spirit . it is time for the glorious feminine to rise again and , hopefully , repair the damage done to humanity by the mutated females - men . lois c. web
my students love numb3rs . they tell me they would have never watched this at home if they had not been introduced to it in my class . they are very interested in `` non-school '' applications of math and since they catch the `` bad guy '' every week , i consider this character education . you see , i teach in a secure juvenile detention facility
this is the start to a story that will bring every emotion out of you . the characters , landscapes , different worlds , languages , fantasy , majic all tie in together and create a simply wonderful journey for a reader . to read this book and the entire story , please keep an open mind , let your imagination runn wild , and remember that this is a story that came out of a writer who struggled with this for <NUM> years yet he leaves enough for you to decided a lot of things for yourself . all the loose ends become tied together so keep reading . but above all read the books for the story not the ending , but i promise you 'll be suprised and hopefully as i was , incredibly enlightened .
mix master mike has really worked on his beats this time . i give him props for that . what i miss is like a scratch-theme in each track like dj revolution , dj premier are doing using acapellas and making own lyrics , sentences with it . overall the album is ok , but not a classic .
a book about the show that revolutionized the sports tv show by the two guys who were the stars of the show . funniest section is where they talk about those little catch-phrases everyone gets stuck in their head . you know like , & quot ; from way downtown ... bang ! ! & quot ; and & quot ; he put the biscuit in the basket & quot ; . hilarious !
one of the joys of reading fiction is in the people you meet on the way . the truly great books have you almost grieving for the characters to whom you must say goodbye as you close the book . so it is with the gold bug variations - i miss ressler too . you 'll read the prose that approaches poetry , the virtuosity , the contrapuntal style ( not contrapunctal , as one reviewer put it ) , and the breadth of subject material . all of these delight and dazzle , but with ressler , powers reaches the heart
this movie is an old classic . i used to love this movie when i was a child , so i bought it and my friends and i were laughing at sho'nuff with his big ugly self . and now my children like it as well . yep , this one 's a keeper
mariah carey is one of the all-time best singers in music history . her ability to hit typically unfathomable notes is , of course , her trademark and signature ; but unlike some of her contemporaries , especially the late 90s and early 2000s pop stars like britney spears , her singing is the reason for her popularity , as it should be for any singer . her # <NUM> 's is a great cd , as are many compilation records by artists because they feature their big hits and not the filler from the actual studio releases . impressively , carey has had an incredible amount of singles but also an amazing number of no . <NUM> 's , more than any other female artist and rivaling only the beatles and elvis presley . even though # <NUM> 's is not meant to be a greatest hits package ( as carey has said in the enclosed album art ) like her official greatest hits cd released several years later , it certainly comes off as one . mariah 's voice remains powerful throughout the years as heard on # <NUM> 's . brilliant -- certainly worth purchasing because it compiles the sound that made the 1990s
this film is a true classic - it captures a time , place , and mood with remarkable clarity , but moreover , it predicted the future with amazing prescience . everyone involved in the communications revolution should know about `` tpc '' and `` arlington hewes '' .
i 'm updating my review , because i think the first draft was skimpy , and i feel like i have a better view of this book now that more time has passed since my first reading . the crux of the book is guskin 's concept of `` taking it off the page . '' this was extremely valuable to me , and it turned cold readings from being scary to being my favorite part of the acting process ! `` taking it off the page '' is applicable to rehearsals , too , though , and to freshening up ongoing performances . the book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting : auditions , rehearsals , sit-coms , serials , small roles , big roles , touring , film acting . i think guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations . the book is too short to teach all details for any of these , though , so you will need other sources . the book is very important to me , and my first experience with it was that i read it , and my very next rehearsal was the best rehearsal i had ever had . i felt so free , it was amazing . that is his main objective , to free you up to enjoy and explore .

breaking through to teens : a new psychotherapy for the new adolescence is a cutting-edge psychology book by award-winning academic author ron taffel , ph.d. , founder of family and couples treatment services at the institute for contemporary psychotherapy in new york city . breaking through to teens blends crucial insights into teen culture with the hard-earned knowledge of what can get through to the troubled adolescents of today 's world . from the basic conditions kids need to feel `` held '' , to clear means for breaking through parent-teen gridlock , to creating `` flexible confidentiality '' , and getting teens to speak up , breaking through to teens is extremely valuable both as a parenting resource and as a professional sourcebook of general understanding and specific techniques for youth psychologists and family counselors . highly recommended especially for psychology reference shelves .
most artists or groups suffer the notorious sophmore flop . ( 1st lp off the hook , second not even close ) however , i felt like they 've improved off their first release . beatwise this is one of the most head-noddin albums they 've dropped . production was flawless . lyrics seem to have improved as well . go cop this and support quality hip hop music . a+
i felt sorry for that poor man in the wheel chair , when he did all that for something he was n't involved in ..
jonathan kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years , particularly the alex delaware novels . this - non-delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end . the only reason i did n't give it a <NUM> star rating is because of the slow beginning . i even put it down a time or two thinking i 'd never get where he was going , but i 'm glad i persisted . it turned out to be very well worth it . this is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim . eh ? got the hairs standing up ? he is befriended ( in an odd circumscribed manner ) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening . as the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he 's not sure who to ascribe them to . this is a well plotted , very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning . kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery . loved it !
well , i get this cd only a few days ago in november <NUM> . i was surprised about quality of his voice and of the entire cd . he had the ability to create music of a certain type without being repetitive . i especially appreciate `` til i get over you '' , `` the only one for me '' and the title track `` anytime '' . so dim the lights , hold tight your girl and let the music play ....
it 's a thrill when a veteran musician puts it all together and every track is a keeper . jimmy smith plays to his strengths ( great organ riffs ) and gets help from a lot of equally talented friends . great vocals on this album , sax and guitar . a real pleasure , among my top jazz albums . if you you 're a long time jazz fan or looking to buy your first jazz album , jimmy smith dotcom blues ought to be on the top of your want list
the american frontier shifts north to alaska in this tightly paced anthony mann western , starring jimmy stewart as a hard-bitten , cynical cowboy loner who finds himself caught up in the klondike gold rush , and with it , the struggle between lawless injustice and the budding new civility . walter brennan gets a choice role as stewart 's stammering , old-timer sidekick ; john mcintyre is delicious as the unrepentant villain , judge gannon of the border town called skagway , who runs the place as his own personal company town . stewart plays his antihero to the hilt , and the on-location cinematography is impressive ... a nice , taut , enjoyable film
this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices . he hit the time , the place and the kids perfectly . this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share , i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about <NUM> billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me ... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world . i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday . its a great movie and i 'd recommend it to anyone . you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about .... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which is n't as bad as it sounds . plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell . its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the <NUM> 's over this era .
i had my doubts , but it turns out this film experience ca n't be denied . it 's formulaic , but also wiggy and raw and simply engrossing . damn funny as well . the acting and dramatic elements are consistently strong , and there 's no denying that terrence howard is an immensely talented and nuanced actor .
bruce dickinson is one of the greatest performers of our time . not only is he fronting one of the greatest metal bands ( iron maiden , in case anybody did n't know ) , but he is also an accomplished solo artist , as well as a master fencer and airline pilot . bruce can do it all and he is'nt slowing down ! anthology is a must have for bruce completists . as far as i can tell , everything is here . <NUM> concerts , videos and interviews all on <NUM> dvds . most of this stuff i 've not seen before or it has been a long time since i have seen it . such as the shows . most of the videos i have not seen . mtv does not play the good stuff and niether does anyone else , so if you have'nt seen the videos , this set is for you . bruce conveys an intelligence that a lot of metal performers do n't exhibit . he stands above the rest and is certainly an individual muscian that is'nt afraid to try new things . if you 're into maiden and bruce 's solo stuff , you will like this set . also , roy z. , dickinson 's producer and guitarist is phenominal . adrian smith is always a joy to watch and all of bruce 's different solo bands spout great musicians . bruce is a god
i loved this show when it was on tv originally . it 's so nice to see it again . eventually i 'll have to get the other seasons on dvd
this contains a wonderful and inspiring group of selections and is very well done . the title number accompanies an extremely good picture montage by gcs distributing.com which contains pictures of the military in iraq and is a great emotion grabber . this album is well worth buying and listening to over and over . stephe
having reached this stage of the 3rd and final season of classic trek , i find myself wishing someone would put this dying horse to sleep out of mercy . it was truly heart-wrenching for this fan of tos to have to make myself watch through the entire 3rd season with its many ups and far too many more downs while remembering the great acting , scriptwriting and overall quality of the first two seasons and here in what would be the 3rd last volume of the 3rd season , we get two average quality episodes . for the first episode , `` the way to eden '' , one has to put the episode and hence the story into the context of the times i.e . <NUM> . obviously , taken in today 's context the episode is ridiculously bad but for an audience in <NUM> , the plot has deep meaning what with the civil rights movement and the growing dissension against the vietnam war , that audience could definitely relate to this parable of those very troubling events of their time . viewed from that context , i think this is actually not too bad an episode which tries to show the points of view of the various parties involved : the demonstrators ( adam and the rest ) , the sympathisers ( spock ) and the non-sympathisers ( scott and kirk ) . i thought taken as an overall episode , this metaphor of the major civil demonstrations of the late <NUM> 's was very good . the moral is that one should fight for what is right but one should also beware of being made a tool for someone else 's agenda who may not have as pure an intention as you . so why do i still rate this average ? because , i too did n't like the far too frequent outbreaks of pop ditties ala love or the zombies that adam breaks into . still , an average episode overall . for the second episode , there were some pluses and some minuses as well . the plot that sounds a lot like the idea from which the whole `` highlander '' series came about is a good one but what i do n't understand is why daly 's character becomes jealous of kirk and an android ! also , just because a man is immortal why does that automatically make him have to be the greatest geniuses of history ? this is why the `` highlander '' series that this episode spawned is far more believable for me ; that individual was just a normal immortal trying hard to suppress his immortality to avoid persecution and not einstein or newton or my grandpa . still , for giving us the whole `` highlander '' premise , this makes it to the average category of me . overall , this volume falls under the `` nice to have but not essential '' category if you are deciding which volumes to keep
this is a very useful tool for real estate agents , & the letter templates are good . my only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer . if it had been a cd instead of a floppy , it would have been much better . nothing wrong with the material , i can recommend the letters , but some computers do n't even come with floppy drives anymore . if they 'd switch to a cd , then they 'd have a winner .
the year is <NUM> and there is no war and no crime . corporations have taken the place of governments and the masses are entertained through a sport of modern-day gladiators on skates and speeding motorcycles where only the strongest may someday retire in peace . though released in <NUM> , rollerball has stood the test of time due to the forward-thinking of the writers within the sci-fi/sports realms and using the setting to describe the age-old conflict of the individual versus a corrupt society . jonathan e - played by james caan - is becoming bigger than the game and it is strongly suggested to him by energy corporation executive bartholomew - john houseman - that he should retire . jonathan e can not bring himself to abandon his teammates & leave the game - a retirement party finds the superstar not following his script - which leads to a match that degenerates into a vicious life & death struggle to be the last player standing . the game is already brutal enough before the last game - played on a track , with the object to place a metal ball into a cylinder to score points - as teams named for major cities actually compete for corporations . the action sequences are brilliant and the drama of the last game is chilling . and that contest ultimately brings - on the track , at least - victory without a real winner .
andrei rublyov ( <NUM> ) by andrei tarkovsky is my number <NUM> ( shares with tarkovsky 's zerkalo ) film of all time . it is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever . the beauty of every frame is exquisite - i have to pause film very often just to admire it.there are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as andrei rublyov did . i am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for tarkovsky , it is very well paced , and i am never tired of its 3+ hours running time . film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter andrei rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism , and later by tatar invaders . tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film : what is talent and how an artist is responsible for it ? the man and god , the artist and the power . the final <NUM> minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring i 've seen in the cinema . for me , the last chapter of the film , `` the bell '' is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made . i ca n't stay calm and collected when i see it . boriska sobbing like a child after his bell rings - and he is a child , a boy , lonely and lost ; andrei breaking his vows of silence , his words to boriska of hope , of many roads they would walk together . andrei 's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire , their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity , their melodic lines and pure joyful colors , the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery , quiet knowledge and sadness , looking inside themselves and inside our very souls ; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this earth , to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the `` swiftest birds '' of pain and death ca n't reach you ...
this movie is so comforting to me . its sweet , funny and def . gives you a message . no matter how green the grass may seem ( a man that has a lot on his plate : kevin bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman ) it 's not always . moral of the story is you need to go with your heart . he realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his `` single self '' i absolutely love this movie . love the music , love the actors , love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby . too funny ! : )
another good cd from jimmy ! need to keep the studio cd 's coming and not take so long between . this cd has a great mixture of vocals from several country stars and some good tunes with buffett solo . trip around the sun with martina is great
the debate over the performance of j.s . bach 's cantatas boils down to the following : the evidence suggests that bach only had one singer per part for performances of his cantatas . thus , any historically accurate performance of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach . at the same time , however , there is additional evidence that bach wanted more performers . we are thus stuck with deciding whether bach wrote for the musical forces he had on hand ( which seems logical enough ) or whether he composed for the performers he would like to have ( which would seem silly , if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions . on the other hand , bach does make & quot ; solo & quot ; and & quot ; tutti & quot ; distinctions in the score ... draw your own conclusions ) . rifken is a strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach , which may seem a little sparse at first . yet , when one listens to the various cantatas on these disks , one must confess that these sound , well , beautiful . this may not be an approach which would work for all of bach 's works , but the effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity . regardless of where you fall -- and if you fall -- in the strenuous debates over historical performance , i would heartily recommend this disk . not only are the performances polished , but the works themselves are exquisite -- a wonderful sampling of bach 's cantatas . ( personally i am addicted to the duet , & quot ; wir eilen mit schwachen , doch emsigen schritten & quot ; from bwv <NUM> which i could gladly listen to over and over -- listen to it and you will see why .
i guess after hearing the fifth volume in the buddha bar series , my expectations of chill out compilations have been raised . i have been spoiled by the diversity of the well-knowned chill out series . so when i bought nettwerk 's & quot ; chillout <NUM> : the ultimate chillout & quot ; , i thought it could have been better and less predictable . as much as i love moby and his song & quot ; in this world & quot ; and sasha 's & quot ; wavy gravy & quot ; , i thought those two songs could have easily been left off this cd . on the other hand hearing a new song from & quot ; delerium ( & quot ; love & quot ; ) and a remix of my favorite conjure one song & quot ; tears from the moon & quot ; made it well worth buying the cd , which i found a used copy in the used bins at my favorite record store . the delerium song & quot ; love & quot ; was nothing i have ever heard before from my favorite ambient act . faithless ' zoe johnston lends her stunning vocals to the beautiful song . i also loved kirsty hawkshaw 's & quot ; fine day [ frakker mix ] & quot ; . i remember hearing samples of that song on an old orbital song . of course what is a nettwerk compilation without a sarah mclachlan track ? to be honest , i actually enjoyed the william orbit mix of & quot ; black & quot ; . i am nowhere tired of that song as i am with delerium 's & quot ; silence & quot ; . i was n't too wild about the telepopmusik or fischerspooner tracks . both groups i find vastly overrated . i loved ihb 's & quot ; olivia newton christ & quot ; and fc kahuna 's & quot ; north pole transmission & quot ; . hooligan 's & quot ; hear me now & quot ; and new order 's & quot ; your silent face & quot ; . with all its imperfections , & quot ; chillout <NUM> & quot ; is quite good but it is n't the ultimate chill out as the title say . i leave that title to my favorite chill out compilation & quot ; buddha bar v & quot ;
i am assuming if you are reading this , i do n't really have to say anything technical about mozart or these great late string quartets . i am only writing this review to let you know ... for anyone who is disappointed with the performance and sound quality of the berg quartet 's emi mozart collection of these same quartets , this is a horse of a different color . recorded in the early 90s for teldec before the berg 's signed with emi , these performances are sublime . you would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid emi records . this is the bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made mozart 's string quartets sound this good . perfect intonation , tone , blend , dynamics and yes , passion . i 've had many collections of these works and this leads the field . by far . this one has it all .... and the teldec sound stage is the cleanest and crystal clear you 'll ever hear . with wonderful front to back depth and air around every note . demonstration sound with great imaging and transparency . you can `` literally '' step inside this recording . well you know what i mean . it really does n't get any better than this
jack white has done it again ! this is my second white stripes cd ( first being elephant ) and it does not disappoint . jack white still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals . this album seems more mature in a way but at the same time , you know it 's the white stripes from the opening riff and when jack 's vocals come in . red rain , white moon , and blue orchid shows that jack white loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles . my favorites , though , are blue orchid , my doorbell , and i 'm lonely ( but i ai n't that lonely yet ) . i think i still like elephant better but one thing is for certain - the white stripes are n't fading away anytime soon . i love his led zeppelin/nirvana style voice and ca n't wait to hear his new band , the raconteurs
i 've read almost all of danielle steel 's books and i do n't think i 've ever bought one brand new . i usually get them at half price books for $ 2- $ <NUM> . this one caught my eye at the store when it first came out and after reading the summary in the back cover , i bought it . its a quick read , i got through it in only a few days . its a more diverse storyline than she 's presented in the past , but the ending just was n't believable . most of steel 's books end with a `` happy ending '' and although most of us want that , sometimes it just does n't make sense . the `` meat and potatoes '' of this book revolves around the tragedy that befalls a once-wealthy family . the introduction of the 'bad guys ' , the buildup of the plot , the execution and then finally the resolution . it seems that with <NUM> pages to go , steel wants to toss in a romance . does n't work ! she does n't build the romance at all , not in a believable way anyway . it seems one minute she 's talking about a cop who 's been with his wife for <NUM> years and `` he 'll never leave her '' and the next thing you know ... a week later he 's in love with someone else ! did n't like the ending , does n't make sense . this book could have taken about another <NUM> pages to draw that out , and that 's something we did n't need . wait for it in the bargain bin
in the tradition of the meters , galactic is presently putting out some incredible tunes . i listen to this whole cd and their other probably at least once a week , all the way through . i cant get enough . they are all extremely talented . you have to buy this cd to understand what i am talking about . it is not a boring cd at all . i recommend it even more if you like the meters . check it out
this book was my first exposure to the barbary pirates and that era of american foreign policy . it is a terrifically interesting period of american history . america , the young nation dealing with foreign policy issues in north africa where local muslim powers are capturing ships and demanding ransom . the bashaw of tripoli and his history with the politics of that region in the early 1800s is rendered more relevant given current events . it is a truly human read with the strengths and weaknesses of those portrayed exposed . this is not sugar coated american history , be advised .
even if you 're not a physist you will love this book
i ca n't stop dancin to this ! it 's the best ever i ca n't help it well i 'm to busy dancin and maybe u will <NUM>
i thought the movie was exceptional . it speaks of human tragedy- the tragedy that occurs on a daily basis- the sadness of everyday life and the small victories that we experience- however small . it speaks of regret- yet as is spoken , you ca n't change what has already happened -- -- nor , can you take it back . i thought it was honest and the performance that ryan gosling gives is true and sad . i give this movie <NUM> stars because of the profoundness and the sadness of this movie . all of the characters are flawed and expertly portrayed and most definately worth the time ..... enjoy
i love every kind of music and i recently was introduced to tom waits . my faviorte genre is metal but i cant stop listening to this guy . his voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful . pasties and a g-string ( at the two o'clock club ) and step right up are my faviorte on this cd . i own a few other cds by waits and i have yet to hear this guy make a bad song
higly recommend to read with your toddler-absolutely wonderful illustrations ! what a cute story ! ! ! !
brad pitt and angelina jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations . pitt and jolie star as john and jane smith . both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage . jane works with computers , while john works as an architect with his friend eddie ( vince vaughn ) . they have dinner each night at <NUM> pm , and neither has much to say . they live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors . but in reality , there is much more than meets the eye . unbeknownst to each other , both are cooly lethal , highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations . they are both assigned the same target , benjamin danz ( adam brody ) . both john and jane show up at the intercept point , but in reality , benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both john and jane . the organizations have found out that the two are married , and there are orders to kill both of them . jane soon discovers that john was the one who foiled her attempt to get benjamin , now she has set her sights on taking out her husband . what happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive . will john manage to escape from his wife ? will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle ? will john and jane join forces to save each other ? i thought this was a very good movie . the story is very well-conceived . there are lots of action scenes , along with guns , knives , explosives , and narrow escapes . there 's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building . brad pitt and angelina jolie are perfect together , and the film will keep you on your toes throughout . i highly recommend this action-packed movie . this movie gives new meaning to `` till death do us part '' .
i love the idea of this book , the story behind it , and the wisdom it contains . with a great mix of inspiration and nuts-and-bolts information , the book covers a multitude of topics , and gives the reader room to expand on her own ideas . this would make a great graduation present , new-phase-in-life present , or a `` big '' birthday present for someone who has put her `` try-it '' days behind her .
great book ! we had the <NUM> edition for my 7-year-old son last year and he could n't wait to get his hands on the new <NUM> . he takes it to school for free reading time and all of the kids love it . even our friend 's 12-year-old says it 's very popular among that age group as well . it 's great because it has something for everyone , is educational , and the sections can be read in short sittings . the cover is almost worn out because he takes it everywhere . we now give this book as gifts all the time
hypnotic , dreamy but not as laid back as the 12th installment ... but the series is more mature these days on applying more on the acoustic side rather than the electronic effect
here 's yet another film i saw as a young lad . but this is n't just any western comedy ... it 's got that special something that only comes around ever now and then . terance hill does a great job as trinity . for instance in the opening scene trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans , which he puts away quite quick ... i read on his website that he starved himself for <NUM> hours in order to do that scene . this is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy . i would also recommend trinity 's third film `` my name is nobody '' which stars henry fonda . anyway ... if you like good western fun then i would say buy this dvd and enjoy
a fine picture about life in a small texas town . easily a classic if they would give the added footage back to the directo
considering i just saw cars , i was n't so sure about over the hedge . i mean , cars actually became one of my favorites after i finished it ! but i gave this a shot and i 'm glad i did . i 'll admit , the whole concept of r.j. using the others to repay a debt was n't very original , but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable . now i 'm debating whether or not i want to buy it . i 'd say rent it first , but if you have kids , this is a good one for your collection
veteran rocker joe grushecky is back with a new cd , entitled a good life . in an age where there 's possible instant fame with tv shows and slick videos , grushecky did it the old fashioned way : grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years . starting <NUM> years ago with his band , the iron city houserockers , grushecky 's always been part working class hero & part philosopher . it 's a combination that has held up over time and this new cd is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo . gary borress , ny
this book is my masters thesis . i built a multi layered combative system driven wholly by neural networks evolved using genetic algorithms . the learning of agents was unsupervised and they existed collaboratively and adversarily . if all of this made no sense , dont worry ! read this book and it will . the book covers these techniques ( except for multi layered architectures ) to a level understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of c++ . it totally demystifies nns and gas . other books on these subjects actually put you off the entire concepts of ai by feeding you fear and confusion . i have completed the book and have read it numerous times . it is going to be invaluable for my development of phd stuff - his writing introduces areas for potential research . im would definately buy other books from this author . i hope he covers other areas of ai soon and puts 'em into print . be jaysus , tis mighty i tell ya ! !
how many times have you fallen asleep and dreamt you were in the fantasy world created by your favorite author ? i 've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in andre norton 's witch world . this author kept me turning the pages , not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero , simon tregarth gets himself into , but also for glimpses of a strange new , magical landscape . she does n't pile on the adjectives , either . her prose is remarkably clean . just read the lead sentence of `` witch world , '' which introduces us to ex-soldier , simon tregarth : `` the rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street , washing soot from city walls , the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall , thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings , watching the mouths of doorways , the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness . '' he is a hunted man , unjustly cashiered from the u.s. army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket . since simon had been labeled as a crook , he figured he might as well play the game . after seven years in the underworld , surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death , simon treats himself to a decent last meal ( andre norton heroes and heroines never whine . they assess the odds , then keep on slogging ) . enter the mysterious doctor petronius who persuades simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies ' gunsights through the siege perilous , a cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds . simon leaves the restaurant with petronius , almost positive that he is walking into a trap . instead of the bullet he is expecting , our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world . the action does n't let up . the first thing simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters ( we do n't learn the witch 's name until the very end of the book ) . the next thing he knows , he 's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing . simon allies himself with `` a tall , proud-walking race with ... the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them . '' his new home , medieval estcarp is a matriarchate , ruled by witches , whose powers depend on their continuing virginity . nevertheless , simon falls in love with the witch he rescued . the enemies that he and estcarp must confront have invaded witch world via a gate similar to the siege perilous . the alien kolder are technically advanced , with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers . estcarp 's only allies are the sulcarmen , seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of gorm to the kolder . simon , his friend koris of gorm , the witch he rescued from the hounds of alizon , and a youthful soldier called 'briant ' tread the mysterious byways of estcarp and its warring neighbors , in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens . lifetime grand master of fantasy , andre norton built well . there are <NUM> witch world ( ww ) fantasies , and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on march <NUM> , <NUM> . many of the later ww novels were collaborations , and it would n't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the grand master created . i wish them well , but so far they have not managed to penetrate the brilliantly weird landscapes of andre norton 's imagination .
exasperation with our son 's behavior led to the purchase of this book . he 's now <NUM> 1/2 . he is high energy in most everything he does . he 's more energetic , more intense , more inquisitive , more dramatic . the older he gets , the `` more '' he has become . this book helped us understand that there are many other kids just like ours , that `` more '' is not bad ( like his prek teacher had us thinking ) and that parenting a spirited child requires a different set of skills . the author does n't give any one sure-fire way to help with the daily struggles you face with a spirited child , but she does direct you and help you to understand . without this book , we may have never understood what spirit is in a child
breakenridge gives numerous , solid tips that any pr practitioner should have at his or her disposal . this is a useful primer
i 'm not going to say too much other than ... wow ... what a fabulous album - this is one that you can jut belt out anywhere - i love it
now this is very good . a cd set with some of the best post-punk material to come out of liverpool and manchester . there is unfortunately some great overlap with the martin hannett story cd but this set is overall more satisfying since it is more varied and also contains more stuff as well as a few rarities that everybody will appreciate . indeed , in additioon to buzzcocks , the fall and new order , which were obvious choices there are also some old favourites like ludus , crispy ambulance and big in japan that merit to be heard . if you are interested in thie very special period in british music history then this is an essential acquisition .
how can one write a review of the story of san michele that comes close to doing justice to the book ? there are many humorous episodes , such as the giant and mamsell agata , touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in naples , misadventures , like the journey to sweden accompanying a young man ( then his corpse ) . there are also angry moments , as when his dog tom is brutally kicked by the slimy vicomte maurice . who could not be moved by the story of the boy john , who was rescued by munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home . it is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed . many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films , given the right adaptation . the story of san michele is very well written , to say the least , and the many people , events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure . perhaps most special of all is axel munthe 's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close , even to `` wild '' animals and have a special relationship with them . he was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death . i have had a copy since <NUM> and i have given axel munthe 's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction . i could not recommend this book highly enough .
i was n't sure what i would think of this movie , but i found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-soviet russian life . it showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself . the movie was also an interesting discussion on morality . danila was not a bad guy , though he did fit into the criminal world well . he still did what he could for those who had nothing . it was , at times , hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man . the movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two danilas . there was also the family dynamic ; his brother was willing to put danila 's life in danger . desperate times call for desperate measures . overall , the movie was entertaining . it was heavy , but with a few lighter spots so the viewer does n't get overwhelmed .
this dvd is a reworking of a tv series from the mid-90s that was released on vhs as `` jacques pepin 's cooking techniques '' . unfortunately , not everything from the original series has been included on the dvd . as stated by other reviewers the presentation format in the dvd is also combersome , with most segments lasting less than five minutes and then returning to the menu . it would have made a much better product and been less disjointed if they just released on dvd the original series as originally made . also the dvd features a couple of segements from jacques ' early 90s series `` today 's gourmet '' . it would be great if kqed would release these on dvd also . nevertheless , the dvd does present the basic and most common techniques used in the kitchen , and is useful for anyone who wants to improve their skills as a cook .
i saw `` annie get your gun '' again this weekend live on stage . i had forgotten just how many great songs irving berlin wrote for this masterpiece ! -- '' you ca n't get a man with a gun '' , `` the girl that i marry '' , `` doin ' what comes naturally , '' `` anything you can do i can do better , '' `` they say falling in love is wonderful , '' `` i got the sun in the morning and the moon at night , '' and the classic anthem `` there 's no business like show business . `` if you have n't seen or heard this musical , please do yourself a favor and get this film on tape or dvd . afterthoughts : i just read several negative reviews about betty hutton 's portrayal of annie oakley . do not believe them . do not even read them ! some people are `` the glass is half empty '' type of people and negativity is contagious ! betty hutton 's portrayal was , of course , probably directed by the director of the film . so it is `` the director 's portrayal '' ; the director is responsible for what betty hutton did on screen . and , this is not meant to be a `` realistic '' portrayal of a `` real '' person anyway -- -no one alive remembers what annie oakley was really like . so the portrayal by betty hutton ( as directed by her director ) is as good a `` shot at it '' as any other -- -including judy garland 's portrayal . so , i suggest you just accept betty huttons portrayal as `` one among many possible '' and enjoy what the portrayal does have -- -alot of comedic verve and vivacity ! yes , `` the glass is half full '' .. and even more than half .... in this case . and then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because annie pretends to be a poorer shot than frank near the end to `` get her man '' by letting him win and thus showing his `` shooting prowess '' some respect to make him feel better . i suppose for some people it is `` politically incorrect '' to `` play the male ego game '' . but , is n't `` playing the male ego game '' what it takes sometimes to `` get the man you want ? '' so , was n't annie in the play just being `` realistic '' ? is n't criticizing this aspect of the play `` nit-picking '' . ask yourself , could you even come close to writing a `` masterpiece '' like the musical , `` annie get your gun '' ? if you could n't do it , then what gives you the right to `` nit pic '' the show ? and the indian issue . some people feel indians were disrespected in the show . but , the show i saw has chief sitting bull portrayed as giving good advice to annie and being an intelligent person . in my opinion , whichever way the indians were portrayed in the movie does n't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show . my suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and enjoy the show ! and there 's alot to enjoy ! : o ) email boland7214 @ aol.c
by page <NUM> , i was hooked , by page <NUM> , i was ready to write tha author a letter of thanks . this is not a `` how to be a military wife '' book ! if you want to learn how to read an les , go somewhere else . but , if you want to put the modern military wife into a historical context and see how , sadly , little has changed since the 1940s guides , this is an amazing book . the author starts with a woman who has lost her navy seal husband , and the casualty notification system . then she moves into stories of living on post/base , long deployments , the expectations put on spouses and their behavior , the economics of military life , domestic abuse , ptsd and the struggle for any form of `` outsider '' or person who may not share the views of the majority in the military . this book was a welcome breath of fresh air for any military spouse who gets frustrated with the limitations that a military career can often cause for the `` dependent '' . the stories of women are interwoven with research and statistics effortlessly . again , this is ... well , it is an anthropological study of what it is like to be a woman married to an active duty military member in this day and age , with frequent deployments to the middle east , with the political atmosphere in the us being what it is , and the struggle that comes between the three ends of the triangle described in the book . we 're supposed to step aside and let uncle sam come first in our marriages ... but at what cost ? i think every commander and nco should have this as required reading before they schedule their first frg meeting .
every now and then we sould honor the memory of morse and john thaw . inspector lewis does that plus it brings some closure to the other key character . so the author of this screen play is no colin dexter and reverted to remaking hamlet - at least it is admitted in the dialog itself . very predictable plot twists and well crafted ending . all in all , <NUM> stars if you 're into morse . skip it if you are n't
... and they caused me to pass it up for about <NUM> years , too . i do n't recall many kind words about this movie when originally released . most reviewers never got past the notorious scene -- you know the one i mean . how sad . anyway , i took their word for it , movie sucks , do n't waste your time . they were so wrong . i finally saw it this weekend . wow . what an outstanding little thriller . and , i got ta say , a fairly important film . along with jacob 's ladder , this seems to anticipate almost every major thriller of the past <NUM> years . but this one came first , and it may be the stronger film . rourke is terrific . seeing this , it 's hard not to wonder how different his career might have gone if the critics had n't chosen to make him their personal whipping boy . i 'm not quite ready now to rush out and snag copies of 91/2 weeks and wild orchid , but i 'm thinking about it . they were so wrong about this one ... maybe these others were n't celluloid vomit , either . anyway , excellent film . if you 're a horror / thriller / mystery fan , and have steered away from this one because you did n't want to see the cosby kid defiled , i 'd encourage you to give it a chance . and if as it unfolds you 're thinking , man , this is pretentious trash ... well , hang in there . when the story is over you might feel differently . only complaint . deniro 's character 's name . come on . as effective as the movie was , it might have been that much more so if they had n't telegraphed deniro 's character every step of the way
i really liked this movie and felt it was well done with much suspense and action . it was like i was part of the whole movie . it brought back for me a feeling like it could really happen . it was true to ny and the people . the action and acting was really good . i enjoyed the movie and felt its a winner .
since i have been married i have fallen in love with my crock-pot ! we both work and it is just the most wonderful thing to come home in the evening and already have dinner ready to go . sometimes it just does n't seem worth the effort to cook for just the two of us , but the crock pot always makes it just so easy . using my crock-pot has saved us so much money by not eating out , and the ingredients that this book calls for are very inexpensive for the most part . it is also much healthier than eating out several nights a week . the best part of this book is that you can always find a recipe that sounds great and you have all the stuff that you need for it in the house . really , all it takes is five minutes in the morning to throw it all in the crock-pot and then you have a great dinner ! i almost always just put the meat in there straight from the freezer and just add an hour or so of cooking time . this would be a great gift for a shower or housewarming . overall , it is a very simple book that always produces tasty and healthy dinners
i have n't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there 's online piracy ? but i have to own this . feinstein 's voice is so pure and versatile ; he is funny at a moment and the next , he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet . his performance is first class , and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert .
hey guys , i think this is the best cd i ever hear.and the songs are sooooo cool ! oh , and i love michael's-voice , he is so cute ! :
to compose a book set in a particular nation when you yourself belongs to a different country , it 's forever going to be an issue of debate on whether your interptretation of the culture is authentic or not . then again , your own comprehension of the nation is put under a cloud . and reliability of your understanding is a major factor . thus a novel which transcends the national boundaries and cultural restrictions is always a rare item of literature in an equally scantily elemented realm of art but pearl sydenssstricker buck 's pulitzer prize winning book `` the good earth '' set against the backdrop of a china for which the 20th . century revolution were distant rumblings of the dim future . this is a timeless , evergreen classic dressed in a transparent , empathic language and a finely woven plot which conspire to guise this dark story in a lighter hue . wang lung is a mediocre farmer ploughing his life through difficult times in kiangsu and around him `` the good earth '' revolves . pearl s. buck might be an american but in her adroit tracing of the trajectory of wang lung 's life across a vast sky of deceitful times in china , the reader fathoms the mark of a gifted writer who has come to spearhead american literature . the authoress etches a great picture of wang lung and the plethora of incidents which provide testimony to him being led on by life 's waves . wang lung marries a slave from the house of hwangs , o-lan , and along with her undergoes umpteen adventures and misadventures in life and witnesses its numerous dimensions . ove a period spanning a lifetime , wang lung and o-lan travel to and fro the dual extermities of knee-deep poverty and exotic richness and therein eflect changes in character . the farmer and his wife along with their three sons and two daughters suffer abject povety when their village is cursed by drought and famine in such a degree that they 're reduced to consuming even their ox . in search of better prospects , the protagonist takes his family to town where beggary is the sole mean to make both ends meet . in anhwei , wang lung confronts bleak situations and finds himself nothing short of a foreigner in his own country , amidst his compatiots . lung fathoms a thick delineation between the rich and the poor and finds his own rustic background a crippling factor for him to blend with the townsfolks . this is a plight that is not only shared by other villagemen who 've taken compatible measures as lung to earn their living in the town but also by uncountable such uneducated masses around the world in all ages who flock to a different landscape in hunt for better scope and in this symbolism abodes the book 's universal appeal . wang lung 's adventures in town get him enough money and when he returns to his home village , he 's already a prospering man . he buys land and cultivates myriad crops on them and gradually steps up the ladder of success and ultimately reaches the pinnacle when he and his large and everbranching family start residing in the house of hwang , the symbol of traditional landlords . but his monetary success comes at the cost of his moral notions as wang lung 's conscience , despite sustaining honesty throughout , gets absorbed in preposterous wealthy , aristrocatic fashions . lung emains unwary of his selfless , dedicated , devoted but ugly wife , '' a woman such as it is not commonly found '' , o-lan and keeps mistress and is so absurdly misled by illusions and fakes . the reader deciphers in lung a man of basic and simple foundations , at times queerly naive , tainted by misapprehensions . `` the good earth '' may be the moving tale of chinese farmer wang lung and his wife o-lan but this is not by any purpose singular or mundane in nature . pearl s. buck mirrors an essentially conservative and reserved chinese society in this her prize winning novel but , all the same , hypocratic and deeply soaked in grotesque traditionalism . the disgraceful customs of slave trade and perception of a wife as `` a faithful servant '' are a couple of features highlighted by the authoress which reverberate even today in several culturs . `` have you not heard it said that in the sacred edicts it is commanded that man is never to correct an elder ? '' the stucture of the plot has a certain symmetry about it and follows a more traditional yrt consolidatory paradigm occasioned with ghastly images of poverty , self-denial and self-improvement . but for all the exemplars pearl s. buck 's book launches , it 's not without its fair share of dewfects . a number of flaws is given the go-ahead in as early as the seventh page when the authoress remarks about `` silver dollars '' in wang lung 's village . this is a technical blunder as dollar was not a common item there then . again , the authoress is shrunk and limited in her descrioptions of a harrowing picture where sge could 've been more elaborate : '' then o-lan crept out and she took a great iron knife she had in the kitchen and she cut a grat gash in the beast 's neck , and thus she served its life . and she took a bowl and caught its blood to cook for them to eat in a pudding , and she skinned and hacked to pieces the great carcass ..... '' . this restrained sentimentality and employment of economy of words take the sting out of the tail really . even so , these blemishes do n't overshadow at all the forcce and sensibility of the book . the mazing facet about pearl s. buck is the conviction in her language bordering on a gentle assurance of an unique tale . `` the good earth '' is an immensely haunting pre-revolutionary china novel and is extensively ambitious . the writer merges familial and social lives and interlaces them with echoes of the past , regular rhythm of the present and disturbing notions of the future . `` but there was no peace '' is a catchphrase rippled throughout the book in various overtones , be it in wang lung 's father 's placidity , in his own distress , in the distant hints of a revolution or in the first signs of christian infiltration in china . in lung 's craze for land , the reader would observe fragments of count leo tolstoy 's short story `` how much land does a man need ? '' and the disguised inevitable end . pearl s. buck 's `` the good earth '' is a riveting read , a book that borrows its classic proportions from the well-drawn characters , ranging from the honest lung to the selfless o-lan , the cunning whore lotus to the deceiving first lung son , perfectly coalesced into a social setting that is forever promising to be on the shift .
this book presents the <NUM> and <NUM> posture tai chi form . the <NUM> move form is good for busy people , but the <NUM> move form is even better because it combines movements from the <NUM> most popular styles of tai chi , yang , wu , and chen , so the student gets some background in each . at <NUM> pages long in large paperback format , this book packs a lot of info between the covers . for example , i learned that in addition to the wu style , there is also a w ' u style , which i did n't know , although i 've studied both yang and wu style tai chi . the author gives a brief introduction to tai chi in the first chapter , discussing basic concepts and information , then proceeds to some classical taoist philosophy . he also tells some interesting stories about the founder and his sons , who had many adventures and exploits , and various stories and legends have grown up around them . next there is a separate chapter on chi gung , a subject that has become almost a requirement for a tai chi book , i notice . however , most of the book is taken up by athe chapter showing the martial applications and the <NUM> move form . dozens of applications are shown , and the photos are clear and easy to understand . i found this the most enjoyable part of the book , as there are still postures i do n't know all applications for , such as snake creeps down , and the author presented one on that . there is a chapter on guidelines for tai chi practice that gives detailed instructions for how to use the different parts of the body , from the eyes to the feet in performing the form . i found this useful because sometimes i still forget some of the fine details of how to hold the body when i do the form . finally , there are several appendices which provide a list of the <NUM> and <NUM> postures and their translations , a glossary on chinese terms that is more complete than most , and a brief bibliography for further reading . the book is well written and easy to understand even when discussing some of the more abstract and esoteric principles . there are two mini-biographies of each other , two prefaces by two different masters , and a preface by the notable dr. yang jwing ming
this book is a wonderfully informative and touching story of a great and honorable man . through totch we learn of a nearly forgotten way of life and we see the everglades as it used to be . i appreciate his honesty and plainspokeness and i 'm thankful totch made this book to preserve an important history . i also recommend the three movies made about him : totch brown 's tales of the everglades and 10,000 islands , the everglades outlaw totch brown , and yesterday 's everglades
this is the guitarist from jonah 's ( yeah , yeah , yeah ; jonah 's this , jonah 's that ) former band far . this is a really good footing for the radio in it 's current state . i have a question though : when the heck is that quicksand tribute album supposed to come out ? ! k ; bug the heck out of this band if you ever see them and ask them about the quicksand tribute album that was supposed to come out like <NUM> years ago ( it was also supposed to have ray cappo from youth of today and shelter , chaka malik from burn and orange 9mm , glassjaw , biohazard and a bunch of other incredibly talented people ) . ta ta
i love doris kearns goodwin 's work , and this book is no exception . it 's very different from her other books , but very enjoyable . it brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers . very short in comparison to her other books , but worth the time and the money . i have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong , but i am not a baseball historian , so this did n't bother me in the least bit .
when i was born in <NUM> , my mother , a german armed forces helper on the way from prague ( deep south ) up to an isle named `` ruegen '' ( in the very north ) , in the middle of her long journey through a breaking down germany : she came down with me and , after one day in hospital , she stuffed me away into a children 's home ( in a town called `` wuppertal '' , west-germany ) - and left me to my fate . so she robbed me ( among others ) the experience of a childhood in the gdr , german democratic republic , `` wuppertal '' should be `` west-germany '' ( american sector ) , the isle of ruegen became russian sector , behind the `` iron curtain '' . so i did not learn anything about `` young pioneer meetings '' , socialism , communism , stasi ( the secret police ) or summer camps of young `` pioneers '' . in the western hemisphere i grew up , drinking pepsi coke , receiving american care packages , later on : listened to the beatles , noticed the students movement in <NUM> , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out the place , where the woman could live , who had born me in that dark year <NUM> . after <NUM> years of persistent search , <NUM> , before the berlin wall fell ( <NUM> ) , i found out : she was living behind the `` iron curtain '' on the isle of ruegen . and i started to look at this lost childhood , which i did not enjoy : she showed me her photo album : summer beach near `` kap arkona '' at the north-point of the isle , snowy winters on hiddensee , flight ducks , cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks . color films ( orwo ) , books , trabi substitute parts : only hard to get . nevertheless , i wanted to make up for my life in the gdr - in <NUM> when the berlin wall was fallen : a schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor , filled with former stasi employees ( security police ) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb `` cadre conversation '' , he unfortunately ( thanks to the `` reunification '' of east and west-germany ) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now ( in hastiest kind ) . i should return please to west-germany , where i just had come from . the direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically , out of character , and not recommendable . no `` ossi '' ( vs. `` wessi '' ) - no job . as a result my mother , noticing , that all her dreams collapsed , joined an acute epidemic disease at that time : she committed a so-called balance sheets suicide . i was deprived of the chance to become a `` zone child '' a second time . did i miss really much ? because the book of jana hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic `` ossi '' writings ( of course very different to my `` wessi '' -point of view ) are not as superficial , simple , banal , as i thought in the first moment ? compare her point of view ..
excellent performances by chet baker . his voice is unique and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers . it is so rare to find so many songs by chet baker in one collection and here are some wonderful songsby a wonderful jaxx singer and player
with over <NUM> recipes , this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it 's paces , but i 've had great results with the few dishes i 've tried so far . the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked , with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion . i 'd use that on any sandwich , anytime . the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette ( really a sambal vinaigrette ) and wasabi cream were awesome . veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners . granted , i have n't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good ! i picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe ! what a deal
it 's dark . it will make you cringe . the things that the main character , jill , says and does - well no person who is right in the head does or says things like that ! and it 's some of the most freakin ' brilliant comedy i 've ever seen . love it
andrew solomon is a science writer who has taken the risky step of telling the vast , intriguing story of a deeply personal condition in the first person - which means that we follow him on an extraordinary roller coaster ride toward self discovery and healing ( solomon suffers very serious depression and tries all manner of `` cures '' including a death-wish desire to contract aids , and bizarre tribal rites in africa ) while also tracing the long tortuous history ( and geography ) of depression as a subject . our understanding of depression , solomon lucidly reveals , has been the subject of a centuries-long tug of war between two mindsets : those who see it as a chemical condition , and those who see it as a psychological ( ie emotional ) condition . as the history of civilisation veers between rational and romantic eras , so too has the understanding and treatment of depression . is it any wonder that a modern sufferer is torn between the talk-therapies and the chemical therapies such as prozac ? andrew solomon comes down with an argument that both therapies are flipsides of the same whole - and that both have a role to play as sufferers seek escape from the bottomless black abyss . on the way he covers related subjects including depression and suicide and depression and creativity - and , this is the miracle of his writing and a tribute to his approach - the subject matter comes over as fascinating rather than gruelling . if you are a sufferer , or live with one - or simply wish to know better how the human mind really works , this volume is pretty compelling . one of the best pieces of advice that andrew solomon cites is from a greek philosopher who , more than <NUM> years ago suggested that sufferers enjoy good wine and food , and surround themselves with good friends . a humane and enormously rich piece of science writing
diva destruction is another band that i just had to check out without having to listening to their music . i was intrigued by what i have read about them on metropolis record 's website . it also helped that they are signed to my favorite record label so i had some inkling to what the band sounded like ... somewhat . i bought the cd last thursday and since then i have been listening to the cd non-stop ... the in your face production from scott humphrey and frank gryner knocked me off my feet . i have n't heard such clean production as what i just heard on `` exposing the sickness '' . debra fogarty 's vocals ( w/back up vocals from sharon blackstone ) reminded me a lot of siouxsie sioux and tina and susan from switchblade symphony . very powerful . debra could put a lot of today 's singers to shame . the bass , drums , guitars , and programming blended well , a mixture of rock and industrial music . as i am listening to `` exposing the sickness '' again , diva destruction reminds me a lot like their fellow labelmates clan of xymox and bella morte but with female lead singer , especially bella morte but with more programming and less guitars . i loved `` exposing the sickness '' right from the get go with the first track `` heathcliff '' . my favorite songs off this album has to be the remix to `` when trees would dance '' ( as well as the original version ) , `` tempter '' , `` valley of the scars '' , and `` hypocrite '' . i definitely plan on acquiring their first album as well as future releases from the band in the near future
if you grew up as a davy crockett fan in the <NUM> 's , this is it , the real thing ! you 'll want t o get out your coonskin hat and wear it for the movie
i was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually . i have a high end harmon kardon system so that is not why . i cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough . my wife is p'od since she does n't know how to manually start these two songs .
after `` l'assommoir '' and `` nana , '' i was accustomed to zola 's `` naturalist '' style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about second empire society . but `` germinal '' surpasses those two , mainly due to zola 's efficiency . middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading ( no search engines or video games in the late 19th century ) , so it 's understandable why `` germinal '' is so saturated with detail . that being noted , this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading . zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator , the movements of an enraged crowd , the gossiping wives of miners , etc. , giving the reader a clear description of the sights , sounds and smells of the moment . a few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism . while much of symbolism ( the mine that eats the workers , the sufferings of catherine and so on ) could give that impression , this is story of disasterous ideology . set in 1866-1867 , when the civil war in the u.s. exacerbated the coal industry 's overcapitalization in france , etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement ( instead of catherine ) and sets off catastrophe . the episode in which etienne , chaval and catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners . there are a number of very interesting characters in this book , who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things . sprinkled with references to darwin , `` germinal '' features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior . whether zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable , but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved . the change to the timbering rules by the company , the charge by the miners to jean-bart , and the act of sabotage by the souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences . and it has been unintended consequences that defeated marxism . in this way zola was prophetic . chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that etienne constantly battles . a very good website by a professor at washington state mentioned that `` chaval '' resembles `` cheval , '' which means `` horse . '' so the practicality , beast-of-the-mines existence of chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story . in this way chaval is a fully-developed character in `` germinal . '' does this book have contemporary interpretations ? during the week that i read this , there were two newspaper stories about coal mining . one in the weekend milwaukee paper , told of a labor shortage in american coal mines , where in pennsylvania and ohio , veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave . soon afterward , the n.y. times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central henan province of china , showing a picture of thin , grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine , waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing . given the ( capitalist ) history of the u.s. and the ( communist ) history of china , would zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in <NUM> ? coal mining in the u.s. , of course , is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove ; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election . zola 's `` germinal '' is a masterpiece ( i enjoyed the translation by leonard tanock ) , but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope .
wow ..... sam popat must have been hurt a lot in life , because his selection of music is so personal and painful , yet exquisite and beautiful .... thank you , thank you sam for once again breathing life back in to this collection , this is so much like the first three releases of the series , and if i daresay ... tops them ! if you want music that is intimate personal and you can chill to , do not pass this up
it is great to see the old show 's being brought back to dvd . i really enjoyed watching this dvd and season <NUM> . keep bringing the old show 's back on dvd
wow ! now people without cable can see some episodes of spongebob squarepants ! this dvd contains some popular episodes , such as `` texas '' with the song `` i want to wake up in texas '' , and the episode , `` f.u.n . '' with the fun song . the dvd also has the episode , `` the graveyard shift '' which would have been good for the next dvd , `` halloween .
a exquisite exotic , as terrible in beauty , and sweet in dreamworlds as any penned since poe , very much it 's shadow . vance weaves a world as bejeweled in color and fantastique as readers could imagine , in a earth perched at the end of time , while the sun sputters its last gasp . magic rules , and poor cugel , its hero wanders from the lilac-flavoured poisons of mazirian 's garden to the autumn-cut glass palaces of the dying earth . he is betrayed , bewitched , and perplexed by his environs , all to our joy , and such is his adventures that we hope for more , but it takes a genius such as vance to realize it . some say night lamp is his last , but his readers , his children , will reimagine the lost lands of this book long after he is gone , perhaps to the end of this incredible , dream-haunted journey
obviously includes all the `` a '' list sites but everything else . if you get bored , do n't blame this book .
marc anthony sings with so much love and passion that it 's hard to stop listening once you play this cd . i really like his music a lot . every word is meaningful and intuned with such deep feelings . the way he sings about love makes me want to fall in love . this is another great album of his
this is a pretty good comp , but it could be a lot better . for one the sellouts ( bosstones ) should n't be on it . a lot of good bands from the warped tour were left out , and this was meant to capture the essence of the tour . it did n't
why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line , i praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between hemmingway and agnes . all correspondence was done through letters between them after hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters hemmingway wrote angus since a later boyfriend of angus destroyed all of hemmingway 's letters in a jealous rage . if there was in final face to face meeting , both their lives may have very different . more than likely the two would have continued far different lives together . hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to , or a european whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages hemmingway went through . although a bit contrived from reality ; the story line does make an impact emotionally . in my opinion though sir richard attenborough should have had his lead actors at least read a farewell to arms before attempting their roles . it might have helped out with acting that was a little flat and emotionless at times like they did n't have enough material on the original characters and were trying to ad lib . still it 's very much worthwhile watching this sometimes fictional account of a young hemmingway and his first and lost love
a wonderful movie about a boy whose family are coal miners in ireland . this young boy wants to dance instead of following him father and brother into the coal mines . he rises above the ridicule of him family and friends and finds a mentor who helps him fulfill his dreams . what i love so much about this story is that one realizes you do n't have to follow the norm in order to be happy and succeed . what we need to do is follow our hearts . i loved this movie and i believe you will too
okay , first i need to respond to a previous reviewer who gave this cd one star and stated ... `` she loves you~ twilight singers is the kind of music that i detest . it is wordy and pretentious and sounds like the lyrics are written to annoy rather then for the audience to enjoy . '' `` she loves you '' , as clearly stated by most of the reviews here and amazon 's description of this cd , is an album of cover tunes . meaning , all songs writen by other people . so your complaining about the verbosity of greg dulli in a review for this cd is ... well ... dumb . upon investigation into your previous reviews i noticed you gave <NUM> stars to a nick cave cd which is surprising because nick can be pretty verbose and often times pretentious . bottom line , if you are here to talk trash about somebody at least listen to the cd first and be honest about it . that being said ... greg dulli shows some pretty serious ambition with his choice of covers on `` she loves you '' including the oddball `` hyperballad '' , the billie holiday classic `` strange fruit '' , and fleetwood mac 's `` what makes you think you 're the one '' . onlike most cover albums , dulli does n't just pay lip service to the originals , he applies his unique soulfull paintbrush to each and makes them his own . most cover cds are bad ... this one is n't . it 's really , really good . buy it .
this cd is incredible . i love their style and the vocals are superb ! i will continue to purchase more of their music .
leisa hart is by far the best steel instructor , i have always loved her style and consider her my own personal trainer when using her videos . she is charming and genuine , a real woman . i love her new videos like gym in a box and the core series and ca n't wait for her sexy series . she is a great teacher and can help anyone , even witha ten yr old video
patricia mcconnell has written a wonderful book filled with engaging stories and much practical advice for dog owners . she incorporates the latest research findings on the workings of the dog 's mind in presenting her own cases from her behavior counseling service . her discussion of counterconditioning covers an extremely valuable concept that is not stressed ( or even utilized ) enough by other behaviorists and trainers . this technique is invaluable and of nearly limitless potential in alleviating many emotional distresses and disorders in dogs . especially pleasing to see is that in her discussion of counterconditioning and other techniques the author diverges from the decades-old approach of addressing `` behavior problems '' ( a term that should be killed off and unceremoniously buried - it 's not the animal 's problem any more than if your husband had a habit of talking too loudly to your liking would you tell your friends that he had a behavior problem ) by focusing on simply eliminating the behavior . this mechanistic behaviorism approach may be effective in eliminating the behavior but frequently does nothing to relieve the dog 's underlying emotional distress that is causing the behavior . for example , if a dog is suffering from loneliness because he is tied up alone in a backyard and barks endlessly for human attention and companionship there are plenty of ways to eliminate the barking . but there is only one correct one : alleviate the emotional pain of loneliness . mcconnell understands this and focuses on this underlying emotional distress when working with the dogs to change unwanted behavior . in light of the advances in neuroscience , comparative psychology , and brain imaging , this places mcconnell on the leading edge of the changes underway in how unwanted behavior in dogs should be addressed . the primary focus in treating behavior `` problems '' is to help the dog rather than the owner . mcconnell gets this . most dog behaviorists and trainers do n't . i strongly recommend this book for all dog owners who want their dogs to get the best emotional care and support in all behavior-related matters .
there is nothing more basic for weight and blood sugar management than the food exchanges . they are called exchanges because the foods in each group can be exchanged with each other and still supply a similar amount of calories , proteins , carbohydrates , fats and other nutrients . `` the official pocket guide to dieabetic exchanges '' is an excellent resource for describing the nature and benefits of the exchanges . i have been a diabetic since the age of <NUM> . it is certainly easier to use the exchange system then laboriously counting calories and carbohydrates . they give us a short hand method of coming up with close approximations . one thing that can also be of benefit to diabetics is the glycemic index which measures the impact of various carbohydrates on our blood sugar level . glucose is given a value of <NUM> . all other foods are ranked according to the percentage rise they cause as compared to glucose . for example , apple juice has a glycemic index of <NUM> . this means that a serving of apple juice containing <NUM> grams of carbohydrates would cause a blood sugar rise that is <NUM> percent of that which would be caused by <NUM> grams of pure glucose . related to the glycemic index is the glycemic load which applied the glycemic index to serving sizes . to calculate the glycemic load the grams of carbohydrates ( less the fiber ) is multiplied by the glycemic index expressed as a percentage . an exchange of apple juice has <NUM> grams of carbohydrates . multiplying this by <NUM> % ( glycemic index of <NUM> ) yields a glycemic load of <NUM> . now lets compare this to <NUM> gm of watermelon . watermelon has a glycemic index of <NUM> which is higher than table sugar . the glycemic load of watermelon is <NUM> ( <NUM> x .72 = <NUM> ) . thus the impact of watermelon on our blood sugar is almost twice for the same level of carbohydrates . fortunately , a half of watermelon only has six grams of carbohydrates as compared to a half cup of apple juice which has <NUM> . measured on a volume basis the apple juice actually has a higher glycemic impact . no such luck with a baked potato which has a glycemic index of <NUM> . a half cup of baked potatoes has <NUM> grams of carbohydrate . this yields a glycemic load of <NUM> ( <NUM> x .95 = <NUM> ) . determining the glycemic impact of foods does require more effort than just counting exchanges . but by getting involved in the details i have been able to lose nearly <NUM> pounds and am able to manage my blood sugar levels with diet and exercise . this has certainly been a worthwhile effort for me . i am sure that it would be for others . good eating

it could be . i have a pretty extensive collection of slack key cds , and this is my favorite . without it , i may have never heard ozzie kotani or moses kahumoku . it 's beautifully recorded , the liner notes are well written , plus they give all the tunings
my son saw my copy of `` yes , your teen is crazy '' ( which was an excellent book by the same author . ) i thought this book would be geared more towards teens -- as i planned on giving it to my son to read -- to understand why parents act the way they do . however , it was not written for a teenager . it was very similar to the `` ... teen is crazy '' book .
it seems , as time goes on , henley just gets better . with the eagles he came up with 'the last resort ' possibly one of the prettiest use of chord sequences about and powerful words to accompany them . then solo with classics 'the end of the innocence ' and 'new york minute ' and now with what i regard the best two tracks on this album 'goodbye to a river ' and 'damn it rose ' . the latter trying to convey the suicide of a close friend . what you hear is what you get with henley . he has to be the finest vocalist 'live ' i 've encountered . as for his songwriting let me put it this way , i 'd put him up next to roger waters with the way his songs always manage to move me . shame they left the two best songs form the album off the dvd . splendid work mr henley . time to take another eleven year break it was worth the wait
i 've watched this <NUM> times in the past month by sharing it with everybody . even my country/western fan son loved it
i agree with the previous reviewer , cool jazz ? john lewis and milt jackson defined cool jazz . much better than that crap now that i call `` smoove jazz '' . this cd evokes memories of the music inn and tanglewood in the 50s . the namesake of this cd is the song django , a tribute to the late great django reinhardt . this is a must for any jazz enthusiasts collection
dana andrews is excellent as the captain of a downed army air corps b25 bomber over japan . these us flyers are captured and put on trial in a civilian court in front of the international press for suppossed & quot ; crimes against humanity & quot ; . the japanese secretly torture the airmen one by one trying to discover if they came from a land base or a carrier . the story basically revolves around whether or not the american airmen will tell the japanese what they want to know . the final minutes of the film are quite stirring . the film music master , alfred newman did the score for the film and cleverly chose not to use very much underscoring music until the final scene in the film . although the music he uses is borrowed and not original his adaptation of it is powerful
just in case the preceeding reviews do n't settle the question , i 'll add my unqualified rave to the list . the subject matter of this film is important for many reasons and is equally full of dramatic potential - this movie makes the most of both . the screenplay is constructed like a beethoven symphony - logical , constantly moving forward , boiling with energy . the script , presumably , is based on the original transcript of the conference . the acting - well - how can one praise it enough ? the human drama - the constant interplay of personal politics , intellectual fencing , bestial attitudes and genuine emotional reactions to the subject matter being discussed - it 's captivating from first to last . and the last scenes are superbly poignant - the final intimate focus on both heydrich and eichmann as shallow men and profound monsters , the use of schubert ( as both reference and musical score ) to underline the moral desolation and irony at hand , the final roll call to enumerate the sober injustice of the participants ' ultimate fate . this is yet another hbo movie which raises the bar for american cinema , proving that one can still make a great statment on film without either large budgets or avant garde methods . i can watch this over and over and always get something new out of the experience - which , of course , is the very best recommendation for actually purchasing a movie on dvd . buy it and watch it often
this is an excellent live concert , volume one of two , originally aired on pbs ... this concert contains <NUM> plus hits , and many musical clips of your favorite stars from the fifties era ... it was very important , to get these great artists , on stage to help keep the music alive ... many of the artists are slowly passing in time ... it is very important for people from future generations , be , able to hear this wonderful music ... from any generation , whatever music you like today may sound weird or dated to future generations .... everything played today will be tomorows oldies ... i love and own both albums from pbs .. this set makes an excellent gift . <NUM> star rated ... i thank you stewart l
i have been `` making '' my kids listen to the music of tmbg for years , but i no longer have to `` make '' them listen . my <NUM> and 7-year-olds actually `` want '' to listen to songs like `` no ! , '' `` clap your hands , '' and `` four of two . '' although this is not tmbg 's best cd ( some say it is `` flood '' ) , this is my kid 's favorite tmbg 's cd
& quot ; monkey business & quot ; looks pretty good on dvd <NUM> years later . the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought , a bit darkly tinted , and more defined . the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout . marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here . she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss does n't like her punctuation . cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance , getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth . his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ! ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth . if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions , it 'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings . hugh marlowe as the straight-laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game . oscar winner charles coburn ( <NUM> , the more the merrier ) does a great job of appreciating monroe 's assets as oliver oxly , the ceo . kathleen freeman as mrs. brannigan gives a fine performance . the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films . this is a great little piece of cinematic history . turn back the clock & amp ; enjoy
as i am a scholar and an expert of na-dene groupings , i find this to be one of the most fascinating and remarkable volumes of the handbookd of north american indians . the photos and linguistic data are absolutely fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating ! i have recently been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of this book- that many of the northern 'athapaskan ' tribes are not totally 'mongoloid ' , as i had previoiusly surmised . i have discovered indian ( from 'india ' ) and turkish strains that are especially , concentrated in northeastern british columbia and northwestern-northwest territory bands . these findings have shed much light on my na-dene origin theories , regarding the genetic makeup of the na-dene forbears . awesome ! !
i really enjoyed this book . kendra marty falls in love and wants to spend time with this young man , but she also feels the need to help her grandfather . the decision she makes reveals a lot about her character , caring and unselfish . a great christian novel that i would recommend to anyone
the great 18th century mystic swedenborg , who claimed prolonged visions of heaven and hell , reported that souls in hell do n't know they 're in hell because they 're behaving as they did in life ; the angels , however , look upon them and see them as terrible beasts . as i watched this profoundly engrossing film , i had no doubt by its end that it 's not just an artistic & quot ; turn & quot ; dealing with hitler 's psyche , image , and horrific legacy but instead is a powerful portrayal of him in hell . hell for hitler may well be eternal self-absorption and facile self-analysis punctuated by the rare inkling of consequences of his acts and awareness of the reality of others -- sporadic insights that reduce him to befuddled torment and ( his worst nightmare ) weakness . the actors ' portral of hitler and goebbels are brilliant , and the film itself left me shaken . it seemed not so much an artifice as a true vision of hell
where i come from high school sports in general was something merely for the jocks to participate in and rarely garnered any widespread interest within the school . football games -- except for the annual `` bowl '' game against our cross-town rival ( eventually discontinued because of the traditional post-game brawl ) -- rarely found more than one hundred parents and students attending . so some of the meaning behind this film is i guess lost , leaving me more of a dispassionate observer than anything else . still , i really found this movie to be quite fascinating , and a powerful and well-told story .
i 'm giving this dvd four stars because the sound is good ; it 's excellent . i 'll overlook the fact there are times he 's singing , but the microphone ai n't quite there . it 's obvious marilyn manson puts on one hell of a show . this dvd is rockin ' , in that sense . just remember , teeenie boppers , it 's theatrics . alice cooper , iggy pop and others , in the late sixties and seventies , did this sh -- . manson ai n't nothin ' new . it ai n't like satananic theatrics are scary anymore . this dvd borders on a three star rating . it 's just that he does put on one hell of a show . marilyn just is n't all that and a bag of chips . his theatrics are good , but it 's hard to take a man , in a thong like s & m type outfit , seriously . oh , when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous . i 'm sorry . smellin ' his butt with his fingers just gets comical . i still give it the four stars because i like his music , and this dvd sounds good . the editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song . sure it 's well done , but it ticks me off when bands do this . bad religion did it ; but , my lord , how much money does this band have and they release this kind of dvd ? it annoys me . i probably should give this dvd three stars , but it does rock . you just have to get over the fact marilyn looks like an idiot . he lacks that toughness to pull off the look , if that 's possible . if he walked into a bar lookin ' like he did with the thong leather pantie crap , a woman would kick his butt ... you can reference a guns 'n ' roses review of mine , i believe even axyl rose , in his cute little shorts , could kick marilyn 's butt ... i know that was n't politically correct , but it 's true ... screw it , i should give it three stars , but the show is flippin ' fun ..
this is my fav for guitar instrumentals.what i love about beck is that he is about tone and not about speed.most people think the faster your solos are the better , not true at all.beck has amazing melody and tone and is very technical and his leads and solos are amazing.a great album by my favorite guitarist . beck is very underated.he can play as good as any of the greats.he buries clapton , page.i would say hendrix and beck are the <NUM> best guitar players.both have great tone and similar styles
the movie is awesome , but the cd is equally amazing . awe-inspiring , from quiet , peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end , this is one of the best soundtracks ever written ! a great gift to yourself or friends
if anyone wants to know what living in post-revolution iran is like for a woman , this is the book . great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state . the scariest thing , for me , is how closely the vision of iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the u.s. held by christian extremists . this touched me with reality the way the handmaid 's tale by margaret atwood touched me with fictional possibility . i have to say that i felt undereducated where her literary criticisms came in
given that no special effects were used and that the film took two years to complete .... the aerial combat sequences are fantastic . the plot-lines are trivial , but universal . i think that the horrors of a seemingly endless war in europe are well presented . this quite an enjoyable film , particularly if you are conversant with howard hughs dedication to get it made
if i think of a cyclops , there is only one that comes to mind ( i know there were two in this movie ) . it is the cyclops in the 7th voyage of sinbad . if i think of a fire breathing dragon , it is from this great movie i see the definative dragon ! ray harryhausen has created so many incredible creatures it is amazing that there are some people out there that just do n't know what they are missing . the golden voyage of sinbad is another classic included in this set . the least of the three movies included in this set is sinbad and the eye of the tiger , it is a good installment showing what a master craftsmen harryhausen had become ! the dvd set has great transfers and some nice extras . this is essential harryhausen .
lucille ball 's second tv show `` the lucy show '' does n't seem to come close to her first , the extremely popular `` i love lucy '' , in amount of reruns syndicated on television . this is a shame since the quality of the two shows are very similar . in the series , lucy stars as lucy carmichael , a zany secretary working in a hollywood bank for her stodgy boss , mr. mooney . lucy 's less-than-efficient secretarial skills and wacky hijacks frequently infuriate her boss , but somehow she is loyal to him not matter what . the five episodes included in this dvd feature some famous guest stars including carol burnette ( playing lucy 's librarian roommate carol ) , and john wayne , milton berle , ruta lee , and george burns . like in `` i love lucy '' , lucille 's character fawning over the movie stars is very amusing and even though the series was made a decade after `` i love lucy '' , she still does much of her physical comedy pretty well . the picture quality of the episodes is not the best and the menu navigation for the dvd is somewhat confusing , but those problems are not bad enough to distract from the shows . while its not quite as good as lucy 's first show , it 's still a great show and worth a look if you enjoy `` i love lucy '' or lucille ball
this was one of those impromptu buys . had n't ever heard of her before , just liked the clips and said , `` why not ? '' there is n't a single bad song on here , so how often does that happen ? she 's a screamer for sure , but it 's still melodic and not too downtrodden . her range of styles is impressive , too . not too many screamers can do the ballads so well : -
joss stone channels the best in soul and blues with unbelievable vocal maturity and performance skill for her age . if she can keep herself healthy , we 're in for many years of joyful listening
this book is an excellent general biography of a great martial artist . it covers his life before and after bruce lee , touches on his progress since lee 's death and has some very interesting interviews and quotes . the book is a fine tribute to a humble , talented person and instructor
this is an amazing book , practically one of a kind ! the information , illustions , and luster of the indigenous african cultures is beautiful to behold . i recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation , life . there is nothing so intricate , so inveloping and powerful as life in this form . pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading , which is , in fact , very enjoyable
at last ! one film with no fearfull scenes - ( to be entertained doesnt mean someone needs to be frightened .. ) no nightmares , ... ! at last no unnecessary stupid killing . innocent just like a kids heart . beautifull images original imagination , .... inspiring ! so artistic ... all that critic others wrote , just has to do with technical stuff . kids dont see a film criticizing it - they watch it with their feeling , and this film is full of love , piece , honesty and respect , hurt and loss .. about feelings . so natural .... not overplayed ! . i dont want steril films that just keep my eye busy .. and i really dont think this film is in any way threatening to democratic beleifs ... ! ! ! i would say it gives kids the sense of authority ... like their parents authority . i liked that the bad charakters werent over-the-top bad - they were just like people in reality are . they werent unnaturaly `` absolute '' bad guys and good guys . kids need to learn these things . that there arent just bad guys and just good guys . they need to see that good guys can do bad things and bad guys arent always totally bad guys but can be good also .. i loved dinotopia and am gratefull that i had a chance to see it . will see the other movies with dinotopia too ..
i am a big leann rimes fan and i have every cd that she has out . i think this is an awsome cd . everyone should go out and get it .
i took my best friend to see this ( second run ) in an small , artsy theatre in san francisco . it was so vivid and colorful ... very interesting to watch . i found myself following the storyline without having to focus solely on the subtitles . as a result , i could appreciate the landscapes , the costumes , the hidden innuendos ... all the first time around . this movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship . there is a scene near the end when the uppity , seemingly prudish momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend , ichigo that made us want to cheer . as the end credits rolled , the small audience broke into applause . afterwards , we raved incessantly about how much we collectively loved it
i had to respond to a comment made previously ; `` another standout moment is her duet with peter cincotti on neil sedaka 's `` breaking up is hard to do . '' cincotti is clearly the superior singer here ; he does piano here as well . '' cincotti does have a very nice voice , and when he begins the song one is immediately impresses with his voice . unfortunately , renee then chimes in and like a cat dancing with a pig , she trounces his vocals . he simply is out classed by this little girl ! like sinatra , cincotti has a nice voice , but he seems even more limited than sinatra in his range . sinatra was a fantastic singer , but he know what he could or could not sing , and concotti is likewise challenged . in contrast , renee seems capable to singing anything ever written with the style of the greats such as ella , and lena horn while also having the strength of voice of say ronstadt , and streisand . she may not be quite opra ready yet , but i did say may not , as she darn well may be ready . at this age perhaps charlotte church had a stronger voice , but she certainly lacked the nuance which is needed for jazz , and which young renee has in abundance . i good friend of mine who worked closely with bands like huey lewis and the news , earl scruggs , etc . quickly picked up on her youth when he heard her sing , most would not i suppose , but he was stunned at her ability . the cd is not perfect , there are flaws , but as a package it is one heck of a musical ride this little girl takes you on ! last year i was hearing stories about her next cd out of hollywood , but so far nothing . i just hope she stays with jazz as i think it is the only formate where she can really demonstrate the full extent of her enormous vocal talent . i am very anxiously awaiting her next cd
as a lifelong cat lover , i normally would not have glanced at this book , but my nephew , now a jr. in high school , has chosen architecture as his career . that , plus his love of dogs , caused me to have a look at the contents of this book as a possible fun gift for him . glad i did ! the imagination , the styling , the artistry , and of course , the love that obviously went into the creation of this book , proved to be a great gift choice for my nephew . even if there area no canines sharing your life , this would be a great coffee-table book to keep on display for friends and guests to enjoy
it is not always wise to revisit old loves , because nostalgia can be treacherous . but not this time . as an adolescent in the 60s , i , like many of my peers , fell in love with dusty springfield . forty years later , i listened to this collection , and i am in love with her all over again , only more so . her voice was very special . from the country-style folk of the springfields , through the romantic standards , to soulful r & b , she could do it all , and all exquisitely . there are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that i missed first time round . listen to the unique phrasing on the son of a preacher man , a song that she made her own , and the delicious seductiveness of breakfast in bed ( which i heard for the first time on this cd ) and you will see what i mean . her life had tragedy in it . in many ways , the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the british tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that dusty was a lesbian . this helped destroy her uk career and after that she spent most of her time in the us and the netherlands . by nature insecure , she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt . just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with the pet shop boys and an appearance on the jools holland tv show ( what a hero that man is ; when are we going to have his show highlights on dvd ? ) she was diagnosed with breast cancer , which ultimately killed her . among the divas of twentieth century british popular music , she is supreme , and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the us also . it was good to hear the look of love on the catch me if you can soundtrack . it will help keep her voice alive for a new generation . that track is on this cd and is just one gem among many . they repay close listening .
bought this cd when i was in australia and i fell in love with it from the first time i listend to it . a mix that will blow your mind , mos has done it again - a record worth every cent . get it , you wont be disappointed
a wonderful story of devotion ! mem fox continues to be one of my favorite children 's story tellers . hunwick is a sweet little creature who remains loyal in spite of others ' misgivings . the use of so many animals strange to the americas makes the book even more wonderful , with delightful pictures to help with the story
this book is phenomenally crafted , written with heart and sincerity . i can not recommend it strongly enough . i learned about it through the recent new york times `` top fifty '' recommended list , which included several authors i 'd never heard of . frankly i was concerned that the list would have a couple of weak entries as happens . `` independence day '' reaffirms my faith in reviews , polls , awards ( pulizer ) and i 'm glad to know that this is just the second installment of an iconic series . to say the language `` independence day '' is poetic is an understatement . ford exercises control over both the vernacular and the estoric ( on average i did n't know a word every five pages , but that 's a good thing - the language is rich and sincere as is the engrossing narrative ) . the word `` angstrom '' appears in the book , perhaps a footnote to updike , who knows ? frank 's sale to the markhams is one of those protracted dramas , no , comedies , that weaves through like a wagner liefmotif . wait , that simile strikes the wrong key , because the markhams , as you get to know them , and you will , in richly parenthetical passages , represent everything you the reader and frank dislike about pure unadulterated dumbasses . ok , i can go on and on about this book , it 's subtleties , it 's heartwrenching passages about love and divorce , but no , go read it
i recently discovered this author and went out of my way to find the other books in this series . good book
i really loved this ! it inspired me to love the nutcracker alot . i like the voices in it , especially phyllis diller 's voice on the mouse queen . i really wish they could 've released this on dvd . it 's such a great movie
this book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong , complex characters , and the history of a legendary part of the united states being just two of them . the world through the main character 's eyes is a world seen anew . the reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century brooklyn , the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together . i would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story .
these films stand on their own as great films and great examples of demille 's unique brand of film making . they do n't need 'extra features ' to hype them . i was also glad to see the inclusion of 'four frightened people ' which is quite different from demille 's usual epic style . the packaging of the set is actually quite good , with single-sided disks and an attractive slip case . the film quality is excellent , considering the fact that these films are over <NUM> years old . overall , an outstanding collection at a relatively reasonable price .

awb is a very underrated band . their talent is definitely for the mature r & b fan who enjoys funk . if this description fits you , you will love pickin ' up the pieces . there were more great songs on the cd than i expected . `` cloudy '' and `` a love of your own '' were the slow jams when i was in high school . i am so glad to now have this cd in my collection .
if you would like to know how life was on a german submarine in ww2 , then this is the movie for you . it will keep you glued to your seat . i would recommend this movie to anyone who 's interested in ww2 history and how the thoughts of german sailor 's were not much different then our own .
<NUM> % recomend to learn about spy histor
an electric autobahn towards the infinite ... be carefull , this is veeeeeeery trippy stuff ..
bewitched is one of the best shows ever . forty years later their still fun to watch . each ep . is funny and well written . samantha marries the mortal darren and promises to give up her magic to the endless dismay of her mother the wonderful endora but luckily somehow samantha ends up using magic . aunt clara pops in often and creates her own chaos with her mix-up spells . every single ep . is my favorite .
the corpse bride did n't quite captivate me like the nightmare before cristmas did , but even so it was an imaginative and entertaining claymation film with great animation and interesting character designs . the movie 's dark use of colors creates the feeling of a black and white film . the story sparkles with witty puns , for instance , we hear the bride say : `` that just takes my breath away ... or it would if i had any breath ! '' this is a cleverly written , beautifully animated film that should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of eight .
it 's been <NUM> years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much has n't . a quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that love and death could ever co-exist . now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce . see this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable
in hindsight i should havt to watched this before foxey brown , as this was a better movie . however , it seems that foxey was more memorable , with it 's over the top violence . this one 's is pretty violent . and pam grier is more naked in `` coffy '' than `` foxey brown '' . coffy offing a drug pusher in the first few minutes , having a touching family moments , fighting a room full of women that results in everyone 's top being janked off , some bad guys nuts getting blown off . pam traded blows with at least <NUM> lesbians at once .
another good movie with rupert everett ... he simply has a good sense of humor that flows naturally in all the characters he portray especially in this movie . cate blanchett is spectacular . i would say , this movie has a very unpredictable and funny , some evil plot but not a boring story at all . my husband and i simply love this movie . he has to thank me over and over again for getting this for his valentine gift
i very rarely buy a soundtrack , especially to a videogame , however this one left me with no choice but to do so . this easily the best videogame music i have ever listened to . i guess one reason behind me buying this is the fact that unlike many psx games , this one you can not listen to as a backwards compatible cd ( all the final fantasies are this way ) and the poor music cd that came with anthologies left me wanting more . no this is well worht purchasing even if you do n't like the game , the music is more than enough to make this worth owning
just a bit less evolved . the songs on this album are absolutely brilliant . with a wide range of styles , there 's something on this album for everyone - only the songs you and i and you 've got it bad girl are anything less than fantastic , in fact . you are the sunshine of my life - very good , original song . not his best , but still good . maybe your baby - an awesome groove , nice synth bass , but maybe it goes on a bit too long . you and i - not a bad ballad , nowhere near as good as blame it on the sun , but has its own charm . tuesday heartbreak - very joyful sounding song . good tension between the verses and chorus , great melodies throughout , and excellent drums . you 've got it bad girl - a bit jazzy experimental . not bad . superstition - good dance tune , very funky , with a powerful horn riff that peter gabriel would later rip off in 'sledgehammer ' . big brother - awesome clavinet tune , angry lyrics , nice melody . blame it on the sun - this is one of the best ballads , written , ever ! really . he does this kind of ballad on every album , but this is the best of them , with a soaring ( or wailing ) verse that slides into an emotional chorus . lookin ' for another pure love - very original music , freestyle melody . i believe ( when i fall in love it will be forever ) - this is a real triumph , this is everything a song should be , with an awesome chorus that repeats <NUM> times at the end and you 're not getting tired of it .
i used this book as a primary preparation tool for the sun certified business component developer ( scbcd ) exam . being a beginner in ejb , i found this book to be very friendly . i liked the layout of the book in general and the writing style of the author in particular . only relevant pieces of code are presented to focus explanation of topic in question . a complete running application may be downloaded from the author 's website . the multiple choice questions at the end of every chapter and alerts in every chapter made remembering main points easier . deployment descriptor elements are clarified in considerable detail and they are explained well . please note that there are errors in this book - some of them are fairly obvious such as using a capital letter as opposed to a small letter ( java versus java ) while others are not so obvious but noticeable by experienced java developers . regardless of its minor faults , i consider this book to be a valuable addition to my library . normally i would have a cut a star for the errors but because of its content quality , i felt compelled to give <NUM> stars . i just passed the exam today thanks to this book . i know that i will not hesitate to buy another book from this author . thanks mr.sanghera ! i recommend this book highly without any reservations whatsoever
i read some of the reviews before i purchased it . i agree that the dvd was not made with high tech , the toys used were not even new at all , the instructors making weird sounds ( to me ) . i was disappointed at first and planned to sell it right away . but i thought i should give a try to my son , <NUM> months . surprisingly , it catches my <NUM> month boy full attention ( he would not pay attention at all to baby bumblebee ) . he watches for over <NUM> weeks , he started to copy the sounds and gestures they made in the dvd . sometimes , he will even make the sounds before the instructor does . though , he still only says mama , but i am already so happy with the current result .
love the movie , love the soundtrack ... it lags a bit during the instrumental pieces , but the bowie tracks more than make up for it
this is a cute btb dvd that has not only the regulars ( bob , wendy , spud , and the crew ) but many of the other favorite characters including farmer pickles , mr. beasley , and that tea making mrs. potts . there is also scruffty the dog , and some adorable mice and bunnies ! in the first story , `` scruffty 's big dig '' , scruffty the dog manages to fall into a bunny hole and get stuck . muck passes by and gets spooked by scruffty 's howling , but it all works out in the end when bob and the crew solve the mystery and save scruffty . the second story , `` bob 's boots '' , has bob breaking in new boots . the boots squeak and attract mice , which as we all know lofty does not like . lofty ends up running for home , followed by bob , followed by the mice -- which bob does n't realize are there . bob thinks lofty is imagining that there are mice . all of this in interweaved with a sub-plot wherein spud takes bob 's lunch by accident . the mice end up chasing spud because he gave them some crumbs . in the third story , `` mr. beasley 's do-it-yourself disaster '' , bob is hired to build a garden shed , while wendy is busy painting mrs. pott 's fence . chaos ensues when bob gets diverted from the shed work to do a quick roof repair for mr. dixon . bob and wendy keep missing one another ; and mr. beasley begins the project himself , working under the misguided notion that he can use tools . wendy shows up to wonder what is wrong with bob that the structure looks so crooked . she repairs it and it 's actually pretty funny when bob and mr. beasley actually think mr. b did the work . the fourth story , `` spud lends a hand '' , is about the installation of a sprinkler system for farmer pickles . everything goes fine until spud 'lends a hand ' and advises the crew on how to finish the installation of a rain-tank . chaos results when spud ends up giving advice to the lofty and the guys . the tank breaks loose and not only rolls down hill , but destroys wendy 's gift which is a sailboat . bob ends up saving the day when he takes the remains of wendy 's sail boat and turns it into a motor boat . the final story is `` dizzy 's crazy paving '' . it 's my favorite because it has wendy in a 'if you have lemons , make lemonade ' kind of situation . mrs. pott 's wants a new sidewalk and everything starts out fine until too much fooling around leaves the square pavers that they were going to use , broken up . wendy solves the problem by making a sort of crazy quilt sidewalk with the colorful tiles . the stories are linked by the mischief , humor , and creativity . five stars ( for a bob the builder dvd ) . five classic bob stories on this one . my son loves this dvd and can watch it over and over . sometimes he will focus on what bob is doing , and other times the equipment , and yet other times the little animals that in the stories : bunnies , dog , cat , bird , mice . great fair for rainy days
to be sure raw music is the best but this album is a sweet mix of voice and technology .. and always makes me cry especially `` my heart my love '' .. nusrat had a great gift from the big boss upstairs .. miss him very much
it 's very hard for me to be objective about these two recordings by lou rawls and onzy matthews . i wore out my vinyl long , long ago and have been waiting for the cd issue of these records for <NUM> years . finally ! great and creative big band writing by onzy matthews .... the arrangements never get in lou 's way and such mature singing for a young guy . lou 's in great voice , the selection of material is first rate and the writing and playing top notch . enough with the cliches ........ buy it .. at two for the price of one
throw all the luna albums together on ipod , hit random , and any of their songs that fill one cd are a best of . i could n't stand them until i shut up and listened two years ago
this book struck me as unique on several levels . first of all it is a serious , thorough examination of the 21st century mafia and stock scams , through the eys of a serial swindler working for the mob . but what really appealed to me about this book was its writing style , which was unique among the mob books i 've read in being offbeat and satirical . it is very unusual to read either a mob or a business book , and this book falls in both categories , that approaches its subject in that manner . you practically have to go back to jimmy breslin , and his gang that could n't shoot straight , to find a less reverential view of the mob . the difference is that breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story . in business , the only parallel is michael lewis ' liar 's poker , which of course delved into an entirely different side of wall street
i had never watched mr. show up until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on tbs slightly edited . i was hooked and began recording every episode on tivo , until i realized they seemed to be edited so i picked up the 4th season and loved it , there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing , my favorite being the story of everest . i finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times , and while i found myself laughing out loud often , i did n't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season , aside from one or <NUM> sketches , not too much really stick out like the majority of season four . a must own if you 're a true fan of the show , for the commentary alone
this is a great dvd for any fan . the middle of the show sometimes seems slow , but the 10+ minute version of vitamin is worth the price alone . the extra cd that comes with the dvd is also good for anyone who doesnt have some of the songs in their collection already . `` follow '' is a great song and hopefully their new cd this summer will have more songs like it
ok , the title gets <NUM> stars . i have n't had the priviledge of reading it yet myself . gave this as a gift . the recipient praised the author and was eager to begin reading it .
i see wynton marsalis mesmerized , james brown befuddled , aretha astounded , mariah mortified , beyonce blushing , eric clapton clapping , and pelham goodard ( peegee ) gasping . ahhh yes ! the seven-layer salad of song ( jazz-funk-soul-pop-r & b-rock-calypso ) ... the magic johnson of music . my fav ... ttd 's recurring dream . i luv the metaphysical stories , jimi hendrix-like wa-wa guitar sound , and that cowbell sounding percussion . mad props to we do n't have ... great calypso , holding on to you , supermodel sandwich w/cheese ... so , so funky , as well as all the others . it 's too bad many slept on this work of art . but many slept on ray charles until just recently . although the album title does n't indicate what the song or album is about , nevertheless , it is less than flattering . no other complaints though . definitely an album for the thinking person and introspective . i genuflect out of courtesy and respect .
lucio fulcis zombi <NUM> is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made [ dawn of the dead is a close second ] and should be in every horror fans collection . people say that its a rip off of romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead . romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture is actually quite original . the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective . the zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies are rotting , decaying monsters . each one has its own original qualities . the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing . it takes like <NUM> minutes for the film to get going , but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking of gore , zombi <NUM> has plenty of it . the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly .
donna jo napoli 's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in `` the magic circle , '' her retelling of `` hansel and gretel '' . napoli 's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales , reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters ; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable . such is certainly the case in `` the magic circle '' , in which she explores the background of hansel and gretel 's wicked witch . the hunchback woman is known as the ugly one by all her neighbours , but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval europe community . she is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called asa , and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage . but her friend bala has other ideas , getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that ugly one may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to bala of course . ugly one is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms , knowing the danger is extremely great , but as a devout christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with bala 's wishes - surely god will aid her , and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons ' tricks . after cleansing a little boy from a demon 's influence , ugly one knows that she has found her new calling in life . but once several years pass , her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever , she is careless with the protective magic circle . what follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers . bartering with the demons for her daughter 's life , ugly one manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest . in napoli 's book the term ` witch ' is used in the traditional christian sense , not the new age one , so be prepared for a negative usage of the word ( personally i found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days ! ) however , it 's not so black and white , for though ugly one can no longer shed tears , bleed or sleep , has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children , she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses . living in isolation , she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home ... napoli 's story is poignant and thought-provoking , as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil , the will of god and the strength of the individual against temptation . like all her other books , her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of `` hansel and gretel '' forever . although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning bala is raised only to be ignored , `` the magic circle '' is an intriguing little book . the demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real biblical and occult study ( so you 'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale ! ) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day . though it is not my favourite napoli novel ( that would have to be `` zel '' and `` spinners '' ) , `` the magic circle '' is a great little read .
i 'm somewhat of an history buff , especially wwii , but when my mom bought me this book at a yard sale , i did n't know what i was in store for upon reading it . there are lots of little known facts about hitler 's secrets and his personal life . we get a glimpse inside of hitler 's head to see what makes him tick - it was n't just his hatred of the jews that drove him . the book was just a conglomeration of interesting information , and contains many rare photos . if you like reading about hitler or similar topics , this book is worth buying
the cd arrived in good condition and i got it within a couple of days
simply fantastic ! anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this . some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children .
i was visiting russia this summer , staying with the grandparents of one of my friends . there was one shelf of books in english in the room where i stayed , and the mind parasites was one of them - i read it in one day , i could not put it down ! it was just an amazing book ! and since no one who lives in the home where i stayed speaks or reads english , i could have easily just brought the book home with me , but i thought & quot ; oh no , i 'll just buy my own copy when i get home. & quot ; now i 'm kicking myself , hard . i had no idea the book would be out of print and hard to find ! the copy i read was nice , too . whoever owned it took good care of their books . i 'm seriously thinking of writing to a friend over there and asking him to go over to the house i stayed in , and get the book so he can send it to me
all the reviews i have read of the ppl cd 's have had to do with the two leaders of the band , and while they are both great singer/songwriters . i think the real fun in listening to these songs is trying to spot that high , sweet , soft background vocal , and some of that shimmering guitar sound . it is none other than vince gill , you know , the artist to have won a grammy for every year in the decade of the <NUM> 's , the man to have quietly lived out one of the most succseful music career 's in a long time . i just find a lot of enjoyment in imagining a young <NUM> year old vince gill finding his way in his new music career . he 's married to amy grant you know , huh & quot ; amie & quot ; ... amy . if that 's not fate i dont know what is . good songwriting , check it out
this dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world , and work , of john santerineross , known as the leader in this genre , of art photography , he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books , `` fruit of the secret god '' , and `` dream '' , he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces , and a short art film about a shocking subject ( cutting ) , done very tenderly , so as not to shock . this little film , in spite of breath taking visuals , is not so much eye candy , as it is mind candy , leaving a hauntingly , bittersweet , after taste on the tongue . the images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements , presented through a dream like filter . the sepia tone photography , evokes the feeling of , a memory , a strange familiarity , regarding our desires and fears . his work is a wild roller coaster ride , which , thrills , and at times , terrifies , and leaves you wanting to `` go again '' . the images of women portrayed in this work , are a refreshing respite from the mainstream images of women that , we are bombarded with daily in the media . like real women , each image begs to be studied for content . the film itself is not long but is filled with so much information , so much to process , it is an epic in its own right . i highly recommend any of john santerineross 's work , to lovers of neo- symbolist , art , photography , and erotica . to other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration .
one of the best of original old school , i wish more of today , s music had the same demeaner as a lot of the eighties music , because a lot of todays music have the same sound . give me old school anyday
this was an excellent documentary . i had never heard of this film , until i viewed it during a class . a must see ..
i bought this book after seeing another book by raab at a friends house . i bought a copy for our home so that my then teenagers could have a simple easy to use cookbook . it has good basic food that appeals to teens and young adults . it tells how to stock a pantry , tools you will need and other helpful hints about keeping your kitchen clean and operating kitchen appliances . it even has soup recipes , pizza , meatballs , hummus , cookies and many more yummy recipes . i was going to send this to my son who is away from home for two years serving a church mission but , i could n't bear to part with it so i sent him his own copy . another great book by raab is `` the clueless vegetarian '' well worth the price ! ! ! a
absolutely hilarious . i wish i could get amnesia just so i could read it again and be surprised

zoot sims never made a bad album , but he did make a great number that were merely very good . this one , however , is excellent . sims , peterson , and pass all solo beautifully , and the bass and drum team of mraz and tate are behind them every step of the way . the two standout tracks are ' i got rhythm ' , where sims follows an explosive peterson solo with full-throated honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register ; and 'embraceable you ' , when zoot proves that only webster , getz , and hawkins can challenge him for beauty of tone . that said , there is n't a bad track on this cd , and it will give any zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure
although not a document of a working band , this is clearly a record dave douglas wanted to make . following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers , he has drawn together the sympathetic talents of james genus , bill carrothers and billy hart to pay tribute to joni mitchell . hers is music he obviously loves , the reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire . the other music uses joni mitchell 's ear for a great tune as a springboard for dave 's thoughtful , instantly appealing compositions . beautifully recorded , this is a one-off ; do n't miss it
i laughed out loud while i read this book . i was surprised that it is so slim , yet each story is packed with humor . the reader can not help but enjoy the professor 's adventures in the crazy academic world of philology . this is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors do n't complain about the laughter
if you want to hear a little jamaica without going completely native maxi priest is the way to go
this game is great for young computer-users ! each page has at least <NUM> & quot ; interactions & quot ; -- i.e . clicking on the salt shakers in the kitchen makes them dance . the story can read itself to you are you can read it silently . even clicking on one word makes the computer say it . great for children just learning to read . however , using it too many times can get tiring ... after all , it is just a computerized book . great value for the money
protagonist donna trenton sure is in hot water , or should hot weather be more appropriate . as if being trapped in a dead pinto with a sick child in the middle of summer while a mean dog surveys the vehicle is n't enough ... but when the mumbo jumbo beast happens to be inflicted with rage on top of that , you can safely say that , besides being toasted in many ways , this lady definitely should have stayed in bed that faithful morning . but , alas , like in any stephen king novel , one has to pay the price , and since woman adultery is the case here , poor donna has a lot to chew on , to say the least . writing in a alcoholic stupor ( as stated himself ) clearly does n't stop king from delivering an effective read . indeed , cujo is gutso with lots of blood , excitement and canine hair . its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting , but when the gear is shifted , watch out . driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this maine man . cloned perhaps in its `` jaws '' bite , cujo is nonetheless pure king when it comes to compelling plot . just like its saint-bernard creature , the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose . yes , the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is -- enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award , for sure . enjoy. -- -- -martin boucher
charming , delightful , and surprising , it evokes and energizes dim memories and resurrects the full emotional impact of memories still fresh . and levine mit dein flying machine was startling in its evocation of a time when jews were desperate for acceptance , and went to great efforts to memorialize the accomlpishments of jewish americans in song and otherwise , no longer content to remain outside looking in . i bought several cd 's and gave them as gifts , which were big hits with all .

i 've worked out with kathy smith videos for years . i 'm about the same age as her and was delighted when she tackled the subject of the menopause . it is a very postive dvd and it made me feel empowered . i do work out regularly and found the cardio a bit too easy for me but will definately use it on days when i feel a bit tired . i would definately recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers of any age . the workouts are short and therefore easy to fit in when busy .
excellent autobiography that should be required reading ! mr mandela has written thorough life history of himself and of the struggle for freedom and equality in south africa . as long as it was , i just could n't put it down . highly recommended !
i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much . my only experience from the band was clint eastwood and recently feel good , which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.but i recently watched the whole demon days album played at the manchester opera house and ... oh man ! i was totally blown away ! the performance waas amazing , i totally loved the songs , and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too . god ! i wish i could have been there ! i had to buy the cd , love kids with guns , dirty harry , last living souls . even the soft and mellow songs are amazing . i was talking to a friend when i started watching the dvd and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different , away from the ordinary , catch damon albarn this time
jacqueline bisset in a wet t-shirt . five stars . thank you for your time
we had already seen an album with hip hop infleunts on `` diamonds and pearls '' from <NUM> , this album from <NUM> commonly called the symbol or just prince & the power generation is the album where it eventually sounds like a band performing together , and not a semi-solo album like `` diamonds '' . they also go one level further with even more hip hop sound then on any other album . `` my name is prince '' samples his old song `` i wan na be your lover '' among others in the beginning , the song itself is a catchy hip hop infleunted song with both raps and samples . prince also raps here and he 's loud as even before . with lyrics such as `` my name is prince and i am funky , my name is prince the one and only '' it may sound ego-centric but with all the things he 's done and experienced he got the right to . `` sexy m.f '' was a song that the radio did n't want to play cause of it 's explicit lyrics and ( title aswell ) . on mtv is became a massive hit but it was highly censored . it feaurures guitars and classic horns . `` love <NUM> the <NUM> 's '' is a middle paced slow jam , still with hip hop sound though . `` morning papers '' is anothe ballad , but more relaxed . great lyrics like `` if he poured his heart into a glass , and offered it like wine , she could drink and be back in time for the morning papers '' . `` the max '' is a funky hip hopish number where npg show it 's potential . `` blue light '' is a slow paced song with reggae sound somehow . `` eye wan na melt with u '' is also funky explicit song about sex . `` sweet baby '' is the opposite , a very emotional ballad about love . `` continental '' is a up-tempo song with horns where npg once again show what they got . `` damn u '' is a slow trendy ballad . `` arrogance '' is only 1.35 , and sound more like a funny number then anything serious . `` the flow '' is also a funky song that feaurueres horns , pretty typical for this album . `` <NUM> '' was one of the biggest hits from this album , a middle tempo odd number that does't really fit in here . `` all <NUM> and we 'll watch them fall , they stand in the way of love , and we will smoke them all , with an intellect and a savoir-faire '' it 's aparently about a man from the bible that will never grow old . ditto with `` and god created woman '' , a beautiful ballad perfectly suited for a prince album . `` <NUM> chains of gold '' is midtempo mini-opera that goes on for over <NUM> minutes , it 's part soulish falsetto and part guitar solo 's . very unique . `` sacrifice of victor '' is a funky song that portrait prince as a civil rights activist and goes back discussing the riots after martin luther king jr 's death . overall , this album is much more focused then the last one and here most songs are either funky hip hop sounding ot smooth ballds . it does n't feel like a solo album anymore and npg get 's much more space then on any other album . the lyrics are exceptionally on point here and the rock opera on `` <NUM> chains of gold '' is one not to miss . although it was messy there were more natural hit singles in `` diamonds '' though and this `` symbol '' album get 's a little repetitive at times , on the other hand it 's proves that prince was able to melt into the early <NUM> 's hip hop revolution and do it with class . 4/
i would love to discuss the paradoxes in this movie but that would give away too much of the plot for those who have not seen it , which should be the reason your reading this review . any story dealing with time travel will have them , it is unavoidable . think of the `` grandfather paradox '' . if you were to travel back in time and kill your grandfather , you would never exist . if you never existed , you could not travel back in time to kill your grandfather . so for purpose of this movie you must suspend your disbelief . the plot of this movie is brilliantly cohesive , as it can be . it just requires a lot of thinking . this film is beautifully shot , has great acting , and a great story . i definitely recommend this one .
if you have n't read the first book of this series , buy it now.the second book is even better . roarke is even better then before and he has great supporting characters that just make this story leave you wanting more.i buy and read a lot of books from amazon and have many favorite authors that i read but let me tell you , mr. grossman is the man .
`` we live in the flicker . '' need i say any more ? as much meaning as can be packed into just over <NUM> pages . best read in a quiet place with a good bottle of red wine at your side . not for the weak of mind or heart . be prepared to discover .
overall this is a very useful book , largely because of the excellent photographs . be aware , however , that place names are in the conventional form , not pinyin . the book was written in <NUM> ; many excellent chinese cookbooks are more recent and reflect the current market place and field investigations
edith piaf died in <NUM> . her chansons ( = french for 'songs ' ) live on . even stronger than that : the more time passes by , the more one realizes how breathtakingly good they are . though definitely set in the mid-20th century , piaf 's voice , style , timbre ( = french for 'rhytm ' ) and choice of repertoire effortlessly deal with any passage of time . setting does n't matter at all , and the same goes for the limited recording technics of her days . being widely recognized as the 'soul of france ' , piaf carries her chansons to the most extreme corners of planet earth . right up to this day . in europe her 'non , je ne regrette rien ' ( = no , i do n't regret anything ) makes the greatest impact : the 'life goes on'-undertone of this chanson still brings inspiration & courage to millions of her admirers . 'non , je ne regrette rien ' also reflects piaf 's own life : being of very modest origin , she surely had to put up a stiff fight to gain her immortality . she did so by finding her inspiration in a deep & uncompromising love for her native france . as only a limited part of humanity speaks french , piaf 's achievement is all the more impressive . one should realize americans & english always have an easy ride : <NUM> % of the world 's population speaks their language , while the other half adapts to it for reasons of efficiency . no , surely any number of stars is n't enough to reflect on edith piaf 's chansons . their quality takes this mid-20th century chansonniere beyond praise and time .
if you enjoy adventure stories , and look up to those people who meet challenges placed before them ; this is a dvd not to be missed . be sure to watch the `` extra features '' items on the dvd , as they take an incredible story , to even new heights as additional facts about shackleton 's journey are revealed , about this most incredible survivor story of all time . a must watch for the entire family
this is undoubtably the beasties ' best cd . there still great now , but on here they 're more rap/rock , which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop , which is n't a bad thing . most rap nowadays really sucks goats ( * cough * cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall * cough * cough ) . this great disc features such classics as girls , no sleep til ' brooklyn ( the beasties best song ) , rymin and stealin ( which has a rather nice tribute to the clash ) , fight for your right , hold it now hit it , and the infamous brass monkey . if you 're a fan of any rap or rock , i highly reccomend this amazing cd
we certainly live in a time of change . and it seems that even the rate of change is increasing . in this fascinating book , mr. kozak-holland draws comparisons between the problems that churchill faced in assuming leadership of the british government at the start of world war ii and the modern business world . the changes in the military situation facing england were quick and sudden . the changes in the business world only slightly less so . consider , for instance , the marketplace for cameras . in a matter of very few years , the shelves at your local discount store basically no longer have film based cameras . the author discusses a technique called adaptive enterprise that churchill used in modifying the way an organization behaves in the face of change . the comparisons are very interesting to a history buff , and have direct applicability if you are manufacturing buggy whips when henry ford comes along
this book has something for every event in a garden . planting , designing , what to grow and how to grow it . it is one of the most useful gardening books that i have on my shelf and use it often . in the winter its great to read and work out any previous season problems and plan for the new year
the greatest show ever to hit t.v . you will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great , it always keeps you guessing and wanting more.c.t.u ( counter terrorist unit ) and c.t.u operative jack bauer ( keifer sutherland ) try and stop terrorist threats all within <NUM> hours which is in real time . what i like about this show is that keifer sutherlands character jack bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against c.t.u or the president . another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show , so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more . you still reading , stop and go buy the first season right now . hell , buy all <NUM> right now thats how good it is
`` and so ? i know : extrapolating bandwidth , processor speed , network dimensions , or the shrinking size of electromechanical devices has become truly tiresome . moore 's law , first expounded by gordon moore in <NUM> , is indeed a stroke of brilliance , but one more mention of it should make you puke . terabit access , petahertz processors , planetary networks , and disk drives on the heads of pins will be ... they 'll just be . face it - the digital revolution is over . '' -- nicholas negroponte , 12/98 maybe this will silence some of the recent critics who 've been tearing into this book . yes , this stuff was actually interesting at one point , but we 've heard too much about it at this point . i own the book , and enjoy re-reading it occasionally ( * very * occasionally ) when i have nothing better to do , just to get some perspective on how things looked in <NUM> . seems like a century ago , does it not ? things change so fast in the digital age that books like this are doomed to obscurity <NUM> months after they 're published . but in my opinion perspective on the past can be priceless , because knowing where we 've been helps us figure out where to go next .
i think this is one of the best films i 've seen in this life . i always wondered what they did to represent a date in the past as well as they did while i watched the movie . the music was a major groundbreaker in helping creating a totally nerve wrecking feeling of belonging to the past . this is music for the mind . it seems to speak a language of its own . i didnt know that i liked scores and instruments before i heard the music of `` road to perdition '' its so complete in its mesmerising process that it makes me want to salute it . certainly the best music i 've heard for any film . i liked the music to `` the village '' too . passion of the christ is another favourite
i bought this album after listening to an interview with chick corea on npr over the summer last year . in the interview he was asked the quintessential question : `` what is your favorite album that you 've put out over the years ? '' . his answer was this album . the album stands up to that testament . the emotion , energy , and talent of chick and his band is incredible . every time i listen to this album i hear something new . i 'd give it <NUM> stars if i could
my daughter loes this movie . she was n't a big watcher of jimmy before this , but now just wants to see it over and over
when the wailers were signed to island records in <NUM> , this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience . the wailers were already famous throughout the carribbean , but worldwide they were nobody 's . catch a fire changed all that . this was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out . this artwork is not original . the sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an american and english audience . the first disc is all the original jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in <NUM> . the original mixes have such a feel to them , and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the carribbean . the wailers first album has a feel unlike any other bob marley , peter tosh , or bunny wailer solo album . the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was . with the barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young tyrone downie on the keyobards , this band was well on the path to stardom , and catch a fire was the start . if you have a music collection , you need this deluxe edition in your collection
i 've just gotten hip to the hotel costes series by stephane pompougnac ( so i 'm <NUM> years behind with this review -- please , bare with me ! ) ... i 'm one of those people who do n't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff -- at any rate , i started buying this series outta order ... i bought # <NUM> first , # <NUM> was too latin for me to purchase , # <NUM> too expensive , and # <NUM> was unavailable ... soo , i decided on & quot ; la suite & quot ; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it . well , some of them anyway . the ubiquitous & quot ; jazz music & quot ; by de-phazz almost made me not buy this set , but i said , what the hell ? it wo n't be the first time i bought a mix/comp cd with songs i 've already seen or heard a million times already . how does that work anyway ? what ? certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something ? ahem ... as usual , i digress . all that notwithstanding , & quot ; la suite & quot ; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house , as i so aptly pen music such as that remixed by pompougnac . this whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy <NUM> , <NUM> and <NUM> no matter the cost . hey -- i 'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series , what can i say ? anyway , getting back to the review of & quot ; la suite & quot ; , it 's not as good as # <NUM> ( or from what i could sample on # <NUM> in borders ) , but it does have some stellar moments with the opening & quot ; to ulrike m. & quot ; by doris days with a zero <NUM> remix ? ? ok , pompougnac , what gives ? i thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you ? other stand out tracks are from <NUM> dip ( check these guys out on the & quot ; acid lounge in space & quot ; comp cd ) , sympatique ( now , this is true parisian music despite it 's & quot ; cheesiness & quot ; as one reviewer stated ) , mo'horizons ( nice , as always ) , palais mascotte ( strong dance floor appeal ) , i : cube ( hypnotic with a 60s feel ) , pascal w/mister day ( nice disco-track ) , mr. scruff ( the song says it all ) , boozoo bajou ( nocturanal ) and streetlife ( cinematic and groovy , baby ) . this is a worthy investment for any chill/house music fan . the songs on costes & quot ; la suite & quot ; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end . sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together -- you know the ones , they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of corona trying desperately to look cool
i definitely would recommend adding this cd to your ecclectic collection . it summarizes cowboy music and the cowboy mentality which i feel i have a little bit of . extremely good for the confirmation of being single- it 's okay to be alone
if this music does n't make you get out of your chair , nothing will ! not only are the cds filled with big hits , but even the less widely known tunes will get your heart pounding . great for reminiscing , great for exercising , great for making work go faster ... just great
from the first few pages , i knew that i 'd stumbled on to something that was going to be extremely beneficial to me . the themes in this book are so relevant and i felt relief everytime i read something that was familiar to experience . angry women get this book
i recently saw we are scientists open for the arctic monkeys at the granada in dallas and my , were they good ! usually , opening acts are disregarded , and we are scientists were n't taken with interest at first , but after just a song , everyone was singing and dancing . they are friendly guys ( i met keith after the show with my friends ) with humorous personalities and clever bander and their lyrics , while simple at times , still make an impact amongst catchy and well-executed instrumentation .
the first time i heard cannibal ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video . he did the intro over the first and in my opinion best track on the cd iron galaxy . basically that got me interested in the group and i later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever company flow . i copped their cd , but waited a really long time to listen to it . it 's pretty futuristic , kind of abstract like deltron <NUM> ( another one of my favs ) , while the lyrical content is nowhere near deltron ( hell , what is ? ) it is very good . i mean obviously you should expect to hear a lot of co-flow when you listen to this , so if you 're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up . the cd has some very good songs a b-boys alpha , atom , and another one of my favorites , the battle for asgard . however i think some songs on here tanked the whole album . for one- a couple of the tracks on the cd are weakly produced , stress rap & painkillers . and a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that , vein & real earth . basically this cd is <NUM> % genius , so <NUM> stars is what it gets-and to be honest i 'd like to just give it 3.5 because i feel they coulda done a lot better
this is an indispensible reference tool whether you are just fascinated by food and drink and all things related or need information for backgrounding purposes . i have found it very useful . ( did you know that dr. pepper was created by a pharmacist from waco , texas in <NUM> ? ) the appendixes listing food websites , food museums , festivals etc . are quite helpful also . it 's well worth the cost and a `` must have '' for your libary , especially if you work in or deal with the food and beverage world . . . and if you just love knowing random trivia you 'll love having these volumes to thumb through !
i remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people . all of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth : captains courageous . i think it 's easy to see why this is the case . the story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore , but the story of young harvey cheyne coming of age aboard a gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance , people can change . on of the reasons the film works so well is the acting . depression era child star freddie bartholomew plays the incorrigible harvey . bartholomew plays the role with great skill . he 's miserable enough that we 're glad when he finally falls overboard , yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued . the transformation is believable and by the films end , we begin to believe in harvey and even grow to like him . spencer tracy won an oscar as manuel , the portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure harvey has ever known . today tracy would never get away with playing a portuguese fisherman with his irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent , yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed . lionel barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt new england sea captain disko troop . mickey rooney is somewhat underused as the captain 's son dan . my guess is that if the film were made a few years later when rooney became a matinee idol , he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded . while a great cast carries the film , there are also smaller details that make the film powerful . the original sea shanties add a certain flavor . the special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time , and the sailing scenes are stupendous . this was no small feat in the <NUM> 's . the film certainly is a timeless classic . people who purchase this dvd will also love the bonus features ; trailers of the <NUM> re-release , a short film the little maestro and a cartoon little bick cheeser .
i love a lot of kiwi alt rock bands , and while the chills may not be my favorites ( that would have to be the wonderful band the clean ) , this is , nevertheless , a wonderful , brilliant record . filled with quirky details and loaded with charm and appeal , this is what great rock music sounds like , and it 's the best recording by this talented band . it also has one of the catchiest pop-rock songs ever written , the amazing i love my leather jacket . i only wish kaleidoscope world were still available for purchase . i also wish the chills would consider a u.s. tour , but alas , they seem content to stick around their home country and to play only the occasional show
i have downloaded all of black label society 's albums , and even book of shadows and pride & glory , but this was the first album i bought in stores . i am a die hard zakk wylde fanatic , so , naturally , i love this cd . it combines zakk 's heavy riffs , with his soft melodies like the ones from book of shadows , and of course , his ripping solos . i believe that zakk wylde is easily one of the top <NUM> guitarists of all time . if you are a first time black label listener , however , i would not reccomend this cd . in order to fully appreciate black label society , you need to start off with sonic brew , or stronger than death . some good songs on those cd 's are : bored to tears , lowdown , beneath the tree , <NUM> years of grief , and love reign down .
red haired with a flaming temper , the phenomenal anne shirley is back in her 2nd book ! marilla , a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing anne up ( when she was an orphan ) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins , davy and dora keith . anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble . davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes : like making his sister dora walk the pig fence ! davy ? ? s idea of fun includes violence and humor ? v but only for himself . the girls have to teach davy manners , which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy . anne ? ? s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again , but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world . at school , she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students , especially paul irving , this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen . he brings her flowers and calls her ? ? sweet teacher ? ? . her friendship with striking gilbert blythe ( ex-enemy for calling her hair ? ? carrots ? ? ) has grown , but what is gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant ? has diana ( her bosom friend ) finally grown up ? i really enjoyed this book because it talks about anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever . i simply couldn ? ? t put it down because after every page , anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger . my mom keeps telling me to go and do work but i can not stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written . i like the others in this series also.thank you l.m . montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life ! ~~ referring to the special collectors editio
one of the best albums from my favorite period in jazz history . put it in your collection
as an active duty air force officer , this has to be by far the best leadership movie ever for newly commissioned officers and nco 's .
you ca n't help but love this classic . with the garbage that comes out of hollywood today it 's nice to know there are still safe films available for families with values on dvd from yester-year ! should be a christmas classic
if you have never seen this movie , see it now . its a thoughtfull and intriguing view of the computer industry from its roots to now . sure , some things might have been cut , but if you are like me and have never seen it before , its still a great film . great interviews and funny commentary , and no obvious axe to grind , i highly recomend it
when the corrs deliver it 'live ' , they deliver it real good . whether it is 'covers ' or 'originals ' , it is as good a live album as i have heard . the intimacy with the audience is evident and all the songs stand-up well 'live ' . in my view , this is the best 'corrs ' album out there . bono pops up on two tracks as an added bonus
this is by far one of the best workouts i have ever done . i love it because its not too strenuous but you still get a good workout . there is no jumping around , you dont need a lot of space and leslie has a good attitude and great energy . this is well worth the money !
of the three beatles anthology volumes , this first one is easily the most exciting for beatles fans and collectors . the idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics , and present alternate takes , working versions , live renditions , all of which are being released here for the first time . this volume takes fans back to the very beginning , to <NUM> 's `` that 'll be the day . '' what a thrill . then we hear home demos that were recorded in paul 's garage . this is followed by the material recorded in hamburg with tony sheridan . we are treated to five selections from the beatles ' decca audition . even if it was n't the greatest tape the beatles could 've made , i 'm sure decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the beatles ! it gets better and better as time goes by . the beatles sang `` i 'll get you '' at the london palladium in <NUM> , and `` all my loving '' on ed sullivan in <NUM> . both of those recordings are presented here . other highlights include : * one after <NUM> - i actually prefer this version to the one that got released in <NUM> . * eight days a week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well . also the false starts were interesting . * how do you do it - the unreleased single . * free as a bird - a new beatles masterpiece . die-hard beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set !
what a change for bob dylan . first he was a folk singer , than a hard rocker and now it seems he 'd turned direction , going a bit country . however , do n't make any mistake , just because he 's got country musicians , this is still a rocker and it 's one of my top five favorite dylan records . `` john wesley harding '' is sort of a western ballad that will have you stamping your feet . `` as i went out one morning '' is a country rocker with a message . so are many of the other songs on this record
this cd is a compilation of various tunes geared to stimulate the mind . i really enjoy listening to it
my son read this at his school and liked it so much we bought it
if you are tired of the cookie cutter , assembly line garbage that passes for country music these days , then pick up this cd for a refreshing change . if you are looking for a singer who makes you sit up and pay attention to the lyrics , then this album is a must have . the songs run the gamut emotionally . from tear jerkers such as blue wing and veteran 's day , to foot stomping tunes like gallo del cielo this album covers all the bases
avantasia , the metal opera - where to begin ? a slew of famous power metal vocalists , top-notch instrumentation , and exciting fantasy-inspired lyrics combine to give us the first half of a two-part story created by edguy frontman tobias sammet . note : it is an opera in the sense that each role is performed by a different vocalist . best tracks are avantasia , sign of the cross , glory of rome , the tower , and serpents in paradise . the instrumental tracks are well-done and do n't hurt the story . malleus maleficarum is creepy but adds to the story . inside is the one track you can skip - luckily , it 's only two minutes long
many buyers of this book are undoubtedly practitioners of `` hard '' arts seeking guidance on application of the more dubious moves of their disciplines in street confrontations . if readers expect to be instructed in realistic applications of karate or taekwondo blocks and stances , they may feel misled by the title since such subjects are barely touched upon . macyoung 's purpose here is a different one . `` hard '' arts generally teach practitioners to exchange blows at a certain distance . grappling arts show how to fight an opponent from a clinch or on the ground . authors like geoff thompson emphasize sizing up a potential attacker and resolving with pre-emptive strikes . what none of these address is how to handle the wild onrush of an attacker who has already initiated his assault and who is not going to stand back and trade blows . this book aims to make `` hard '' martial arts street effective not by re-explaining their existing techniques but by filling in certain gaps , principally by applying `` soft '' blocking and takedown concepts from wing chun and silat . karate/taekwondo practitioners may find this difficult to reconcile with their own styles - unless they subscribe to the opinion ( not addressed in this book ) that the `` hard '' arts once had a considerable `` soft '' content , and that movements like those now labelled `` blocks '' were originally something else altogether - but is a valuable and effective complement nevertheless . the book also includes good advice on the nature of violence and how to avoid it , and emphasizes `` winning while escaping '' . stylistically , macyoung 's easygoing tone and humour may or may not please , but behind it is a well written book which succeeds in communicating concept and technique in words . some sections can at first seem repetitive or difficult to follow ( not helped by the lack of clear labelling of photos - my one major gripe ) , but this is due to the complexity of the concepts examined . this book requires more than one reading to get the most out of it , and will certainly reward those willing to do so .
this album demonstrates how absolutely phenomenal a singer and fiddler alison krauss since her early teens ! sheer delight to trace her gracious development as artist , leader , and influence over the decades
to be quite frank with you , i was simply going to come online and recommend that you do not buy the abridged version , but make certain that you are getting the full , unabridged <NUM> volume set . however , i was surprised at reading one review which makes a comparison to monty python . that reviewer also suggested that chafer 's approach was for a believer to check their mind at the door of a church before entering . i must admit , i have no idea where this person is coming from . chafer has one of the most careful , logical and systematic approaches to theology that i have ever read ( and i have a huge library ) . i know of several pastors whose ministry was changed profoundly because of this one book . there is nothing anti-intellectual about chafer 's approach ; there is nothing which is dumbed-down . bear in mind , this is a <NUM> volume set . my abridged version is about <NUM> pages . in particular , chafer 's approach to the angelic conflict is exemplary . i have only one criticism , and that is with the abridged version : somethimes , a point will be made which is true , but the scripture quoted is not directly on point . i do not know if that is the fault of chafer or the fault of the abridged text . my recommendation is , if you are going to own just one book ( or set of books ) which cover nearly the entire realm of doctrine , this should be it .
i was n't a sarah fan in <NUM> when the `` mirrorball '' tour came through my backyard , where `` mirrorball '' was recorded live , at portland oregon 's rose garden . but i had become a fan , and was at her show , when she came through with the `` afterglow '' tour . by the time `` afterglow '' was out , i had just discovered the original mirrorball cd and dvd , and up until the release of this 2-cd set , the original `` mirrorball '' live cd and dvd were my `` most played '' cd and dvd of my whole 700+ various artist collection . but even before finishing the first cd of this <NUM> cd set , i know that i had to have another copy for the car . sarah fan ? you must buy this now . i promise you wo n't be disappointed . it is the full show , with all of her interactions with the crowd , and the sound is better than either of the previously released mirrorball cd and dvd titles . i love live music , and this set is a dream come true . sarah is a true performer `` live '' , and i think is actually at her best when performing `` live '' . absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-cd full concert live set . and if you get a chance to see her perform , pay whatever it costs to see her show
ronald kessler has given us a book that is quite pleasant on several levels . first , it is nice to get to know more about the first lady . while all of the wives of the presidents are admired by americans , laura bush is particularly admired and loved . she projects a warmth and intelligence that draws admiration and affection . kessler gives us just enough about her origins to let us know that the calm and strength we see has been there from her beginnings and what her early life was like . her friends recall instances of her calming influence and strength that resonate with what we see in her public appearances . second , we get to see the truly loving and mutually supportive marriage of george and laura . the stories of how they came together , the struggle to have kids and the birth of the twins , their finding their way in life as part of the bush clan , and much more is quite engaging . the picture we get of them as people is quite different than the phony images the media paints of them ( i.e . george likes to read ) . we also learn a couple things about laura that we might find a bit surprising ( i.e . she is still a `` stress smoker '' ) . third , just as we gain a more real image of their marriage , we also get corrective information about false stories about each of them that were touted so loudly during the election . the fatal accident that laura was involved in as a youth , her supposed drug dealing , george 's supposed drug use at camp david , and many more are all cleared up quite specifically . it is great to get the real story from the people who actually know and go on record rather than the gossip and innuendo put forward by kitty kelly and her ilk . kessler has given us a book that reads easily , is not overly fussy in detail , and gives us a portrait that we feel good about and comfortable with . there are several pages of interesting pictures for laura 's life . we come away feeling comfortable with our admiration for her and realize that she is an even better person than we had suspected . good book and one that you should read in order to get a more accurate picture of our first lady and the president
of course , christopher walken is one of the all time best actors and abel ferrara is an outstanding cult director . their co-operation is probably among the best ever happened to cinema . although the story itself is nothing to cheer about , especially where ex-con walken goes charity , the acting and photography is worth watching this movie over and over again . great acting by larry fishburne as well .
not his best album , not his worst , the predator seems to fall right in the middle . it came out just one year after his last album and <NUM> years after his debut ( right after he left n.w.a . ) , so alot of cube albums came out from '90-'93 ( one each year ) . it has <NUM> songs , and no guests so alot of ice cube gets heard here . it has <NUM> classic , 2-4 i skip , 3-5 are ok , and the others are good . production is good for iots time buy you can tell it 's defintiely from the early <NUM> 's . dj pooh does <NUM> songs , muggs does <NUM> , sir jinx does <NUM> , and pockets , mr. woody and torcha chamba all do <NUM> song . every song samples an older song so it 's not the most original of beats but the samples are mostly good . for fans of cube or early <NUM> 's political type gangsta rap pick it up . # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> ( nice beat ) # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> ( classic -- great relaxing beat sampling the isley 's -- maybe his best song ever ) # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - 6.5 # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> # <NUM> - <NUM> ( has a <NUM> minute intro before rapping starts ) # <NUM> - <NUM> o'shea jackson -- b . 6/15/69 check all my review
i think there 's already enough reviews on this complaining about the lack of dvd features , the quality , and the awfulness of the movie ( that 's the point , people ! ! ! ) . but i loved it ! it was hilarious ! except ... my roommate and i were disappointed that there was no making out at the end ... only the beginning , which was completely irrelevent to the rest of the movie
boy , when i first listened to this tribute to the famous hank williams sr. , i thought , `` wow , how different this is ! '' . i got ta tell ya , all the artist 's on there do a fatastic job ! tom petty 's version of `` you 're gon na change ( or i 'm gon na leave ) to my estimation is about the best cut on the album . emmylou harris ' version 's of `` lost on the river '' and `` alone and forsaken '' are just wonderfull and emmylou 's version of `` alone and forsaken '' is about the best version i have heard of that song by another artist . i do have to say that the worst of all takes on the album is johnny cash 's `` i dreamed about mama last night '' . thank goodness it 's the last song on the album . maybe it is because i never liked the song in the first place . i do like johnny though . the true hank sr. fan will love this ablum . especially if your a music fan
economist joseph a. schumpeter 's keen intellect makes some of today 's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows . some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century . only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse , he was probably correct that it eventually would . schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies , news he feels society should greet with angst . he believed that capitalism 's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat , but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control . fully understanding this complex , although non-mathematical , treatise may require some background ; it is not a book for the novice . while this <NUM> classic may seem dated in spots , those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism 's grave should consider that schumpeter expected socialism 's dominance to take a century or more . we recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic , economic case for the rise of socialism
this is one of my all time favorite movies , not just because it is a great romance , but because it is about a woman defining her own destiny , which is a theme i love . the set design and costume design perfectly capture the feeling of early twentieth century . i hate watching 'period ' that are ruined by the costume , makeup , and set designers ' attempt to make the antique look seem modern , pride and prejudice with kiera knightley is a perfect example . this is a great movie , wonderfully told . i cry every time i watch it . recommended
i 've taken live pilates lessons in class and one-on-one setting . due to cost/transportation restraints , i wanted to keep up the progress i was seeing in my abs/core ( that no length or amount of sustained crunches ever gave me ) . i tried many and learned from many instructors via dvd , but once i got to hilary 's dvd-i realized i found the 'one ' who could both instruct and inspire most like a live instruction setting . her method is not commercialized , but personalized in its relaxed setting yet still true to the philosophy of joseph pilates without being too highbrow for a groggy early morning or weary late evening . in <NUM> minutes , you will cover a number of the standard pilates movements without losing focus on quality of movement over quantity . she 's very easy to spend time with . at the end of the workout , i 'm lightly sweating , stretched out , abs worked and feeling very feminine and strong .. get it . i hope you make the same and more progress than i have
the thing that we in our time fail at is to disapprove of someone for the right reasons . the true historical significance of hitler and the nazis is not well known . an earlier reviewer ntioned that germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the nazis started to vie for power . this can not be denied . nor can it be denied that hitler repaired germany 's economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought germany to the forefront of world power . what is not understood is the true threat that hitler posed . the <NUM> points of the national aryan socialist party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve . number <NUM> clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking ; and felt that it was crippling europe 's economy . of course they blamed the jews : but this broad-stroke was clearly one of hitler 's failures . what is significant is that once hitler declared this ; the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them . any nation who seeks economic autonomy can not be tolerated . in fact , almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely busines deals gone sour . hitler never wanted war with england . it was in churchil 's interests to instigate war , owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite . having said that , there is the quality of the nation-state , and its upliftment wherein hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer . he was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims . he wa sthe first human being to appear on a public tv broadcast , he used radio and tv and in this case , cinema , to great effect . the holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide ( unfortunately , not the last ) . watching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion : and in human psychology . there was , within hitler and his methods , a cynicism concerning the general state of the people . consider the following quotes : `` i reserve reason for the few , and emotion for the many '' `` if i approached my audiences with reasoned arguments , they would n't understand me . their intelligence is small . i must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which i repeat over and over again , until my words become like commands under hypnosis '' this is the general opinion he had of the majority of people . and if you examine any modern politician 's speeches , they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences . ms. reinfenstahl 's brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner . hitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny ; and his techniques have proven effective - especially when his obvious mistakes are avoided . he was just too obvious . too much ego . to little hypocracy . we ca n't say we were n't warned
by far , dr. suess ' best . too bad this book is not acknowledged and advertised as his other silly books are . by far the best for the simple moral message a child can understand for years .
my daughters and i love this cd . it is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it . i think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to . we really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to

i was looking for a home work out so i could reclaim a shapely figure without expensive equipment or endless reps . this is it . the lower body work out requires a step and a chair . for the uppper body work out you will need a few small dumbbells and a pillow . not expensive equipment at all . the exercises are very effective and kathy gives clear directions and alternate moves for beginners .

while neil has written and recorded a wealth of outstanding material throughout his career , his albums have tended to be a bit uneven . perhaps that 's why there are so many neil diamond compilation albums on the shelf these days . this collection culls the best selections from his late 60s and early 70s uni/mca albums . in fact , this set is essentially an expanded version of the now out-of-print his <NUM> greatest hits . and while that album supplanted the studio versions of sweet caroline and holly holy with strong live versions from hot august night , this collection restores the original studio recordings . hot august night , neil 's last mca album before leaving for columbia , is represented with the stellar live version of cherry , cherry . but as good as that version is , i would have dropped it ( along with the cover of he ai n't heavy , he 's my brother ) for cold water morning , glory road and two-bit manchild . that 's a minor quibble though , as this set does contain all of the essential recordings from the period in breathtakingly pristine sound quality . several reviewers have complained about the lack of certain songs ( heartlight , kentucky woman , thank the lord for the night time , etc. ) . for the record , this is a compilation of neil 's best work from his uni/mca recording era ( 1968-1972 ) . the early singles ( thank the lord for the night time , kentucky woman , solitary man and the original studio version of cherry , cherry ) were recorded for bang records in <NUM> and <NUM> . the best collection of the early bang records material is classics : the early years . america and love on the rocks were recorded for capitol while most later era songs like september morn , if you know what i mean and heartlight were recorded for columbia ( beginning with the jonathan livingston seagull album in <NUM> ) . the best single-disc collection of neil 's columbia material is probably <NUM> greatest hits , volume ii . fans interested in purchasing a career spanning retrsopective may be tempted to buy greatest hits 1966-1992 or the essential neil diamond but both of those compilations suffer from the inclusion of inferior live versions of in place of the original studio recordings . the career spanning box set , in my lifetime , largely avoids the live version replacement issue that plagues other compilations but it suffers from its own share of problems , namely an abundance of mildly interesting ( but ultimately unnecessary ) rarities . the most efficient method of compiling your own triple disc , career spanning box set is to purchase these three titles : classics - the early years [ neil 's bang records recordings from 1966-1967 ] , the neil diamond collection [ the uni/mca sampler reviewed above ] , and <NUM> greatest hits volume ii [ the best of the capitol and columbia years ] .
though i have since made a career change , i realized , as i read this book for the umpteenth time a few weeks ago , it was one of the driving forces in my decision to become a counselor . many times i have seen in families , the battered women and children i 've worked with and counseled , the need to love and be loved , to not be lonely . we are told that we will become more lovable as we choose the right clothes , perfume , shampoo , even toothpaste ! the list of products , guaranteeing that we will have would-be lovers banging at our door , that we will never be lonely as long as we buy these products is endless . our media-oriented society measures lovability by : popularity , sex-appeal , the right clothes and products . living by these standards alone makes us lonely , especially if we ca n't live up to them . these standards are only masks , hiding us from not only our inner selves , but those of others as well . marie , the main character in the book `` daughter of earth '' struggles with her loneliness . she wants what we all want - to be loved and not have to prove that we are adequate enough to be loved . `` marie lives out her whole life struggling to act as a whole person - to give and receive love in a relationship of equality - and to work against oppression - despite the image that inhabits her imagination . '' from a very young age , marie learned of the world 's contradictions . she learned how devalued women were , `` that even male animals cost more than female animals and seemed more valuable ; that male fowls cost more than females and were chosen with more care . '' with the birth of her little brother , marie realized how important a son was for there was much celebration as cigars and whiskey were passed around . she also saw how the lives of those in poverty were worthless and that `` the companies '' these people worked for only cared about the profit they were making rather than the lives and safety of their employees . `` coal was dear ... life was cheap . '' as marie watched married women around her , she realized that the `` love expressed in sex enslaves and humiliates '' them . `` it is the toll men exact for giving economic protection to their wives . the weeping of wives - what is more bitter ? '' she sees women become powerless as wives and mothers and she in turn seeks a relationship that is equal in giving and receiving love . she does not want to be like the women in her childhood that have lost the power to make their own choices . in two relationships , marie thinks she has found the equality she 's been looking for . however , in the end it is not even so : `` to her comes the memory of many women who have loved , suffered and remained true to the one man who did not love or remain true to them ; to her comes the memory of a man who betrayed many good women for the sake of the one woman who detested and was cruel to him . she thinks of the great loves that seem to have been great because they were hopeless ; of the night that follows the day ; of love and hate that are separated by less than a hair 's breadth . and she things of annihilation that irrevocably follows creation . but above all , she see that she has had to pay with her life 's love for the experience for which she was least responsible . '' it was through a man named sardarji , that marie learned what it meant to love and be loved . and through her experiences with him she learned that love means to get over who we are because of our culture , our values , or the decisions we make . through sardarji , marie `` touched for the first time a movement of unwavering principle and beauty ... and saw that difference of race , color and creed are as shadows on the face of a stream , each lending a beauty of its own ; that subjection of any kind and in any place is beneath the dignity of man ... '' sardarji taught marie that we ca n't live without loving all humankind ; that we must do as sardarji told marie : `` make conviction the basis of our actions . we must fight for what we believe in rather than fighting for something we know nothing about or for something we are told to fight for . we must think about what it means to fight . we must know what we are fighting for before we able to help and before we can enlist the help of others . '' to break the vicious circle people get caught up in when they try to prove they are adequate to be loved takes knowledge . for as marie says to sardarji , `` knowledge without love is useless . '' in order to love all humankind `` we need to know how others suffer ; and if we have already known , that we should not forget . '' to love without loneliness means that we need to `` experience in our hearts again and again the suffering of the dispossessed . ''
one of the best romantic comedies ever ! it is a wonderful movie !
after box 's first three excellent books , i found this a bit lacking . it felt very slow at times and had a number of things left unexplained . i do n't mind the element of mysticism but it did n't feel complete . joe , his family and friends are great characters , the story definitely had me turning the pages and completing it in a day but it was n't quite as strong as his previous books . do n't misunderstand ; this is still a very good read and a series i shall continue to follow , but i hope the next entry will have a bit more suspense to it .
i have owned a copy of this film for a long time . i have probably watched it ten times , and i always tear up a little at each viewing . from the beginning newsreel , of a shell-shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone , to the final reel of harvey milk 's prophetic and haunting statements , the viewer is mesmerized . though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor , his election in the <NUM> 's , that of an open and unrepentant gay man , made national headlines . he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere , who at that time were unrepresented and , for the most part , still forced into the closet . this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk , but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time . milk was a very eloquent speaker , and his sensibility , logic , and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent . this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs , a buffoon like character , who not only was a terrible speaker , who could n't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears , but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk . the public view at that time was about family values , with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways ( old times come round again .... ) . milk 's voice opposed this view openly , and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented . the notion of this martyrdom , and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk , has been argued . nevertheless , his bravery in representing the unrepresented can not be argued , and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message , nor the admiration he deserves . this film unfolds as it happened , seeming like fiction , but all too real . as milk is assassinated , along with the mayor , by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white , whose subsequent trial , with the famous `` twinkie defense '' , and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders , resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen . as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation , ... if only the mayor had been killed , white would have gotten life , but the fact that milk , a gay man , had also been killed , leaned public sympathy towards white , an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.there are many moving , telling , historically signifigant moments in this film , but none so clearly represents those times , and milk 's loss and legacy , as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders . seas of people , holding candles and standing silently , came together in a very moving moment in time . this film , which won best documentary at that years oscars , transcends its subject matter , and is simply a great documentary . gay rights have made much progress . and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all , excluding those who were there , are old enough to remember , or are gay . nonetheless , harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement , and his legacy , through schools named after him , organizations , and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless , lives on .
if you are looking for a man and a band who can give you everything they 've got ; look no further . if you are searching for music that will sear into your soul ; look no further . walter trout can play his guitar up there with the best of them . he can also do things with a guitar that will leave you speechless . in his hands , the instrument can wail , talk , cry , moan , whisper or do anything he asks of it . his singing voice is powerful and comes from the depths of his heart . he truly presents his all to you in this live performance cd . his energy will be transferred to you and be engraved into your memory and you will be grateful you found your way to the performance venue of this remarkable musician and his band . the next best thing to being there is this <NUM> cd album
this is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject : what happens at death , or near death ? it is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor . and , in spite of the fact that i am a christian , with conservative beliefs , and even though i maintain my faith carefully focused on god , i do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence ( along with its companion , written subsequently , `` life beyond death '' ) . i invite you to read it and see why
my girls loved this book so much we bought it for their cousin . they have a sweet tooth and really identified with the book . it 's very silly . we bought a used version and it was in great shape .
overall , this remaster is very good . but i have a <NUM> japanese lp issue of a night at birdland that blows rudy 's away . check out the alternate of `` wee dot '' on this cd -- for the love of clifford , art blakey 's cymbal rips our ear drums , and ruins clifford 's solo , which is actually the better solo of the two takes . you know something ? i question wrether this really is the great rudy 's remastering , especially when you consider this : when asked , in a <NUM> interview on npr , what his regrets are , without hesitation he replied , `` not having the technology back then to accurately reproduce clifford brown 's trumpet sound '' ( wow , as great as clifford sounds on record , we will never really hear him ) . anyone with such love for clifford could not have done such lousy remastering on the `` wee-dot '' alternate ( i think producer michael cuscuna just puts rudy 's name on many of these ) . i do want to note , the absolutely essential `` once in a while , '' clifford 's greatest ballad next to `` ghost of a chance , '' sounds much better than on previous domestic issues , and alone is worth many times the price of these volumes . i think these rvg issues are little more than another of michael cuscuna 's re-marketing strategies . geeze , how many times does he expect us to buy these same titles ? but we do ! we get suckered in , thinking these will be the best-sounding yet -- just because they were remastered by rudy van gelder himself . how many issues , how many years , does it take to get it right ? for the japanese , it takes just once . they had it right as far back as <NUM> , when they issued the prestige jazz masterpieces series -- gorgeous sound ! ( compare those <NUM> cds , if you 're lucky enough to own any , to the currently available harsh and brittle sounding domestic ojc cds of the same sessions . ) japanese blue notes always sound magnificent -- perfect . very simply put , they are the best documentation of the masters on earth . i know the jazz cd market is nothing like the trillion dollar pop cd market ; blue note and mosaic are probably barely keeping above water . thus repackaging the same music every few years is probably necessary to keep the blue note catalog in existence ( remember the days , just before cds , when blue note lps were simply no longer available ... except from japan ? ) . and from reading cuscuna 's liner notes , i do believe he has a passion for this music . but remastering the domestic blue notes to , by design , make them sound inferior to , or at least very different from , the pristine japanese blue notes is taking marketing strategy too far . i have this strong suspicion that rudy did not actually remaster all of these in the rvg series . if you ask me , many of these rvgs are nothing more than previously shelved , unscheduled reissues and/or repackaged connoisseur series issues -- compare sometime to connoisseus you may already own and you 'll hear what i mean . all in all , there is some sort of racket going on between cuscuna and the japanese . think about it : why , after all these years , after all those issues -- blue note , connoisseur , ultimate , gold , 16-bit , rvg -- why do the japanese cds still sound superior ? ( by the way , they 're not always priced at $ <NUM> -- you now can find japanese blue notes as low as $ 14.29 . ) and , while i 'm at it , how many times have you purchased `` the complete , '' only to discover a new issue with additional material ? the answer to both those questions is simple : michael cuscuna knows what he 's doing . i 've not yet heard a japanese rvg , but i 'd bet if you compared one to a domestic rvg of the same title , you 'd like the japanese audio better . if i 'm right , that would prove , this rvg marketing ploy is a crock . what , rudy would master it differently for the japanese ? important note : if you buy any of these rvgs , be sure to grab the two volumes of thelonious monk . these include the <NUM> , pre-rvg blue notes recorded by doug hawkins at wor studios on lacquer discs , not tape . in remastering these sessions , rudy applied a process by which the disc surface noise is now just about eliminated , and he brought out much detail and nuance -- these monk rvgs are really so incredible that previous issues are now simply obsolete . by the way , as the notes indicate , the sessions are complete , and `` four in one '' and its alternate take are included even though the tray card track sequence is all out of whack and does not show the alternate of `` four in one . '' get these -- ca n't emphasize it enough . on the other hand , on perfect takes , the sample cut from hank mobley 's soul station is in mono -- why ever would rudy remaster his originally stereo recording in mono ! ?
this is an extremely detailed book on allied ( mainly british ) deception operations during world war ii . while it was written in <NUM> it still hold up well , though some new information on the role of gchq and signals intelligence has been released since <NUM> . i am still amazed at the scope of operations the british ran during world war ii . a very well written book , though it is by know means a quick read . it took me almost a month to get through it . if you are keenly interested in intelligence operations try to track down this book
ok , i 'm getting sick of seeing people that do n't understand why mark collie 's `` in time '' is on this cd . let me educate you all ... unlike spiderman or the rest of the marvel characters , the punisher is human . in time he will die ... all it will take is a bullet . if you sit down and listen to the words of `` in time '' you 'll see this . maybe its just me , but i 'd rather listen to `` johnny cash 's evil tiwn '' than yet another creed rip off or a `` i 'm pissed at the world '' song
i have been addicted to this cd for months . i heard one of the songs on the new age satellite channel and thought i 'd give the cd a chance . the entire cd is awesome . the music reminds me of enigma , deep forest , and medicine woman ( except no fruity bird sounds ) . sure enough , as i checked out some stuff about kevin wood , it said his influences were : enya , patrick o'hearn , deep forest , sacred spirit , enigma , and george winston . if you like the sounds of those musicians , you 'll love this cd . the piano pieces are exceptional and every song has a good rhythm/beat . if you take a chance , enjoy
the book arrived very quickly and was in pristine condition . great service
when i make a long night drive home after a loud concert , i like to listen to something quiet and soothing . the pizza tapes is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks , it 's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing . during two days in february of <NUM> garcia , grisman and rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape . as we all know , the recordings were stolen by the infamous `` pizza boy '' and soon they became property of the formidable grateful dead tape and cd trading community . several years later grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album . this is n't an album of electric jams , it 's rather impromptu , quiet and easygoing . some people might dismiss it as `` background music . '' however if you take a closer listen , the trio handles the traditional tunes and bob dylan tunes and the gershwin ( ! ) tunes with such skill , there 's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found . garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to . definitely a classic album and something i received with anticipation . i still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings . by the way , i love the cover art ... the cd case is made to resemble a pizza box . open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings . on the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items ( choice words from garcia ! ) i actually get the craving for pizza when i 'm listening to the album . the pizza tapes sure is one tasty album . great music and great pizza , what a winning combination !
outkast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity . this album is crunk , it 's exciting , it 's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best . outkast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they 're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way ( outkast is the anti-black eyed peas , lol ) . stankonia just continues outkast 's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels . if you 've listened to southernplayalisticadilacmuzik , atliens and aquemini , you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album . stankonia is one of the hip hop albums i always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time . that andre <NUM> is deceptively very , very political , but you got ta pay attention or you 'll miss his messages . highly recommended lp . fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary . one of my all-time favorite albums
robert lopshire made the best children 's book that i have ever read and made me want to read more when i was smaller . this book is creative and very unique in my view compared to many other wonderful childrens books . the first book i ever read was put me in the zoo and i still enjoy reading it . when i was smaller i would never let go of this funny , excellent , and very unique book
slotkin analyzes the popular texts of early american life -- & quot ; capitivity narratives & quot ; of women abducted by native americans , dime novels , etc. -- to show how early americans came to rationalize the gap between their religious ideology and the reality of the wilderness they were meant to transform into the & quot ; city on the hill. & quot ; his careful study of the documents seems almost academic at first , and is sometimes rough going , but when i let his argument sink in ( as a student in slotkin 's undergraduate class which used this book as its text ) , it profoundly and permanently transformed the way i saw american culture and history . this book is revelatory for anyone interested in & quot ; american studies , & quot ; the creation of our national mythology , and in what makes america america
an anime must have . an introduction to an incredible movie series . it started the ghost in the shell stand alone complex .
this is a great book for parents , pastors , worship leaders , as well as lay persons . she explains worship , educates on why the church does what it does how it does , and challenges churches of all denominations and leanings ( traditional to contemporary ) to re-examine the way they approach youth involvement in church
it has been a long while since i last submitted a review on amazon because i have been calmly waiting for that divine inspiration to catch me off guard when i least expect it . you see , i had been in a bit of a funk lately , as i 'd found myself in what was shaping up to be a sizable drought in regards to finding some new music that really moved me , both inside and out . enter : neuroticfish . as menacingly delicious as mr. sascha himself , this fish has one potent bite . honestly , who knows what genre this type of music truly fits into ; synthpop , future pop , new wave , darkwave , ebm , industrial -- -it 's all electronic and good from my perspective . however i must also admit that like one of the previous reviewers , i am quite picky about what i will listen to and enjoy . it takes a lot more than a few 'hot beats ' blasting out of a subwoofer to make me happy . the comparisons to apop , vnv , etc are all relevant , but while i am familiar with and respect those so-called `` top contenders of the ebm scene , '' i feel that neuroticfish music posesses a depth and vibrancy to it that is fresh , exhilarating and immensely satisfying , which is more than what i can say for any other `` ebm '' band . the music pumps and throbs with all the seasonings of top notch dark , dance club beats and is also melodic , which seems to be a commodity that often places it into the classification of synthpop , which of course automatically gets the label of being too wimpy , poppy , sappy to be labeled as ebm ( and i thought goths were picky . ) but alas , it 's not until we hear sascha 's deep , butterflies-in-stomach-inducing voice that the magic truly begins . he sings with a variety of colorful emotions that range from heart wrenching and tinged with animmosity to tastefully demented ( `` they 're coming to take me away '' is a song that my mother described as being freaky , disturbing music of a carnival gone quite wrong , ha ha ) and melodic ( yes , that deep baritone does sometimes resemble david gahan , which is the highest compliment that one can possibly get from me . ) this music has the intense , catchy , and emotional clout of first rate synthpop combined with the deliriously ecstatic dance riffs of ebm . standout tracks are the intense `` i do n't need the city , '' `` waving hands , '' the bomb , '' `` they 're coming to take me away , '' and `` i never chose you . '' pretender and not a contender ? i doubt sascha is trying to distinguish himself as a product of any 'scene ' anyway . afterall , ebm is dead = )
perhaps kurosawa 's most darkly comic , `` fun '' movie . based very loosely on a <NUM> dashiell hammett ( author of the maltese falcon and the thin man ) novel entitled , red harvest , yojimbo employs many of the same conventions . namely , the nameless protagonist who finds himself in the supremely corrupt town , and , warned to leave , stays on to punish the guilty . mainly for his own cynical amusement . the yojimbo character is the worldly anti-hero , and the only truly self-aware person in the entire movie . he sees power-hunger , avarice , and cowardice for what they are and knows all too well how to manipulate the two warring factions into destroying each other . he is a ronin , a masterless samurai . literally translated , it means `` wave-man '' or one who has been cast adrift on the waves . no master to serve but his own need to eat , his own whim , and no devices beyond his sword and resourcefulness . it is easy to discount the yojimbo character as completely cynical , as a man loyal to none , who kills for the mere implementation of a plan , or for profit . but for as skewed his morality may be , i can not agree . the yojimbo character invariably throughout the course of the film makes moral choices , but denies all sentimentality in making them and claims ( though probably falsely ) other reasons for his actions : he frees the woman kept prisoner by the sake brewer and helps her escape with her family ( giving them the money given him by one of his yakuza bosses ) ; he spares the life of the foolish farm-boy who ran away to be a gambler only to cry for his mother at his first brush with death ; and upon hearing the news that the inn-keeper ( his only ally up to this point ) has been imprisoned , he nearly rushes off to face down the dangerous and gunslinging tatsuya nakadai and co. , armed with only a small knife . it is as if he views `` normal '' people differently . as if the samurai and yakuza are classes of people , like himself , who have accepted this violent way of life . that , having made that choice , anything that comes their way -- including death or dismemberment -- should not be a surprise or thought twice about . toshiro mifune 's character may kill an evil man for amusement or for his own end , but he would not harm or rob an innocent man or debauch an innocent woman . he may be `` a hungry dog , following the smell of blood '' , but it is not the blood of honest people . in the dain curse , another of dashiell hammett 's books about the character from red harvest ( known in several books and two dozen short stories as only `` the continental op '' -- an operative for the continental detective agency ) , the nameless man is told , smilingly , by the book 's heroine that he is a monster ... but a nice one , and good to have around when things are dark . i think that very much sums up the yojimbo character as well , and also about how the character sees himself . some critic in a review i read wrote that tarantino does not make movies about violence so much as he makes movies about violent people , and their lives and thoughts and beliefs . i would say that yojimbo and its excellent , hilarious , and insightful sequel sanjuro certainly fall into that category . i think that yojimbo is often written off by pseudo-intellectuals as kurosawa 's foray into `` popcorn cinema '' , but i could n't disagree more . i believe that this favorite movie of mine was kurosawa 's expression of the philosophy of action , of confrontation , of a 1960s jaded-but-not-corrupted good versus evil . also , i would like to add , it has one of the best musical hero 's themes in all of cinema
now i know everybody would love this cd . it is definately for the young and old . the tracks sound great and the new liner notes are amazing . a great mix of loverboy 's best hits , including working for the weekend ! !
excellent resource for any dietetic student , dietetic intern , medical intern , registered dietitian- provides accurate and up-to-date information on how medications can affect and be affected by food-which plays a vital role in providing accurate care to for your clients
i found the book very useful for any budding entrepeneur . one can learn a lot from mistakes from mr. winn . also one gets good insight into how these top company execs think and operate ( i.e not as well as you would imagine ! ) i have the audiobook and the narration by kuo is excellent , very real and humorous
miles always let the music do the talking , so my advice is just listen to this album . nevertheless , i will bang on about it a bit , just like the others . this is a cd i put on after i come back from the pub , or club at night when i 've had a few drinks or whatever . somehow it just calls out to me `` luke ... luke ... play me '' and i do . it never fails to move me ( and sometimes physically ) . it is a strange , dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by williams and holland , with miles gliding over it like only he can and john mclaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work . it is raw , like most miles davis stuff , but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle . quite unlike any music you will hear these days , bar perhaps aphex twin . when i first got this album i thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power . there is magic in this music , definitely . but , over the years i have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures . every listen becomes a rich , rewarding experience . it is a real grower , and calmer than most of miles ' other fusion work . it is a good companion to `` a tribute to jack johnson '' ( mainly because of the presence of mclaughlin on guitar ) , although this album is far less aggressive , and more gentle and mysterious . the album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek , in the middle of the night ...
ever since they vanished from the music world , i 've been searching the airwaves for just a hint of anything `` catherine wheel '' and then blam i hit rob dickinson 's solo album while slogging through i-tunes . ahhh that voice .... ahhh those lyrics ... seductive , intelligent ..... wonderful . i 'm in love with music once again .
based upon director and writer oliver stone 's own experiences in vietnam , platoon was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict . the movie revolves around a young american soldier , pvt . chris taylor ( a young charlie sheen ) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty . the battle sequences are very gritty , graphic , and realistic . taylor serves under the direct leadership of sgt . elias grodin ( willem dafoe ) , but both men are under the command of staff sgt . bob barnes ( tom berenger ) . grodin and barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews . grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict , while barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war . at its core then , platoon is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil . though stone based the film upon his own experiences , there are scenes that have been embellished and the view stone presents is only one view of the war -- see the film we were soldiers for the opposite view as presented by stone in platoon . despite the negative outlook upon life , the military , and the vietnam war , platoon is probably oliver stone 's best movie to date . stone 's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming , to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes , to filming in sequence , to recognizing the talent of johnny depp , stone illustrated in platoon was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with . the film contains fine performances : tom berenger , willem dafoe , charlie sheen , forest whitaker , francesco quinn , john c. mcginley , and johnny depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity , despite the deep metaphysical connotations . platoon won the <NUM> oscar for best picture , stone won the best director oscar , and also received a nomination for best original screenplay . i was surprised and found that i enjoyed platoon , though there were several parts of the film that i found myself aghast . i 've never been in battle myself , but i do know that war is hell . nevertheless , i can not bring myself to agree with the film 's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one 's soul to evil . despite this , there are many positive things within the movie . this is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well ( though they might prefer something more hopeful such as saving privater ryan or we were soldiers )
this very fine cd - from county records of virginia - is superb ! county have once again produced a well balanced selection from the archives and have presented it to the public for their delectation . i would recommend this item to all lovers of traditional american country music . do n't let it pass you by
very funny . my dad gave me this for my birthday , and i laughed my but off . it was kind of depressing since he was a raging alcholoic , but in the end , that is what makes hime the most fuinny . cheap and a classic
i recently became interested in gardening ( now that i have a yard in which i can plant ) . this is one of my favorite books on gardening and landscaping . great resource for those of us living in the northeast . full of wonderful photos , explanations and illustrations . it gives many ideas for addressing certain areas of your yard ( i.e . front entryway , patio , rock wall ) . explanations are excellent ; i learned a great deal from this book . very well written . highly recommended
i have to say , a lot of people will find this book to appear unbiblical if they do not know their scriptures exceptionally well . the scriptures do not say , `` the 2nd coming is the final coming '' - otherwise the dispensational millenialists ( `` left behind '' ideology ) would really be in trouble since they have at least <NUM> returns of christ , the `` hidden '' rapture before the tribulation ( book <NUM> in the left behind series ) , as well as the `` glorious appearing '' ( the final book in the left behind series ) . this book is a good example of what theologians ( like myself ) refer to as `` speculative theology '' - theology based not on what scripture says , but what scripture has not discussed one way or the other . he asks the question : could christ have an `` intermediate return '' before the `` glorious appearing , '' but nothing like what the `` left behind '' ideology is projecting ? could the current state of israel be about bringing forth this intermediate return , and not the final one ? or could it have nothing to do with the final return ? all these questions are thrown out there for the reader to contemplate and consider . excellent piece , well worth the money
just in case any of you guys were wondering what the song is that 's playing during one of the strip club scenes with method man , it 's called & quot ; bam bam & quot ; by sister nancy
i 'll always be a country girl at heart , and this book appeals to that heart . i got philip gulley 's book and & quot ; people of passion & quot ; by carl mays at the same time , and immensely enjoyed them both ( even though they are quite different ) . front porch tales is about the author 's life and the people with whom he has come in contact in his small town . through short , interesting , and witty stories , he reveals much about human nature and what makes people tick . through his tales , gulley emphasizes grabbing hold of life and really living it rather than just plodding through . it 's a simple book , but certainly one that should not be overlooked , because of the value it offers . this easy , flowing , and fun read left me uplifited and i recommend it to other readers who want to get more out of the life that god has given them .
as a male this book has enlightened me to aspects of womyns psychology , as well as my own feminine part of my psyche . she gives a personal example , a community example and how globally these psychologies effect us all . i applauded at the end ! one of the best books i 've read . compulsory reading for men
lucio fulcis zombi <NUM> is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made [ dawn of the dead is a close second ] and should be in every horror fans collection . people say that its a rip off of romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead . romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture is actually quite original . the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective . the zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies are rotting , decaying monsters . each one has its own original qualities . the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing . it takes like <NUM> minutes for the film to get going , but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking of gore , zombi <NUM> has plenty of it . the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly .
as said in the title , strange days is one of the best movies ever and the soundtrack is really part of it . there is music through the whole film that is very important . it 's there to show the viewers all the different emotions the characters have . juliette lewis who is actually an actress sings a song called 'hardly wait'- it 's a metal song which is very angry and very cool . jeriko one- the black rapper who was shot in the movie and who actually the whole film 's about ( and who 's also just an actor ) appears with 'herewecome'- a rap song which tells the struggle and pain colored people had and still have to go through . it 's a very powerful song ! skunk anansie have two great metal songs like strange fruit who also appear with a metal song called 'no white clouds'- one of the coolest i 've ever heard ! the group prong made a metal cover of the door 's 'strange days ' which is respectful to the original and very cool . the dance song from peter gabriel and deep forest is great- just like sachel 's 'walk in freedom ' which is very beautyful . in short words ; - ) i love this album and i know you 'd like it too- it 's really worth to buy
there are several books out there filled with ginsbergs ponderings ( i 've looked at most of them ) ... so why pick this one ? for one ... this collection spans <NUM> years of a. ginsberg 's work . highlighting poetry that the author selected personally . sure here you will find the ever famous & quot ; howl & quot ; , & quot ; sunflower sutra & quot ; and & quot ; america & quot ; as well as , & quot ; elegy for neal cassady & quot ; which was written by ginsberg shortly after hearing of his long time friend 's death . however , where many of these sort of books highlight one particular phase the author has gone through ( like a gallery showing of only picasso 's blue phase ) this tome lets the reader experience the entire ginsberg . i highly suggest this book for anyone who is interested in getting to know ginsberg and in experiencing his greatness which spanned over <NUM> years ( longer then his friend kerouac was on the planet )
`` ginger snaps '' is an interesting werewolf flick , in that at first we 're not quite sure if maybe it is n't just hormones that is making ginger act so strangely . but her sister soon learns the truth and sets out to try to cure her . i do n't want to give too many details - i 'm certain other reviewers have - but i will say that i liked this movie . it is n't among my very favorites , but it is a good , solid werewolf horror flick with a few new twists that make it very worthwhile to watch . like all traditional werewolf movies , it has a terribly sad ending . but if we wanted to laugh , we 'd watch `` teen wolf , '' now , would n't we
anyone who has seen the mi films will not be disapointed with this series and it isnt about bike chases car chases blowing things up all the time etc it is about careful srtategic planning with gadgets or masks or by any other means to dupe the perpetrators involved in to believing something is really happening so the mi team can remove them to stop them being a threat to society . each member has his own skills . i think you will enjoy this series it gets better as it goes on
those of you who are n't familiar with ofra haza , i encourage you to please listen to this beautiful woman 's albums . `` kirya '' is definitely a wonderful example of the legacy haza left , when she passed away in <NUM> . although some call her the `` madonna of the middle east , '' in my opinion i think she is far more talented , prolific and outstanding . for starters , ofra haza was devoutly religious , as a yemenite jew , from israel , had a clean sound , put ancient poetry to music , and used her voice as an instrument for peace and liberation . that is where she and madonna vear off quite differently from one another . `` kirya '' presents a beautiful cross-section of songs and experiences . we hear her sing in english , arameic and hebrew . the songs are about sadness , mortality and love . some great , outstanding examples on this album include : `` trains of no return '' ( about the effects of the holocaust and the trains heading to auschwitz and dachau , amongst many other concentration camps , where jews were systematically executed ) , `` daw da hiya , '' ( about the consequences of a young woman 's premarital affair with her lover ) , and `` do n't forsake me '' ( about old age ) . this is a treasure of an album . buy it today ..... let the legacy of ofra haza remain for many , many years to come . what an inspirational and beautiful woman ......
among the books in defense of globalization , this is among the best for the methodlogical care with which the author has presented his arguments . the text is lucid and very appropriate for students . perhaps the only deficiency is a reluctance to engage the question of institutional reform with the wto that could potentially compromise environmental and social protection . the failure of the doha round and the wssd in this regard is neglected . however , the author does an admirable job debunking a lot of myths that are so vitriolically presented by antiglobalization activists .
stan really did keep and care for james and his family , including when james briefly returned to ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in italy . excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother . please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of joyce 's work ( how stan was pictured in the story a painful case ) , although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees essential to any complete james joyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent joycean faith

i returned from my 6th visit to istanbul a couple of days ago . i took along pamuk 's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city during my stay ... this is not really a fun book to read , though it is a good one . as one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done . the style is smooth and flowing . if you ca n't visit istanbul in the grips of winter , pamuk 's book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways and to feel history rising up to meet you at every turn . there really is a special melancholia to istanbul in the winter and pamuk captures it perfectly .
the movie is similar to crash . it is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration , emigration and racial mixing among modern day czechs . the performances are expertly acted and very moving . i love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to `` adopt '' a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home . it seems when it comes to having a son , color does n't really matter all that much , even to a committed ayran !
but i 'm baffled by this cd . the first track listed is `` elmo and henry '' , but track <NUM> is just some short , faint instrumental . the lyrics to `` elmo and henry '' are in the cd liner , but no such song on the cd . also , the liner contains lyrics to two songs titled `` dance , dance , dance '' and `` promises to keep '' , but again , no such songs on the cd . what is on the cd are some pretty cool songs by a talented wordsmith and musician . i highly recommend it ! just ca n't make sense of what 's in the liner and what is and is n't on the actual cd
look people .. its a bond movie .. movie loaded with <NUM> hours of action , explosions , cgi and hot women , this movie will give your sound system a workout , yeah some action scenes leave you doubting the realism but its bond , get over it .. goldeneye still my favorit
joss whedon does it again ! this series combined sci-fi with an old west slant . the characters and storyline developed quickly , but left you wanting more . i 'm sorry there was only one season
a side of michael j . fox rarely seen . an inspiring story of how someone can rise above their difficulties and turn it into a gift to help others
dvd received ahead of schedule . new dvd in original package , great picture quality ; better that original verson .
just like perry como .. doris day does the same her christmas songs take me back in time .. and i searched for this album on the internet the best price was amazon thank you agai
as i said just above , this is a prime example of what i like to call audio art . from the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through . it is more electric then their debut release but it 's a welcomed change . not that the debut was bad . the songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there . i give it five stars because the music flows together so well , the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less
exorcism of emily rose is such a great movie ! it 's well put together . the cast is amazing ! this movie is worth buying and watching over and over . fatima
this review concentrates on the four live tracks . by december <NUM> , miles davis ' fusion was evolving even beyond the bitches brew era . the emphasis was more and more in the rhythm , and less and less on coherent solos . miles davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn , getting a sound that was thin , whiny and rather annoying . keith jarrett and michael henderson joined the band , lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively . live evil basically consists of several edited jams from the cellar door recordings of december <NUM> . sivad : the recording begins on a high point ; vicious funk punctuated by airto moreira 's squawking cuica , and stabbed through with miles davis ' electric trumpet . this is actually a version of `` directions '' by joe zawinul , although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable . the statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade . miles ' horn is electric , and its sound is a mixture of birth of the cool and axis : bold as love . truly strange , and frankly not a very nice sound . three and a half minutes in , the groove shifts to `` honky tonk '' , a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme . the performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune ( ! ) and one studio version ! miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section ; and airto moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny . sloppy and shapeless . what i say : a feature for jack de johnette , a terrific drummer . the groove is extremely harsh and energetic , with miles soloing with an open horn . unlike the other tracks , this is actually a complete performance ( segueing into `` sanctuary '' at the end ) and is quite impressive . i really like jarret 's electric piano/organ solo and johnette 's drum solo ! funky tonk/inamorata : in which teo macero goes nuts with the scissors . this is actually one big slab of a performance , cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an lp . and it is not one piece of music , but three : <NUM> . `` directions '' : yet another performance of zawinul 's piece . much more conventional than the `` sivad '' version , though again with all the statements of the theme cut out . miles soloes with electric trumpet . <NUM> . then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the mission impossible theme ! so this is where they got that theme . the name of the tune is sometimes called `` funky tonk '' , and sometimes `` inamorata '' . a very long , sloppy , shapeless morass of solos . again , jarret 's solo is most beautiful . 3.finally the groove shifts to `` it 's about that time '' from `` in a silent way '' . a performance that does not shift into the second bassline . halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird , associative poem about the mysteries of music . at the fade-out , you can hear the groove shifting to `` sanctuary ... '' overall , the album is extremely messy , with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing . atmospheric and very dense .
this book was totally awesome ! i mean people think that a sequel would just completly suck but no ! it was great . i was very suprised how the author pulled me in with all the quirky romance , again ! i can not express how great this book is . buy it ! read it ! anybody who loved the first one will abosolutly without a doubt love the second one
the author encourages us to recognize that making mistakes is part of creating . experimenting , finding what works and what does n't work , and going on is the process of creativity . this book is useful for the beginning and the experienced artist
yes , i have seen seventh seal many times , and it is , indeed , stark . the other night i watched the new criterion dvd i was gifted with the lights out , the sound off and volumes one and two of coil 's 'music to listen to in the dark ' popped in the stereo . i mean , once one has once seen seventh seal , there is nothing to the plot . ( i wo n't say that of the dialog because i do n't speak swedish . ) it 's like oedipus rex . this is a swedish movie . everyone in it looks swedish . ( even death ) . death is beyond anything from bill and ted , yet ( without seventh seal ) would we even have bill and ted ? i just like to watch these swedish people talk . perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach , the horizon at mid-screen , and the entire top of the screen contains a horse , stamping , moving about , never still for but a moment . it is imagery that takes your breath away . as an image it is more than i could ever hope for , incomprehensible and compelling . add max van sydow , and , well , whatever ! it 's not a movie that you should intend to understand . it 's just beauty to watch and think about later . maybe always
it ai n't easy being an interpreter . christopher o'riley 's an accomplished classical pianist , but his biggest claims to fame are three piano interpretations of modern musicians -- two discs worth or re-imagined radiohead , and now this excellent exploration of elliott smith . most respectable classical musicians do n't do this sort of thing -- they usually stick to what are deemed respectable composers . and the ones who do bother with anything composed after , say , <NUM> and played on anything other than orchestra instruments ? they become a little trashy by association , exuding a faint odor of music whoredom as they ride the rock n ' roll gravy train from the new release section to the bargain bin . ( this happens whether they 're re-interpreting the rolling stones or pink floyd or , heaven help us , metallica . ) heck , most musicians in general are fearful of doing too much of someone else 's work , lest they be seen as bar-band ready tribute acts rather than as the sainted singer-songwriters they 'd like to be . thank heavens o'riley 's not like most musicians . he seems to see interpretation as something like what it used to be in the frank sinatra heydey -- something anyone can and should do as much as they want to , provided they 're patient enough to really take their time about it and bold enough to make someone else 's songs their own . for that 's the true test of a musician -- not whether or not they cover other people 's work , but whether they put in the effort to give their audience something more than a tracing-paper copy of a song 's original outlines . by that standard , o'riley 's latest outing 's a smashing success . it is a demanding listen -- do n't just pop in while riding the subway to work . i 'm thinking headphones at home , late night , no distractions , just you and chris and chris 's piano and elliott 's ghost . on his previous outings , o'riley had an easier task -- on most radiohead songs , lyrics and musical tone match pretty well . ( paranoid songs sound paranoid . unhappy songs sound unhappy . and ... well , that just about covers it , actually . not that i 'm complaining , thom . ) but what made elliott special , among other things , was the way he so frequently married bleak lyrics about depression and addiction and self-loathing to poppy little tunes as radio-friendly as anything this side of the early 60s beatles . so o'riley 's opted here for re-imaginings that somehow capture the trajectory of the original songs while giving them the melancholy feel of elliot 's tragic lyrics and aching voice . ( check out `` i did n't understand '' or `` speed trials '' or especially the sad scared rumble of `` independence day '' if you want to know what i 'm talking about . ) as usual , o'riley goes above and beyond the call of duty in scouring the back catalog for songs to play . ( if you 're like me , that means you might miss `` pitselah '' but feel comforted that someone out there 's a much more devoted and appreciative elliott smith fan than you 'll ever be . ) it 's a shame this sort of thing does n't happen more often . then again , there are n't too many modern musicians respectable enough to deserve the o'riley treatment
love this dvd ! ca n't say enough about it . you will love it to , young or old . very good technique and fun too
fred alan wolf does a good job of explaining the latest thinking in quantum physics , which he himself concedes to be impossible for us to visualize in many respects , for readers without scientific training . he does this by adopting a historical approach , following the evolution of man 's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early greek philosophers such as zeno and aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as einstein and bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality . wolf includes some mind-blowing speculations about the nature of human consciousness in the quantum universe which should fascinate you even if you find them difficult to accept
this book offers insightful , thorough , and well-reasoned analysis of every modern president , from fdr through clinton , all in slightly more than <NUM> pages . greenstein concisely but comprehensively reviews all of these presidents based on various categories -- from charisma to cognitive abilities to emotional maturity . beyond that , he provides a historical backdrop to each presidency , providing context and texture for each tenure . this book offered fresh perspectives to most every presidency , and forced me to reevaluate the bush and ford presidencies in particular . i imagine most readers will find that greenstein 's book challenges many of their long-held assumptions too
simply the best voyeur experience you can have . the men are hot and not afraid of showing off . the best du stade making of ever
i ca n't add to the discussions of the repulsive evil represented by this movie or its place in american film history . but i do have two suggestions . first , buy a longer version of the movie because these contain the complete version . other versions are shorter because they either contain the much-edited version griffith re-released in later years or are artificially speeded up to conform to modern frame rates . second , read some background on the technical innovations of the film before watching it so that you can appreciate how this movie is the seminal movie in american film history . you can find some good background material online . you will be amazed by griffith 's technical genius . but you will also feel you need a moral cleansing after watching his mocking , degrading , violent portrayal of black human beings and glorification of the kkk
i 've been an engelbert fan for years ! & quot ; the way it used to be & quot ; became a favorite of mine when it was first released and has remained a special favorite for all these years . i said back then he was the best ! he 's still around after over <NUM> years , doing tremendously fabulous wonderful concerts and new recordings ! what more can i say -- engelbert 's the greatest
excellent for nice viewing and music . wilderness has scenery with very few people , excellent music and i have the whole set . wish they did more
yeah its true folks the amazon reviewer was absolutely correct in that the lyrics are simply something to hang the pretty melodies on and the music is nowhere near as sophisticated as blur would later write , but ... and its a big but . blur never again made an album this unabashedly joyful and ecstatic again . mix great melodies , dumb dumb simple but very singable lyrics , lovely vocal harmonies strapped on top of a driving guitar with compelling and dancable rhythms and you have this rolling explosion of brit-pop bliss . sometimes an album does n't have to mean anything to be good
released in <NUM> . `` be here now '' was oasis third album and their last near great . at the time of it 's release oasis was among the most popular rock bands and whatever they made was turned into gold . there was no exception with `` be here now '' that proves the bands craftmanship and lives up to the hype surroundig them . at first listen i thought that the album was a little overproduced with too much commercial appeal but the album is aging well and looking back at it now , i believe that `` be here now '' is an very strong album . afterall it was their last that sold really well all over the world and gave them several big single hits . the music is far from surprising , if you liked their first <NUM> albums and noel 's songwriting you will enjoy this one aswell . i think some songs were a little too commercial , but on the other hand it got loads of energic rockers too and it shows the bands diversity and craftmanship . `` do you know what i mean '' is super long with it 's 7.42 . it was also a pretty big hit in europe but at the same time it also suffers from being too long and overproduced . oasis had always done simple songs but for the first time on `` be here now '' their success had gone to their heads , it feels forced with it 's lenght , sound effects and solo 's . having said that , it 's not a bad song but not what we wer used to . `` my big mouth '' is a classic rocker , that would have been great for their debut album . `` magic pie '' is also too lon with <NUM> minutes , it 's a midtempo that noel sings . `` stand by me '' was a hi single , and a quite typical oasis song , midtempo , good chorus and good sing-a-long . it 's defenitely one of the better songs on this album . `` i hope , i think , i know '' is yet another rocker . `` the girl in the dirty shirt '' is surprisingly good eventhough it was never a single release . a poppy midtempo . `` fade in out '' is half-acccoustic with little instruments used and a soewhat bluesy sound , although it does n't stand out at all . `` do n't go away '' is a ballad , and one of their best songs . the song is about losing someone that stand close to you , unfortunately it was only releases as a single in japan . `` be here now '' the title track is another trademark midtempo rocker . `` all around the world '' that also was a single-release suffers from the same thing as the opener . it 's too long with <NUM> minutes , it 's overproduced ( just look at the music video ) and it 's also too commercial . sure , neither this one is bad at all , it good a meliodic chorus and has got a wonderful beatleesque ending with sing-a-long and heavy guitars , but it was a little too much . `` it 's getting better '' a rocker and a reprise of `` all around the world '' closes the album . overall , oasis last near great album . even if it got it 's faults and is weaker then the first <NUM> albums , it got it 's moments with both rockers , midtempo pop/rock and one very good ballad . the main problem is that some songs are too long . the whole album clocks at <NUM> minutes and was <NUM> minutes longer then the average oasis album . at times it 's just becoming too much and it feels like oasis success has gone over their heads and were trying to be something they were n't at times , but needless to say , it is a good album with a fair share of good songs and looking back at it now it brings back memories when oasis were at their peak and rules the charts . 4/5 stars . good purchase
the story of a squatter family is a rollicking success . arthur o'connell as the pappy is hilarious . the dialogue is cleaver and elvis plays the roll of an innocent , not very well educated young beefcake to perfection . the laughter starts as the movie begins to roll and continues throughout . there are not many songs in the movie by elvis does sing the beautiful `` angel '' to a starry eyed anne helm . i found that the <NUM> minutes flew by and the movie had a `` feel good '' effect on me . the true sign of good entertainment .
if you do n't care for the man 's politics , that 's fine . it is , after all , a free country . but the man has guts , as well as an ungodly talent for songwriting . no one is doing what he 's doing been doing this long as well , and anything he releases is a gift to fans of sincere music . peace
great album , super tracks and nothing more you can ask for , just simply amazing album ! i highly reccomend it ! scooter 4ever
the dvd is one of the best in my collection . it shows you how thes cats are really like off camera . these are some real brothas . bizzy is the craziest little dude . there could have been more live performances . they should have put the `` crossroads '' performed live at the mtv music awards on here instead of the one they put on . other than that this dvd is of tha chain . get this . all bone fans need to have this
this is a great book . it is written for the common person that may not be all too interested in history . i could hardly put it down . after having to read hundreds of tedious history books for my degree , it was nice to read something with a bit of emotion . while he can not be <NUM> % accurate all the time it is still very good for people who want a swift read about wwii soldiers
great performance by rex , absolutely unreproducible ! l & l 's impeccable collaboration is one great pre-soundheim work .
there is an eerie haunting sound to this 4rd album from the band .. the production is noticeably slicker , funky horns , the songs juxtapose upon each other unlike the thematic soundscapes found on their <NUM> prior efforts . if their first album , music from big pink was the soul , their 2nd , the band , the heart , their 3rd , stage fright , raw emotion , then cahoots is the mind .. these well crafted produced songs featuring the likes of new orleans legend a. touissant , a great belting van morrison , all add to a fine album worthy of being part of any one 's collection .. as a matter of fact , <NUM> great band classics , their stellar version of dylan 's troubadour gypsy classic `` when i paint my masterpiece '' and the funky `` life is a carnival '' are well worth the <NUM> stars allotted this review . the eerie vocal mixes throughout , a group somewhat not sounding comfortable but in cahoots with it all .. poised for stardom and somehow throwing it all away in their persistence of authenticity is a theme felt throughout these tracks ... the strained guitar chords of robbie robertson , the pain found in danko 's and manuel 's singing , the ever present exuberance of the highs and lows found in levon helm 's voice and the keyboard wizardry of that mad tinkerer garth hudson all add to an album hard to find the likes of nowadays . the band gels and manage to shine in the right places . the extra tracks are all stellar , endless highway , bessie smith , do n't do it ..
some excellent pickin ' and a wide variety of styles make this a record that people who do n't normally like that twangy , twangy country sound will find quite rocking . unfortunately there is a lot of religious content which some might find objectionable-should there be a warning label on the cover ? i find that if you just think they are saying `` cheeses '' every time someone says jesus it is much less objectionable
i have seen this movie in french few years ago and i have always considered that it was a good movie about india of the years 1850-1900 . radjah , princesses , officers , soldiers , merchants , costumes , music , elephant , cobra , british pride , long sandy roads , battles , etc . it is a long saga . some time too slow but it is a good one
an excellent account of how cubans escaped communist cuba in <NUM> building rafts and sailing across to their dream of america . it follows the lives for <NUM> people who made the crossing . the film follows their struggle on arriving in america and looks at their lives <NUM> years on . this is a true story which is still happening today . the film is in spanish but there are subtitles . get the hankies ready !
if you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature , this recording ( and its somewhat more refined volume <NUM> ) begs your attention . all of the performances are extremely clean and precise , and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive . there are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to vaughan williams in his henry v , but nothing outside of the standard practice in most british brass bands .
the collection is very nice , with a large amount of clothing for the dolls , and hours worth of play time
if you do n't like punk , not the green day junk , true anti-social punk music that kicks you in the face , do n't get this album . if you like music that grates on you , pisses you off , and is generally anti-social get this album . it is a reincarnation of all that is fing great with punk , grating vocals and thrash . not for the wan na be crowd
this cd is awesome ! there are four songs on the cd from cinderella ii , with brooke allison giving it her all and shining brightly . the new version of bibbidi bobbidid boo is wonderful ! they took the classical version from long ago and gave it a new twist which is sure to delight everyone of all ages ! if you have enjoyed walt disney forever , like myself , or are just tuning in , you will love this album ! ..
i borrowed a copy of its second edition a few days ago and have just finish it . i just love this book . i wish that i would have a chance to read this book a few years ago .
wow ! this movie really exceeded my expectations . unfortunately , this movie does not get the credit it so much deserves . berry put one of her best performances into this film . the plot is superb , the scenes are very convincing , and the plot-twist at the end is brilliant ! this movie is much better than your average thriller and one of my favorites that i have seen in the past few years . this movie is void of predictability or any formulaic format , which makes it such a refreshing thriller . do n't listen to the negative reviews on this film , they do n't know what they 're talking about ! remember : if you see this movie with a friend , make sure you can hold on tight to him/her because you 'll need someone
though some people consider cobb the greatest , i do n't recall ever seeing any name higher than mr. ruth in any book , on any list , with the exception of one book which places willie mays at the top . so with that statement , there should be many sports fans and historains who would want to check this movie/dvd out ( though it 's a little light on actual baseball * playing * - too bad , because the photography/camera work is terrific ) . tommy lee jones plays the part as if he 's auditioning for the part of mephistofolies ; or sweeney todd ; it 's surely `` over the top '' but he dominates every single scene he 's in , actually over-running ( with no sharpened spikes ) mr. rhul , playing the ( now ) legendary sports writer al stump . in `` real life '' , it seems stump had to deal with a relatively tame but decidedly moody lion , in motel rooms , in banquet halls , in lounges , all over the place . the movie portrays a somewhat self-righteous writing genuis , as it constantly refers to his own personal troubles - the more he yells at his employer , who ultimately he does befriend , albeit cautiously , the more the very perceptive , though dying <NUM> year old man , reminds him of his own mess as a filanderer and failed husband . there 's a rather unconvincing scene towards the end of the picture , when at some motel stump is presented with divorce papers and he begins to fire cobb 's gun in the direction of this guy who 's been chasing him around the country for this purpose . the script is very strong throughout but here the scene ends on a depressing note . what was needed was for cobb to simply convey through his eyes `` wan na throw any more `` stones '' at * me * , son ? '' well , maybe that 's a bit trite , but the scene closes as lee says that he saw nothing - just a coupla bad boys . lolita davidovitch has some good scenes , but her <NUM> vegas cocktail waitress has the look but not the `` feel '' , meaning shelton probably had to make her a milennium feminist to fit the quasi-political contemporary movie industry demands . keeping the character more to the period would have worked . another concession to the male-female spirit of today , not <NUM> , is in a deleted scene : stump watches , through his office window , and in the company of his secretary , a shapely lady ascend a staircase . in the midst of his confusion and disorientation , he tells his exasperated co-worker to tell his wife , who has just called , well , tell her something . i wonder what the `` real '' al stump thought of that kind of stuff . tyrus raymond cobb surely fought death ... and life . in his profession , he reached high , refusing to be taken lightly or be beaten . as his violent world finally came crashing in , and his health was in free-fall , he still refused to acknowledge his vulnerability , his mortality . maybe that 's the only real lesson to be learned by all of this : even a wicked man can sustain by calling up his reserve of strength and courage ; maybe even artfulness . mr. shelton delivers a very interesting narrative of the back story , though he sounds very subdued - perhaps the memory that the kind of numbers the georgia peach drew out to the old ball park did not exactly compare to this movie about his last days
`` pit bull '' is the trading memoir of martin `` buzzy '' schwartz , multimillionaire stock and futures trader who won the `` champion trader '' title in the <NUM> u.s. trading championship , the `` most money made '' title in <NUM> , and conquered the futures division in <NUM> . he made a lot of money too , but mr. schwartz loves the limelight and a good competition . the book starts in <NUM> , when schwartz abandoned his 9-year career as a securities analyst to trade his own money on the floor of the new york stock exchange , and progresses through his tumultuous , exciting trading career until the mid-1990s . schwartz sometimes digresses to relate incidents of his childhood and youth , illustrating that he was always a gambler by nature , so `` pit bull '' has some qualities of an autobiography . schwartz ' story is peppered with trading advice , and many of its best moments are when he describes his experiences during specific market events , such as his losses when the market surged after the <NUM> presidential election , the idiosyncrasies of trading on the merc , and october <NUM> 's black monday and its aftermath . martin schwartz has a big personality and a frank sense of humor that keep the reader entertained . it seems he was both a success and a failure , having succeeded in making himself quite wealthy but not always wealthy enough for his tastes . but he gives the impression that he enjoys trading immensely most of the time . `` pit bull '' concludes with `` the pit bull 's guide to successful trading '' in <NUM> pages , for those seeking insight into martin schwartz ' success on the markets . it 's a pretty handy guide in which schwartz lists the trading tools and market analysis services that he uses , outlines his techniques for using moving averages and some chart patterns , and summarizes how he plays stocks and futures . that 's followed by a description of `` my typical day '' . `` pit bull '' is fun , i instructional , and easy to read . i was surprised that mr. schwartz sometimes tries to anticipate -or bet against- the market instead of following it . but sometimes he got burned . no surprise there
this is a great cd with the dance movements being my favorite . unt plays wonderully , intonation is great . highly recommended band literature
ghost whisperer was the only show last season that i set aside time to watch each week . i thoroughly enjoyed each episode and ca n't wait to own the first season . andrea 's death was so very sad . i hope she 'll be back for the occasional guest appearance , or should we say `` ghost '' appearance . looking forward to each and every episode of the new season
the amazing power of deliberate intent is another wonderful resource on the law of attraction . while it does n't contain as many `` new '' insights as i had hoped , the material is ( as always ) thought provoking and energizing . an easy read with outstanding examples of how to apply the principles of attraction in your life
out on the rim starts out delightfully enough . the year is <NUM> , the place washington , d.c. sixty year old counterterrorism expert booth stallings is hired by persons unknown to deliver a $ <NUM> million bribe to a troublesome filipino rebel leader . but stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy . he 'd much rather get his hands permanently on the <NUM> million . knowing he 'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law , he takes on as partners artie wu and quincy durant . two lifelong friends who know their way around both the far east and other people 's money . by the time he gets to manila , stallings finds that he has four partners , not two . you see , a con man named otherguy overby and an ex-secret service agent named georgia blue have cleverly insinuated themselves into the mix . out on the rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue . there 's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up . in fact , about two thirds of the way through , the complications start to get a bit out of hand . and that is the book 's main flaw . written with wit and urbane humor , out on the rim is deliciously engaging . but the number of twists and turns could have been <NUM> % less without detracting at all from the fun .
i include this in my `` must have '' collection of comedies . sure the humor is stupid , silly and not politically correct but it 's just funnier than anything made since
this is different from most classical and instrumental cd 's i have . it is neat to hear the euphonium showcased . you can tell that adam frey has a great sense of humor , the album art is fabulous ! the album has a great variety , flight of the bumblebee is fantastic ! i highly recommend this cd for anyone who wants a little something different in their classical collection
i have bought many vcr tapes and dvds of old movies in the past two years because i like seeing the actors , actresses , singers , and dancers of many years ago . `` that 's entertainment ! the complete collection '' shows many , many of the best artists in show business . i watch some portions over and over again .
great to own one of whitney 's all time greats dvd . the live performance of `` lover for life '' is great . the item arrived within a week which was excellent especially as i 'm in uk and ordered from us . this is `` a must have '' for all you whitney funs
entertaining romantic fairy-tale with christopher atkins and brooke shields . the pretty emmeline and her attractive companion richard , after being shipwrecked , land on a lush tropical island . over the years their mutual affection develops into a beautiful , innocent love relationship . but their paradise does n't stay undisturbed . very lovely movie performance about that what dreams are made of
nothing happened to jack kerouac . he died like the rest of us eventually will . jack kerouac was a regular human being . now you 're problably saying & quot ; yea i already knew that , so what ? & quot ; . but what you problably did n't know is that jack used literature to show how beautiful and ugly human beings can be . kerouac was a man equally feminine as he was masculine ( read charter 's biography about his relationships with ginzy , n.c. , as well as the women of his life . ) all of this is touched on in the video documentary , which thrives off the somber emotion , and that sort of & quot ; grey sky comtemplation & quot ; of things , which seems to pervade all of jack 's work . the video moves through jack 's life in a fairly straightforward manner . we see him as a shy french speaking mass . adolescent , a cleft chinned columbia undergraduate , a rucksack wanderer , a chanting buddhist , an aloof catholic , who loved his mother and drank much too much johnnie walker . in & quot ; what happnened to jack ? & quot ; we see jack as who he really was , a confused , tortured , disenfranchised , happy , unhappy writer who was very good at putting words together , which gave an honest glimpse of what was going on in his heart and his mind . there are many great moments in the video . any beat & quot ; junkie & quot ; will love the footage of jack and allen coolin ' it near columbia , smoking cigarettes and shootin ' pool . there 's a clip of bird and diz blowing hot jazz , the beats in s.f . at the debut of ginzy 's & quot ; howl & quot ; , mike mcclure , jack , snyder and ferlinghetti at big sur recitin ' and writin ' smooth synapses of the happenings there and around . there are countless anecdotes and picturs of all your & quot ; beat heroes & quot ; , which portray them as strikingly regular and very un-heroic . the video as a complete work is very delicious , but the tastiest bits come when jack reads & quot ; october in the railroad earth & quot ; to a montage of san francisco images . when a debonair jack reads & quot ; on the road & quot ; to steve allen 's bluesy piano in perfect phrasing and time . and last but not least there is the comical and strangely serious greg corso explaining genious , fame , and why he thinks the & quot ; beat generation & quot ; was a phenomenon . kerouac would problably want you to see this video because it shows that he was not a fad , an icon , nor a saviour for a generation . he was simply a regular man trying to find answers to very un-regular questions and he used his writing talent to unravel those mysteries
elizabeth strout comes back better than ever with this wonderfully written story . a family subsumed by grief , confined by societal norms , is able to , in their own way , overcome obstacles and begin to find the true meaning of love . unfortunately , the ending did n't quite live up to the rest of the book , but still well worth a read
my baby and i just love this dvd . the dances are simple to learn , but they really burn off the baby fat . there is a good variety of music which is nice if we 're in a particular mood- no excuses for not exercising ! i also like that there are so many songs , giving us something to build up to ; my baby and i still ca n't quite make it through all the dances . this dvd really makes exercise challenging and fun while bonding with my new baby- exactly what every new mommy needs
not the best anne book , but good ! : - ) it 's 'good ' to see some conflict in anne and gilbert 's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in anne of windy poplars and anne 's house of dreams
this is a valid reprint of the pivotal book written by the eugenicist founder of the birth control league - renamed planned parenthood when the world found out what her elitist-racist thinking came to in germany in wwii . every human being in the country and the world really should know exactly what that crackpot 's plans for reengineering humanity meant , and what her followerd are intent on , even as you read this .
i do n't think i 've ever rented a movie twice before , but i did rent `` lost '' twice . and now , on top of that , i 've bought it . for me , that 's a lot of money , and a lot of time , to spend on a single movie . in this case , it 's more than worth it . i 've never seen anything like this movie . it absolutely gripped me . the performance by dean cain was so real , so utterly convincing , that it is hard for me to escape the idea that it all actually happened to him , personally . and nothing anyone else did in the movie detracted from that sense that i was watching real events unfold and spiral out of control . i 've seen one person shows before but they were always the type where the audience is very aware that it is a performance . you know the type of thing i 'm talking about - a venerable actor on a stage - perhaps a stool and a glass of water - a bare card table - a spotlight ... this was virtually a one person performance but i did n't even realize it until a day or two after the first time i watched it . the fact that dean cain carries the whole movie is n't necessarily obvious because it is n't the point of the movie . the writing , photography , directing and acting ( especially the acting ) are so layered , nuanced , complex , rich , that it satisfies on every emotional and intellectual level , without additional on-screen characters , or glitzy locations . if this movie strikes a chord in someone , as it did in me , the bleakness of the landscape , the heat , the sun 's passage across the sky , the weather changes , all become internalized . their shifts will become your shifts , and you may feel the connections of the land to the character and events as they become a part of you . you may experience the longings and desires , the sadnesses and fears , that led to the passing moments , and underlie them . and you may not be able to shake them .
this novel got great reviews and then got forgotten . that is a shame . everything you know is funny , sad , moving , and utterly convincing . ms. heller did a superb job of getting inside the mind , body and soul of man just past his middle age . it 's quite a feat and quite a book
i alway knew that dean was a great camidian , but i wanted to find a collection of his greatest hits in song . i found it here on this disc . dean had a great voice . no wonder the olive garden plays him so much in the background . i can even see why regis philbin plays him constantly in his office . this is a great disc to listen to . i did not grow up listening to this music , but over the last few years the music grew on m
you can read the other reviews to see what the book is about . fascinating stuff if you have any interest in psychedelics whatsoever . the long and short of it is that this book is a great read for being written by a doctor and medical researcher . i found it highly enjoyable . the story is as interesting as the research , and dr. strassman 's sincere account of the project 's difficulties and the personal toll it took on him made the book even more of a page-turner for me . note that a small fraction of reviewers here did not like it . what 's not to like ? the book has : a brief history of psychedelics a look into governmental drug-control bureaucracy fascinating stories of weird trips including contact with alien beings the occasional rogue test subject pissed off buhddists an unstable intern hilarious slogans like : `` you do n't come back from .04 an atheist '' and other fun stuff highly recommended reading .
the flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever . extraordinary harmonies , impeccable timing , and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group . the flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated , and most likely never will . they have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy . may god bless them all
ida b is an excellent book . it 's about a girl who lives on a farm . she talks to and names the apple trees . she is homeschooled until her mother gets cancer . then , she is forced to go to a public school . the family has to sell some of their land to pay for mama 's treatments . ida b has a difficult time coping with this , but thanks to her teacher she turned back to the same ida b .
this book examines the zeitgeist or spirit of the age , points out what is wrong with it and how to reverse the destructive trend . the modern era is taken as the period <NUM> - <NUM> and the post-modern as the one that followed . the west is currently in the grip of the pomo mindset , more so in europe than in the usa . whereas reason was held as the highest value under modernism , it has been ridiculed by postmodernism where truth is considered to be extinct . purpose and design were emphasized in modernism , but postmodernism emphasizes chance and randomness . the post-modern spirit considers values as relative and celebrates unreason and the loss of meaning . deconstruction and contradiction are its gods . although the modern pursuit was inhospitable towards spiritual truth , debate was still possible because information was subject to induction and deduction . in the post-modern mentality the purpose of debate or dialogue is not to discover truth , since here facts have no legitimacy . debate is therefore impossible . the first section of the book is titled the moods of the present ; it explores the ideas and circumstances that gave birth to the current cultural struggle . the author rigorously investigates the pomo mindset in the light of the fruits it has borne . this part contains interesting references to sources as varied as the great divorce and the pilgrim 's regress by cs lewis , the thoughts of gk chesterton and even song lyrics by the moody blues ( question ) and carly simon ( playing possum ) . the second section looks at voices from the past , those that have shaped western culture down the ages . as postmodernism mocks the promise once offered by modernity , religion comes under even greater assault , partly because of the faults of politicised religion . theocracy is not the answer . the real hope lies in a change of heart in the individual . this section includes the poem ozymandias by percy bysshe shelley and an interesting quote by peggy noonan , among others . the author discusses the history of manasseh , son of hezekiah . manasseh turned out to be one of the most evil kings in the history of ancient judah . he was a practitioner of `` multiculturalism , ' introducing hideous habits like infanticide from the surrounding nations . zacharias provides a frightening description of what these sacrifices of children to moloch must have been like . it shows how one person can lead millions into evil , when a nation ceases to think clearly . after manasseh , the righteous king josiah led the kingdom of judah back to god again . section <NUM> explores the mystery of evil , with reference to the trial of eichmann and popular culture like the movie pulp fiction in which murder is trivialized . the beautiful poem the coming by r s thomas is reproduced here , and the grace of god and the invitation to redemption are discussed . appendix a : the ineradicable word is a defence of the uniqueness and authority of the bible , a brilliant apologetics for the veracity of the message in our judeo-christian scriptures . it deals inter alia with the transcultural nature of truth and the transformation of the soul . appendix b : inextinguishable light , deals with the structure of reason , certainty and the matter of absolutes . it includes a quote from malcolm muggeridge warning of the spiritual plague of relativism . it explains the relationship of logic - reason - truth and the word as truth in the battleground of the heart . the book concludes with an annotated bibliography of the bible , notes by chapter and a study guide with questions to use as a workbook . i also recommend sinisterism by bruce walker , while europe slept by bruce bawer , menace in europe by claire berlinski , the dragons of expectation by robert conquest , the force of reason by oriana fallaci , the west 's last chance by tony blankley and our culture : what 's left of it by theodore dalrymple .
well , nothing i say will be new considering the number of reviews but here goes : i have never seen anyone get into character like ricky gervais did for david brent , the transformation is total . even after watching the series and seeing ricky in interviews it 's hard to believe they 're not two distinct people . the super-ego of david brent is so hard to reconcile with ricky 's humble nature . the humor on the show is top notch almost completely subtle , even the extremely obtuse humor is funny on a subtler level . the two episodes which comprise the christmas specials , as the dude would say , really tie the series together and leave me with a feeling of closure with regard to the series . the supporting cast did their jobs perfectly , each normal in their own way with the exception of garreth . this normality highlights the ridiculous nature of david 's ego and cognitive dissonance and makes his character even more hilarious / uncomfortable . perhaps most importantly , the feeling that the cast is having a lot of fun comes across the more you watch it . thanks , ricky and steven for creating this spectacular and unforgettable series !
i was upset to not be able to find any information on philipa williams . i love the song `` look in the mirror '' and was sorry that it was not on the soundtrack . although the soundtrack was nice i was left hanging looking for more . where can i find this song ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
i liked the story line a lot , the only thing i did not like was that the author -repeatedly- had to say what a perfect body the main character had . lol . i mean after the sixth time .. we got it ! lol .. definitely a guy and definitely fantasizing when he wrote it i 'm guessing .. perfectly toned , perfect everywhere else . good , now move on ! : ) other than that , i really liked the description of what the `` bad guy '' mechanisms were . too bad i ca n't use those kinds of disguises in real life . very interesting : ) i 'd still recommend the book :
as an author , maeve binchy makes me want to throw in the towel every time i have the privilege of reading one of her books . she is the dickens of our day . no one can bring characters to life , and use a turn of a phrase like her . she is so pointed in her depth of understanding humanity , it 's incredible . i am so glad she chooses to share the gift with her readers rather than just run off with the cash she 's already made . : ) this book is one of her best , with the setting of rossmore being its own true character and all the supporting characters making it a place so real , i want to book a trip now ! bravo to the master ! !
the white mountains is one of the most interesting books i ever read . the white mountains is a book about a <NUM> year old boy named will who lives in a world ruled by alien machines called tripods . the tripods use caps make humans their servants , and to control their thoughts . the tripods called certain days `` capping day '' . every summer tripods come to put caps on people of a certain age . to humans it is a sign of adulthood . a year before the summer that will is supposed to be capped , his best friend jack is capped . months afterwards a vagrant named ozymandias comes . a vagrant is someone who has been capped , but has a problem following the orders of the tripods . this creates a brain fever , and the vagrant starts traveling to different place . when will meets ozymandias , ozymandias tells will of a place called the white mountains where there are no tripods . a month later will sets out on a journey to the white mountains , and his cousin henry tags along . so i think the book is great i give it <NUM> stars . it is good for people who like sci-fi
this is a very indepth library for an aspiring ccna . these books are packed full of entry-level cisco and networking knowledge . however , do not rely on these books alone to pass the ccna . be sure to pick up todd lammle 's ccna book to prepare you for the test
season <NUM> of the l-word is by far the best yet . the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season , and are even better than season <NUM> . they have scaled back the sex a little bit , but when they do put it in , the sparks really fly . i love the l-word
one of my favorite albums ( and all-time favorite album titles ) . enjoyable even if you are not a fan of country and western music . ray charles performs these songs with his own unique style and sound ( imho - most , if not all , of ray 's performances are superior to the originals )
i have to say i agree with most of the other reviews .. kay hooper is one of a verrrry few authors i buy in hardback .. i was dissapionted in the book .. where were the agents with their psychic abilities .. it was hard to follow where riley was going . the ending seems a bit thrown together .. i mean her and ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a hummer .. i like what she tried to do with the book but i think she fell short .. it seems to me kay hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all .. i sure hope the next book is better i think i will wait for it in paperback
david cronenberg 's `` a history of violence '' is the type of film that you may not know how will wind up in the end , or what will happen next , but from the chilling starting sequence featuring what is the most violent image of the whole film , you know it 's a film that 's ready to raise your hairs , maybe for sheer pleasure or maybe because it 's an exciting experience . the film probably shoul n't be qualified as a thriller , even if it is a thriller and it is full of non cheap thrills and emotions , but as the modernization of westerns . it is , after all , a western . the character portrayed brilliantly by viggo mortensen is tom stall , and as the movie unravels we see that 's he 's no different to the man with no name or to will kane , for he is just the `` good '' cowboy , the man that we route for , the man that we want shoots the other men . as the movie advances , the plot does n't thicken or gets more complex . as a matter of fact it 's tough finding a plot so simple , yet so compelling and fun . the movie is quite fun , specially for those who like their movies to be charged with mordant black humor , and violence served in both spectacular showdowns and straight shots of blown away faces and blood splattered frames . the acting is another thing . it is the best acted movie of the year , featuring a sexy and absolutely spectacular maria bello , a spooky ed harris , who under some makeup seems like a man you do n't want to mess with , and william hurt , in a part no longer than ten minutes , but ten minutes that opaque any other film on the silverscreen . add to that cronenberg 's direction , which filles every scene with dinamite , and every shot with visual flair and delight . as the final credits are rolling we get the sensation that this is a flawless film , and as our eyes rehearse it over and over again , we get to the conclusion that this is a flawless film . some may say that it has no sense and that it is ridiculous , but if you think about it munich and syriana , and l'enfant and red eye and casablanca and almost every other movie made had the same purpose : just to entertain . that is after all the final purpose of films , and this one succeeds high above the ground . it is also the best thriller , western , comedy and drama that has passed on the screens on a very long time .
i love these girls but , them trying to make it across the states . i am not sure but , they proved my verdict wrong . with their jobs and nicole and paris going to wash their clothes . finding room mates wanted paper nicole calling them and paris pretending to be an old man some funny stuff . you will love this season they are brillant . sa sa sa sa . night b * * ch . nicole and paris are amazing you go girls
love the music ! ! ! usually not my style , however this is a cd my three girls and i can all enjoy ! !
this is the first cd that i have bought this year and been completely blown away . everything on this album is awesome . i have n't taken it out of my cd player since i picked it up on tuesday . these guys are primed to blow up ! i ca n't wait to see them play live it 's going to be great . anyways the whole cd is great . i love the crunchy guitars and heavy drumming . i ca n't believe how amazing this band is . congrats are in order to metal blade for getting these guys . the band reminds me of an early killswitch engage right before their second album took off . i really expect similar things from ws . to think that this album is as good as it is is surprising . i remember hearing these guys on a compliation and not thinking all that highly of them , but after getting a sample mp3 on metal blade 's website i decided i had to get this cd and i have n't been disappointed . this album should be on everyone 's radar in the next couple of months , just watch . it took kse 's second album a little while to catch on but once it did , boom , it blew up . just rest assured knowing that you had this album way before anyone else if you 're smart enough to pick this up asap .
without doubt the touching evil series is , along with prime suspect , wire in the blood ( also with robson ) , one of the finest mysteries ever developed for television . once again british television leaves its stateside counterpart in the dust when it comes to creating a well-reasoned , educated yet infinitely watchable & quot ; who-done-it ? & quot ; robson green 's creegan has a intensity that is deeply affecting and eminently watchable . just shy of being over-the-edge , creegan is instantly likeable yet worrisome ; like an old friend whom one is justifiably concerned about . yet he 's not so & quot ; out there & quot ; that we find it difficult to identify with him . quite the opposite . nicola walker is his perfect partner , d.i . taylor . like the best entertainment , touching evil is n't a one man show and while the major burden may fall to robson , he is surrounded with a rich and varied supporting ensemble with a genuinely stand out performance from shuan dingwell as d.c. rivers . i 'm glad to see season <NUM> finally making it to dvd ! dare i wish for & quot ; touching evil iv ? & quot ; p
yojimbo ( the bodyguard ) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of dashiell hammett - particularly red harvest . akira kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into japanese cinema . its interesting that the two main influences in this process were hammett 's hard-boiled detective fiction and william shakespeare ( ran , throne of blood ) . the always-excellent toshiro mifune plays the nameless title character who schemes and plots of take down an entire town of gamblers and gansters . i wo n't recap the story , suffice to say that his plans lead into several battles and some beautifully choreographed sword fights . yojimbo was later made ( nearly scene-for-scene ) into a fistfull of dollars by sergio leone with clint eastwood as `` the man with no name . '' bruce willis brought the character back to it 's ganster/detective roots with the not-so-good `` last man standing . '' yojimbo is awash with cinematic violence , but the charm infused into the movie by the cynical , yet obstinately principled , hero surprised me when i first saw it . the performances of the supporting cast , as usual with kurosawa 's films , add depth and wit to each scene . for what its worth , yojimbo has gradually become one of my favorite movies . if you end up enjoying yojimbo , check out the seven samurai , sword of doom , miller 's crossing , the maltese falcon , and the thin man . criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of kurosawa 's the seven samurai , and they gave the same treatment to both yojimbo & sanjuro . a new ( and improved ) translation , commentary from steven price , as well as documentary film focusing on kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies . this review is modified from my review of the yojimbo/sanjuro double dvd pack , each movie is great , but i 'd recommend picking up both
i loved yoga shakti very much . there were <NUM> dvds and a booklet inside the case and the first dvd contained all <NUM> yoga workouts like basic flow , solar flow <NUM> , solar flow <NUM> and lunar flow . shiva rea performs all of these vinyasa flow practices alone on the gorgeous beaches of maldives'island and kerala , india.the extra archival footage included of indian festivals and practices in temples is also a nice surprise.this dvd is definitely worth every penny .
i got this movie for my husband , cause of all the movies he 's never seen it . i told him he could only get his black card unless he has seen this movie . and he laughed from beginning to end of the movie . i personally loved the movie , i have plenty of favorite lines that keep me laughin even when i say them .
riot act should have won album of the year ! although listening to the album <NUM> years after it was originally released , i am so glad i got back into pearl jam . i have not listened to pearl jam since high school -- i ca n't believe i deprived myself for so long ! pearl jam is the best rock band of my generation . hopefully , they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road . for those of you not sure if pearl jam still has it , trust me they do ! ! ! buy this album , you will be in for a pleasant surprise ...
this must be read ferom all ages . im on the third book now and they are the best . its got it all magic , dragons , unicorns , betrayel , and friendships.its an awesome triology ! ! ! ! ! ! read them you will love them
this book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers . he teaches you almost everything on the market 's technical behavior . the naive part is that he uses , in my humble opinion , old school indicators - like 50sma and 200sma . also , he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions . of course , i wish this were true but i think in today 's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that . so what does there need to be ? i do n't know , but let me tell you one important thing : just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back , do n't let that fool you into thinking that 's how the market is _always_ going to behave . it 's an excellent primer because this is how discretionary traders should trade , simple yet effective , but sometimes i think it 's a bit too much on the simple side . 4/
my <NUM> year old daughter loves little bear . it airs on noggin just in time for me to make dinner and it is her wind down time during the day . when she is feeling sleepy or just needs some quiet time , little bear always does the trick . the dvd is great with so many episodes . my daughter and i were more than happy with it . i would recommend this for any child between <NUM> and <NUM> . ( actually i catch my older kids watching sometimes too ! !
as a card-carrying guy , and card-carrying dave barry nut , this book is just plain dynamite . it captures how us guys behave beautifully -- no , we do n't behave beautifully , but it captures the primitive nature of how we behave before , and sometimes during , marriage . since reading this book , when my wife wants an opinion about almost anything related to her , i say , `` i have no opinion about that -- i 'm a guy ! what do you expect ? '' she already knew this , but having the book to go by re-enforces it . great bit about how barry survived hurricane andrew , which scared the daylights out of anybody , like me , anywhere near andrew 's path . great bits about exploding vacuums and a group called the `` lawn rangers , '' either of which , if i read them wile drinking coffee , would put my life in peril . a dandy little book
i loved this album when i first heard it in <NUM> . since then , nothing blues traveler has created can compare , really . it all pales in comparison . for the best blues traveler you 'll ever hear ( although it would be nice if that were n't the case ) , get this cd
i got this cd as soon as it came out . the song `` caught out there '' was catchy and did n't sound like anything i had been hearing on the radio . kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and wild multi-colored hair . i listened to `` kaleidoscope '' so much that i got sick of it and sold it . big mistake ! i want it back and i ca n't seem to find it anywhere . `` kaleidoscope '' is definetly a good r & b album and my favorite songs are `` caught out there , '' `` game show , '' `` suspended , '' `` ghetto children , '' `` roller rink , '' and the spanish-esque `` i want your love . '' this cd also exposed me to the neptunes and their signature sound , which is well known by now . overall , this is very good music
once again , adam ford amazes me with his skills and knowledge with the swiss ball . if you purchased any of his other workout dvds , you will not be disappointed with this volume . once again , he breaks the workout in three levels . trust me , start with the easiest level and work your way up to the hardest . his exercises are extremely difficult to do , but the payoff is amazing . you will gain functional strength and stabilty control like you would n't believe . i 've been workout for years , using different modality , ( e.g . bands , free weights , calisthetics , cable machines , medicine balls , bosu , stability balls ) and i thought i could manage the hardest level ... not ! ! ! i tried one of the harder exercises and almost fell on my face . take my word for it , this will make a great addition to anyone 's workout library and for anyone who might be bored with their current workouts and want to change things up alittle
this cd is very awesome ! ! ! i ca n't through the whole cd because ... i 'm in love with josh homme ... he 's the lead singer from this band . his voice ... is so ... awesome ! when i listen to his songs ... i know that he 's talking to me ! i 'm so deeply in love with him . i 'll do anything for him i 'll even die for him ! if anything happens to him ... i do n't know what i 'll do with myself ! i hope the spell will never break . josh ... i love you ... i want you to hear me sing and you can sing to me . i love you josh ... i love you . i 'll kill myself for you
holy toledo ! what a mix of unbelievable sounds . from the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you 've never imagined . it 's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there 's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they ca n't be sure they 're really hearing what they 've just heard . highly addictive . highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience . `` baby 's on fire '' and `` cindy tells me '' are worth the price by themselves . i ca n't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight . i 'm going to shut up now because i have to go listen to it again . all the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on . this is one amazing album that i will be drawn to <NUM> years from now and i 've had the vinyl since '74 . the cd is perfection . this is an underground classic
tyler perry is just plan funny . i have all his tapes now . this is not as good as diary of a mad black women , but is still definely worth seeing . my whole family loves them and watches them over and over . they medias family reunion is very funny . i will continue to collection all the tapes he puts out ! ! and the fact that he is a christian is even better . great comedy , and that is usually not my choice of dvd , but this is great humor . c
the biography of yugoslavian leader josip broz tito could have been presented in many different ways , taking into account different literary portrayals of this truly great statesman of the 20th century . there is no doubt that tito had a multitude of enemies , but the number of his friends was even greater . i was a child when tito died , but i witnessed the truly heartwrenching outpour of grief among common people of yugoslavia - from slovenia in the northwest , to macedonia in the southeast ( or as a yugoslavian song says , from vardar to triglav , from djerdap to the adriatic ) . i will never forget that stunning sight . it is that much more sad that tito has been much maligned by the radical nationalists , and even more sad that the common people who once cried for him now rejected the memory of him . tito is often portrayed as a communist - there is no doubt that he was the leader of the yugoslavian communist party . but above all , tito was a nationalist , fighting for the southern slav peoples of the balkan peninsula . not many westerners know that tito never allowed stalin to absorb yugoslavia into his eastern bloc , or warsaw pact . tito , along with nehru and nasser , was the founder of the non-aligned movement . the world , not just yugoslavia , lost a great man on may 4th , <NUM> at 3:05pm , when tito succumbed to illness in a hospital in ljubljana , slovenia , just short of his 88th birthday . the world needs more leaders like him , leaders who truly strive to unite and spread peace . so , indeed , may he rest in peace
eternity is a sweeping vision defining the plot vein started with stapleton 's starmaker and zebrowski 's macroworld . extending from the near future to the universe 's end , greg bear paints a vision of humanity ( extended to all intelligentlife forms ) at it 's best and worst , and does it with very sympathetic characters , extensive and involved plots , and ingenious predictions on technology and evolution . plus , the way - a constructed , self-contained universe made by man . quite possibly the best science fiction i have read . if you read eon , by bear , this is a must-read sequal that far surpasses the original
it is a crime that the founders of america are dismissed because they are represented as failing to meet our present pc standards of faux morality . this terrific book takes on every pc misconception about them and sets the record straight . while never presenting them is marble pillars of morality , the author puts all of the issues in their proper context and demonstrates clearly the intelligence , morality , and rightness of our founders . one of the most famous of the old canards that you will still hear is that the founders only considered slaves to be 3/5 of a human being because it says so right there in the constitution . how sad that misunderstanding and misrepresentation is . because each state was given a number of representatives based upon the number of residents , the issue was whom do you count . you have to first ask yourself whom the representatives from the slave holding states would represent . the slaves ? of course not ! so , if the rights of the slaves were not going to be protected , to give their slaveholders the ability to count those slaves as people and thereby become over-represented in congress would actually work against interests of those people trapped in slavery . those opposing slavery wanted the slaves to remain uncounted for representation . the slaveholders wanted them to count as a full person ( does that mean the slaveholders cared about the human rights of the slaves more than the abolitionists ? ) . the compromise was to count them as 3/5 . however , it is essential to remember that those who wanted the slaves counted as a whole person were uninterested in the rights of those human beings and those that wanted them uncounted actually had the interests of the slaves more in mind . professor west also takes on the issues of property rights , who had the right to vote and why , women and their rights at the time of the revolution , poverty , and immigration . a good and informative read . every student should read it as an antidote to the misinformation they get during their indoctrination at the public schools . this book will actually aid their education and help them develop a solid understanding of what is really at stake in our country . and it might spark some lively debate when they go to class armed with some information the teacher will likely find inconvenient or even bewildering . one of my daughters actually had to go to the blackboard and explain the 3/5 issue carefully to the teacher and class . the teacher commented that she had never thought of it that way before . which , of course , means , that she had always taught it as a political tenet rather than history .
this makes awesome workout ( elliptical , running , treadmill ) music for interval training ; wonderfully paced ..... can just see a martha graham choreo . to it while you work out
i really enjoyed this movie because it was funny as well as sad in parts . leonardo dicaprio is by far the best actor i have ever seen
i thought this book would be brit chick-lit with some aristocracy thrown in , but was in for a surprise . it 's an analysis of the british upper class and the aspirations of the middle class through the story of edity lavery who catches herself an earl . the adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story . actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles , but for an american reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary . much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor , the earl 's mother , edith herself , and a host of other characters . things get messy when edith finds life in a stately home a crashing bore . intrigued by a handsome actor , she contemplates chucking the prestigious marriage that she worked so hard to achieve .
... i 'm the only one who noticed that , besides the satire about managements , unions , and their relations , there is also one , although briefer nonetheless most interesting , about 'justice ' , who decides that if one is guilty of honesty , it can only happen by reason of insanity , and , therefore must be committed . leaving management going on with their cheating schemes , workers thinking that getting their paycheck is working hard enough , and unions ' leaders going on encouraging sabotage , following ussr directions , absolutely blind to the fact that , if doing one tenth of the same stuff in ussr , they would have been -at best- sent to the siberian salt mines used as reeducation camps
bosch is back and finally diving into his mother 's murder case while he 's been place on involuntary leave . our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past . one girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound . for a workaholic , bosch gets around . this time , however , our rebound chick has some baggage -- then again-so did our last girlfriend . her husband was a psycho-cop . so maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage . though this was another multi-layered and complex case , i was able to figure out the real killer pretty early . but with connelly , the journey is just as intriguing as the destination
although i usually preffer more energetic d & b this album really caught me by surprise . the beats are so precise and well executed . i really enjoyed the amount of control that photek had over the music . do n't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or dj db because it 's not . it 's an entirely different beast . it 's a bit more along the lines of polygon window mixed with amon tobin 's walls of sound . it 's a really great album to relax and read to . some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great , especially track one ( it 's my fav )
few people are aware that dave thomas , in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the wendy 's hamburger chain , was also the leader of pere ubu . clearly mr. thomas was n't in it for the money , since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers , and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse . the results are sometimes splendid , sometimes things go awry , but it 's always the unique stylings of dave thomas that characterize this raw , passionate music . kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if carl karcher , founder of carl 's junior , had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations
i just had the pleasure of reading an advance copy of john naisbitt 's mind set ! : reset your thinking and see the future . there 's a lot in this book that i 'd like to recommend for those who think everything is `` the next big thing '' ... it 's really not . contents : part <NUM> - mindsets : most things remain constant ; the future is embedded in the present ; focus on the score of the game ; understand how powerful it is not to have to be right ; see the future as a picture puzzle ; do n't get so far ahead of the parade that they do n't know you are in it ; resistance to change falls for benefits ; things that we expect to happen always happen more slowly ; you do n't get results by solving problems , but by exploiting opportunities ; do n't add unless you subtract ; consider the ecology of technology part <NUM> - pictures of the future : culture - a visual culture is taking over the world ; economics - from nation-state to economic domains ; china - will the dragon devour us or will it be the dragon we ride ? ; europe - metamorphosis to history theme park ; our evolutionary era - no next big thing end notes ; index naisbitt , the author of megatrends , came up with a number of mindsets that can help someone understand where things are going in the future . from that initial list , he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter . these mindsets , if understood , directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings . for instance , it 's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything . but in reality , the same underlying forces continue to drive people 's lives . business is in a constant state of flux , but it still ends up being all about buying and selling . in sports , the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in <NUM> , but the game itself was still the same ... score a basket . once you strip away the fluff and hype , it 's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going . or my favorite ... do n't add something unless you subtract something . setting a cap on a situation ( be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant ) forces you to weigh the merits of each item , keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others . something to remember before you make yet another commitment ... part <NUM> of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations . personally , i found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first . while i understand that the visual is becoming more important in today 's society , i had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going . he does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws , but i found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life . definitely worth reading , even if you do n't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out . i 'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain . and do n't be surprised if i turn down some `` adds '' because i 'm not ready to `` subtract '' something ..
just a short commentary - written after a painful divorce , `` bare '' is a haunting summary of the many emotions that come crashing in following a breakup . musically , the songs have all the pop expertise you 'd expect from al - combined with lyrics that lay bare the pain and hope of starting over again . buy it . buy it for your friends who 've been left behind by a lover or a husband , buy it for yourself . i keep it in my album rotation for sad days
this is gerald 's latest effort , and i must say , it is a real smooth jazz gem.gerald really lets it fly here , with jazzy energy everywhere.there is n't a dud on the entire album ! while you may have heard of the popular single from this album on the radio , the funky `` to the max '' , there is more to this album than just funk.while there are a number of funky , upbeat and groovy tunes on this album , such as `` <NUM> on the floor '' , '' tothe max '' , '' throw yo ' hands in the air '' , and '' on the one '' , there are also an equal amount of more standard , traditional smooth jazz stylings as well.not like its a bad thing , far from it , because these tunes help to balance the album out and more , keeping it from going stale.some of the more standard tunes on the album are , '' why georgia '' , '' walker 's theme '' , and `` father 's lullaby '' , which gerald produced in remembrance of his late father.however , even the not so funky tunes shine here , with one of the best examples being gerald 's nice cover version of `` why georgia '' .there is also a vocal track on the album , '' condition of my heart '' , performed by a former `` boyz to men '' member.while the album as a whole is great , the best picks are , '' <NUM> on the floor '' , '' to the max '' , '' why georgia '' , '' throw yo ' hands in the air '' , '' on the one '' , and `` if you do n't know me by now '' .if you are looking for an exceptional sax player , then look no further , because you just found one.this album should be in everyone 's smooth jazz collection.i highly recommend it
once again john williams shows why he is so sought after as a soundtrack composer . anyone who has heard of this movie knows that it focuses on a young irish couple seeking a new life in turn-of-the-century america , and williams immerses himself so thoroughly in that reality that you almost feel as if you 're listening to a cd by one of the many celtic groups like clannad or gaelic storm , only without the vocals . from the triumphant to the contemplative to the pugnacious to the lively rhythm of the jig , every aspect of the irish musical character is here . ( you may find that you have to turn up the volume : for some reason it is n't recorded at a particularly listenable level ! ) there are also moments ( as in & quot ; shannon is shot & quot ; ) when williams 's own voice , so familiar to us from the & quot ; star wars & quot ; movies and his many other triumphs , makes a surprise appearance . once the characters have reached the west ( & quot ; oklahoma territory , & quot ; & quot ; the land race & quot ; ) he blends his recurring irish themes with a musical motif that suggests the newness and astonishing size of the country and the many adjustments the young pioneers have to make . i ca n't help wondering what williams would be able to do with a & quot ; real & quot ; western ( why did n't kevin costner hire him for & quot ; open range , & quot ; for instance ? ) . an impressive example of a great composer 's work
as i never expect a lot from indie thrillers , this one was far better than i thought . although the twists and turns were not quite unpredictable , they still got you some way or another . also , enjoy a good performance ( and some real nice body shots ) given by nastassja kinsky if you 're a fan of hers . to me nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed . josh holloway ( playing the psycho depressed hunk ) was fine too . i would give this movie <NUM> stars if they cast someone more convincing ( like william h. macy ) in the place of jeff fahey . but , as i said , i never expect a lot ...
this movie is hilarious . if you need just one [ outrageous ] musical comedy for your collection ... this is it . zero mostel and phil silvers are fantastic . the entire cast really gets into the plot . you 'll be singing and dancing soon enough
ok its true ttr dosent have the best singer but he can write good songs.if u find the lyrics they are very touching.these guys are now working on a full lenght and eating up the local/indie scene . the best tracks are talk radio and plans to wake up on the beach . strong buy if you like punk/emo
please do n't be fooled into thinking that mr. bucchino writes only `` theater '' music . his songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage . i have included `` unexpressed '' in my recital repertoire . not only is his music well written , but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song . this album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw . just two words : buy it
lately i 've been getting into the harsher side of industrial/ebm and unter null ( aka erica dunham ) is my latest obsession . i absolutely thrive off the pulsating dance beats and just love the brutality of her voice and words , which is really more like aggressive poetry rather than screaming incoherently - making 'sacrament ' - part <NUM> of a twin ep concept - more appealing and accessible with its melodic abrasiveness . track listing goes as follows : <NUM> . prophecy <NUM> . this is your end <NUM> . watch you die <NUM> . playing the fool <NUM> . endtime ( inure mix ) <NUM> . disgrace ( unholy remix by adam ) <NUM> . this is your end ( t3chnophobia mix ) <NUM> . prophecy ( blank mix
for those of you who ( unfairly ) criticize this latest effort by the vastly underappreciated teenage fanclub as being lackluster , i wish to offer a different interpretation . yes it is a subdued and carefully-produced effort , in keeping with their later work rather than the bandwagonesque-era looseness and feedback-drenched big star rock . but it is not without soul or passion . it is simply a more relaxed record , more sculpted , more careful . the music still flows nicely , the lyrics are stronger than usual , and hooks abound . just about every song has worthwhile aspects anda high level of attention to detail . it is obvious to me that the band put a lot into this one , from picking a new producer to writing a collection of grade-a material . why only <NUM> stars then ? well , bandwagonesque is classic , and a high , high bar was set way back when . if this came from anyone else , maybe <NUM> stars would be more in line . for those of you who are new to fanclub and have stumbled onto this page by accident , let me tell you , you have to buy either the best-of collection or bandwagonesque , or both . really . then you will want all the rest . i cheered when nirvana kicked michael jackson off the charts in <NUM> or whenever that was , but i would have cheered far more if fanclub had subsequently booted nirvana from those charts . it could have happened- for all the cobain-tragedy publicity , fanclub writes better songs . this band has been quietly and unpretetiously chugging along since <NUM> at least , while nobody seems to really notice . give them your support , they are a treasure
peter asmus is a sensitive , and involved , observer of the 20-year struggle to make wind energy a valuable energy resource . this book describes the soaring victories and crashing defeats , with the personalities of the people adding more than enough color and life . here are the words of one wind industry promoter who made the transition from dreamer to bank-financed developer without losing his pony-tail : & quot ; kudos , and more kudos . you cut through all of our industry 's bulls -- t with wit and candor , and injected living , breathing humanity into a story of technology . injecting your own personality , as well . despite the obvious that no one can ever tell the true story as it happened , you have done a remarkable job in bringing the wind industry 's evolution to life , and the future of american , no , global , society , rests in your readers ' understanding of the lessons from your brilliant history of our industry. & quot ; wind energy is now harnessed with modern machines in <NUM> states of the us . as we teeter on the edge of another energy crisis , this books describes what some people are doing about to improve the health and security of all people . the beauty of this book is its invitation for everyone to choose the direction for the future
gingerbread baby is a twist on the traditional story of `` the gingerbread boy . '' matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy , but when matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead . as the gingerbread boy does in the original story , the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals . however , in this version , instead of the gingerbread baby being eaten by a fox , matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the gingerbread baby to run into . children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the gingerbread baby inside his house . this book would be appropriate for children ages <NUM> through <NUM> . children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or , in this case , talking cookies ! i think young children especially will be happy that in this version the gingerbread baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end . i recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at christmastime . jan brett 's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page . the authenticity of the drawings of the swiss village and the townspeople is stunning . each image is drawn with exquisite detail . the illustrated borders on each page , which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing , picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside gingerbread baby shaped cutouts . the eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole .
this is without hesitation the best book on css i have ever read . furthermore this book will make me reread the other css books i have so that i may at last grasp all the techniques hidden in them behind all the mumbo jumbo ( you know when the author says `` do it that way because it 's the way it 's done '' - really meaning that 's the way he does it but never explaining why he does it ) . a must buy .
perhaps it was too long ago for anyone to have memories that could correct innaccuracies but few movies of the first world war seem to get it right . this one captures the american experience in that war like few others have . drama and action together bring out a story of depth , courage , tolerance , and forbearance in the crucible of adversity . i watch it again and again . hard to believe it was made for tv and not a major picture . still one of the great war-stories to capture the american public .

set in the sleepy german town of bremen , the <NUM> german silent film `` nosferatu '' is based on the bram stoker novel , `` dracula . '' the film company was unable to obtain the rights to the story , so the names of the stoker 's main characters were changed to avoid legal complications . bram stoker 's widow sued anyway , and won . all existing copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed by the court handling the case , but since many copies were already in circulation , `` nosferatu '' was not lost . in this version of the vampire legend , a young married man , hutter ( gustav von wangenheim ) is commissioned by the peculiar , repulsive knock ( alexander granach ) to visit count orlock in transylvania . count orlock , apparently wants to buy a house in bremen , and knock tells hutter to travel to transylvania and make the necessary arrangements with the count . knock tells his employee not to pay any attention to the stories of phantoms -- it 's all nonsense . hutter , who imagines that he 's hit the big time with this commission , travels to transylvania leaving his wife , ellen ( greta schroeder ) behind in the care of friends . the trip to transylvania builds up the suspense as hutter travels closer and closer to the lair of the count . locals at an inn near the castle are full of dread , but hutter laughs off their horror by blaming the rumours he 's been warned about . even when he 's taken by coach to the castle , and dropped some way off because the coachmen fear to go closer , hutter still proceeds on his journey . the count 's nightmare castle is incredibly atmospheric , but it is n't until hutter slices his finger while eating dinner that it begins to dawn on him that there 's something wrong with this situation . the count -- who does n't look human -- expresses an inordinate amount of interest in hutter 's blood . while hutter becomes the count 's next meal , his wife back in bremen experiences horrible nightmares . meanwhile the count travels back to bremen via his coffin in the cargo hold of a ship . the people back in bremen begin to read newspaper accounts of the plague spreading throughout the region , and after nosferatu 's coffin arrives , residents are found dead in their beds . naturally the blame falls on the plague -- a disease shrouded in mystery . fearful residents in bremen stay isolated in their homes , but death still finds them . the element of sexuality always evident in later vampire films also exists in the symbolic surrender of a victim as she presents her neck to nosferatu while collapsing on her bed . while the film is of great interest to anyone who likes silent film or german expressionism , it 's also fascinating to watch the film and see how the dracula legend mutated over the years with various versions . modern versions of dracula tend to portray him as an accomplished , enigmatic seducer . nosferatu -- on the other hand -- looks like a ghoul . f.w . murnau 's film is a masterpiece of the imagination . nosferatu is a nightmarish figure -- a ghoul who rises from his coffin to relentlessly seek his food . the film -- devoid of the special effects that dominate today 's cinema is gripping , and the scenes of the rats pouring out of the coffin are unforgettable . this alpha dvd was fair quality given the film 's age . it was certainly watchable -- one note however , in the subtitles , the original names -- count dracula , renfield etc . are used -- displacedhuma
this containes some of greg brown 's finest writing , it is however different from his most of his other recordings . this is a dark look at american culture without being melodramatic . i purchased this one after adding one of his finest efforts & quot ; the poet game & quot ; to my collection , and i find lyrically to be amongst his best work . highlights include <NUM> unique tracks & quot ; the monkey & quot ; , & quot ; one cool remove & quot ; , and & quot ; america will eat you & quot ; . other greg brown albums that i purchased after this one ( quite a few ) although they were great , did not quite rate as high on my list
i 'm also <NUM> years old but my parents actually had the lp of this great album . ( what 's a cd ? ) however it 's been collecting dust for <NUM> years since it 's too worn out to listen to . plus , where is that darned old record player anyway ! after recently acquiring this lp on cd , trust me , you 'll be glad to hear this fine & quot ; tribute to the best & quot ; in true 21st century hi-fi sound ( cd quality ) . oh yeah , the songs are all good to , but i 've loved this album since the '70s . ahh haa
i 've always been casually interested in astrology , and casually read books like this a few times a year . i saw this one and thought i had to get it , as i have a few relationships in my life that i have trouble dealing with . this book gave me new perspective . i think i may try some of her other titles
esta cd es muey bueno . pero , y piensa la mismo de los oltra personas . los unas muy suave , son mala . son bueno concions , pero son malas por esta cd de buena musica por bailar . los oltra mas cds son perfectates por un fiesta or por manajas largos . this cd is great with the exception of the softer songs . i prefer those with the upbeat attitude like the one by albita . i like her style . i highly recomend that you buy it
forget about trying to take this film seriously - just let yourself go and have fun ! it 's billed as an ashley judd film , and she 's great , but truly the whole key hinges on the chemistry between ashley and hugh jackman , who is absolutely adorable in this film ! they are magic together . the premise is kind of weird and hard to believe , but as i said , just have fun with it ! greg kinnear is good , too , but the way , as is ellen barkin . but hugh makes the film
the d.o.c . could have rivaled the greatest mcs alive like rakim , chuck d , and ice cube . but his vocal chords were tragically destroyed in a car accident after he released this cd . this cd is very good . it is one of the few albums you can listen to from track <NUM> to the end . of course these days it 's basically impossible to find one . the beats are great , and the lyrics are clever , although sometimes i feel they could have been better . his harsh sounding voice has a nice feel , and although he did release more albums after this one that were lyrically better than this , his ( lack of a ) voice kind of killed them . dre 's production is sick . overall this one 's a 4.5/5 . <NUM> . it 's funky enough -beat : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : 4.5 sick beat on a classic first track . <NUM> . mind blowin ' -beat : 4.5 -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : 4.5 <NUM> . lend me an ear -beat : <NUM> -lyrics : 4.5 -overall : 4.5 a very hot fast rap by d.o.c . <NUM> . comm . blues a break <NUM> . let the bass go -beats : <NUM> -lyrics:4.5 -overall : <NUM> great song with a nice bass . <NUM> . beautiful but deadly -beats/guitar : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> my second favorite joint on the cd . some great guitar solos . rapping on top of a guitar is a very nice touch . love it . <NUM> . the d.o.c . & the doctor -beats : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> one of the ( many ) classics on the cd . <NUM> . no one can do it better -beats : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> the title says it all ... <NUM> . whirlwind pyramid , 9.5/10 -beats : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> great great great ... <NUM> . comm . <NUM> another break <NUM> . the formula -beats : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> amazing song . <NUM> . portrait of a master piece -beats : 4.5 -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> very good faster rapping by the doc . <NUM> . the grande finale -beats : <NUM> -lyrics : <NUM> -overall : <NUM> my favorite track . it features nwa , with raps by ice cube , ren , and eazy . i loved the nwa stuff more than the individual joints by all of them , so throwing the doc into it is like heaven for me . overall i say this album is a must have for anyone who 's into the birth of hardcore/gangsta rap from the golden age
jazz , r & b , rock , soul , funk , and pop music had all existed before <NUM> , but when this album came out , it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today . from recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition , jackson set the standards for it all . hundreds of years from now , this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded . while quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings , jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of `` wan na be startin ' somethin ' '' , `` beat it '' , and `` billie jean '' , songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s , and showed the world just how musical michael could be . aside from those recordings , master songwriter rod temperton ( `` rock with you '' , `` off the wall '' , `` always and forever '' ) and r & b soulman james ingram contributed their own unique tracks , as well . from `` thriller '' to `` p.y.t . `` , every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole . while some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history 's catalogue , i have yet to come across any with as much quality , energy , diversity , and versatility as this one . a masterpiece
this is clearly one of the most polarising of jane austen adaptations on film . some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting , the authentically costumed characters , the beautiful scenery and sets , the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film . others will loathe the complete absence of makeup , the fact that amanda root is visibly older than <NUM> , the slow and tender story , the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the mr elliot sub-plot ( including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards mrs smith ) . i acknowledge both of these views . certainly amanda root does not enhance her natural sweet looks , and she does look a little too old for the part of anne elliot , but mon dieu , her acting ! that is something else again . in terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character , no better actress could have been found . if only she 'd been permitted to `` youthify '' her looks a little ... after all , in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it 's true her looks had faded somewhat , her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest , i do prefer superb acting to superb looks , and that is why i find amanda root 's portrayal so very moving and real . ciarÔøΩn hinds is excellent as captain wentworth , anne 's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago . he is not movie-star handsome , but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes . in personality and character , he is undeniably the right match for ms root 's anne . the interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach . he is very deliberately ignoring anne , although with perfect politeness . more and more , the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them , and the beauty of anne 's character is so wonderfully brought out by amanda root 's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised . the sub-plots are also superbly explicated . anne 's selfish and heedless father ( corin redgrave ) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister elizabeth ( phoebe nicholls ) , not to mention her laughably tiresome sister mary ( sophie thompson ) , are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on anne 's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour . mr elliot ( the brilliant samuel west ) does n't really get enough storytime in this adaption , unfortunately - i do think the script did n't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character . but the wonderful fiona shaw is perfect in the role of mrs croft ( anne 's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times ) , and lady russell ( anne 's mentor ) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by susan fleetwood . i also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking mrs clay ( felicity dean ) and the thoroughly nice charles musgrove who , having been rejected by anne , decided to wed mary instead ( very , very well played by simon russell beale , who makes this sort of role look completely effortless ) . the look of this film is lovely in many ways . the lack of makeup may take some getting used to , but there 's no denying it 's authentic , and with such excellent acting from everyone involved , the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed . the truly magnificent singing of opera singer rosa mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any jane austen film . ( all too often , the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice ' , but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class . or ... if no natural talent was possessed , perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing . but music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces . ) to sum up : for those who want a film that is purely escapist , that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is `` exciting '' to watch , this is probably not a film that will appeal to you . for those , however , who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances , there will be great enjoyment for you
first of all , this review is based on the original ( subtitled ) version , not this disney-edited dvd . do n't watch this movie expecting something of the caliber of crouching tiger hidden dragon ; you 'll be disappointed . an obvious take-off of stories like the three musketeers and with a mood similar to the batman movies , this film is often confusing and melodramatic , at times simply absurd . that said , the acting is decent and the fight scenes engaging , making for an enjoyable film . it 's entertaining , if not earth-moving
i never had or heard this particular album before but if you like looking glass try to find a cd ( or album ) called & quot ; subway serenade & quot ; . it has & quot ; jimmy loves marry-anne & quot ; on it but all of the songs are awesome ( i like them anyway )
come on people ! what did you expect from this movie ? did you think it was going to be like the slience of the lambs ? did you think it was going to win best picture ? did you think that micheael douglas or his hot wife or their daughter would die ? i seriously hope not . everyone knew what was going to happen in this movie . there would be action , suspense and a very predictable ending . no , duh . did you really think that the ending would be shocking ? did you think that the bad guys would kill anyone ? come on . i did n't expect anything of this movie . nothing . and if you were like me , then you would have like it . but , on the other hand , if you were expecting a thriller like seven or the silence of the lambs , then yeah , you 'd be disspointed . but , i decided to rent this , wanting to watch a fun and interesting movie . and it was . i enjoyed the plot , enjoyed the action , enjoyed the suspense , and enjoyed the acting by michael douglas and brittany murphy . i always am up for watching excellent movies like ghost world , frailty , american history x , seven , etc .. but movies like that are hard to come around . in comes movies like do n't say a word . they 're predictable , even lame , but i still find them to be fun and amusing . maybe if you people would lower your dam * expectations , maybe you 'd enjoy movies like this . this is worth a rent if you do n't expect seeing a best picture nominee . but , all the reviewers on amazon obviously were thinking : `` the next silence of the lambs ! the next seven ! weeh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' yeah , like michael douglas would actually die or anything plot twist , crazy like seven is going to happen in this movie . you 'll like this if you lower your expectations .
this movie is a great thriller for people who do n't like to watch scary movies . one of my favorite angelina jolie movies
once again rene artois succeeds in making occupied france a hotbed of comedy . this set has <NUM> exceptional episodes mainly involving how to get the english airmen out of france . leclerc has been replaced with his brother in this season but all the regulars are here . each season seems to get better and better . ca n't wait for seasons 7-9
i , like most of my women friends i 've talked to , including my mother and my sisters , shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time . i bought this book in <NUM> when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support . i found it in the `` self-help '' section of the bookstore . this little book does as good a job as anything i 've read , at getting in a woman 's head . clothes are how we remember . wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope . for a while , i kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever i 'd want to remember an important event . ask me what i was wearing when i held my niece for the first time ( navy blue a-line liz claiborne dress ) or when i went to my first job interview out of college ( a polka-dot suit i called the stewardess ) or the night i was first kissed by the love of my life ( a shirt that said `` keep on truckin '' in glitter ... heh ) . a good friend 's mother passed away a few months ago , and i bought a copy for her , since ms. beckerman mentions the death of her own mother . she also mentions marriages , divorces , babies , and career successes , and most importantly , what she wore . it makes a great gift for any woman . or for yourself
one of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them . the feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as `` patriarchal , anti-woman '' and `` sexist . '' the irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent . as always , the opinions of males are discounted , and whatever words men write are deemed compromised , so let us be grateful that carrie lukas came along . she is an equity feminist in the mold of christina hoff sommers and daphne patai , and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the green berets are to terrorists . lukas 's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men . her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist , and there 's no reason to label them as good or evil . viva la difference should be the order of every day . by the end , you 'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged , and fictional , patriarchy . lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether . you 'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence , that divorce is beneficial to women , and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to `` have it all . '' the real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women . behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes . the only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness . on aggregate , lukas 's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind . in my opinion , she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve . the only negative thing i can say about this book is that i suspect few women will read it . my guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them . what those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself , and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination .
i too , having done much research on mormonism over the years as others , had put off reading this `` excellent '' expose while doing research on other cultic religions . i finally sat down to read this `` work of art '' and truly believe it should be `` required '' reading for every single practicing mormon , but as god gives each and every one of us a `` free will `` of choice , i can only pray that mormons in their `` delusionment '' will read these reviews and purchase the book for themselves and seek the `` real truth '' in the word of god , the bible ! not only did fawn brodie do a wonderful work in her own research of mormonism , but also tied together `` masterfully '' the research and writings of others on this `` cultic '' religion to conclude with a `` true '' masterpiece in print ! with `` all '' of the thousands of expose 's on the writings and actions of this `` false prophet '' joseph smith , i 'm truly `` amazed '' that millions of people continue to embrace and follow this `` false '' religion ! we have many verses , of course , in god 's word that speak to the very `` issue '' of `` spiritual blindness '' ! i find it truly `` amazing '' and a `` paradox '' that joseph smith went to great lengths in his life to expose the false doctrine of `` catholicism '' only to `` replace '' it with his `` own '' false doctrine ! i would `` encourage '' all mormons to take a look at this book with a truly `` open mind '' and an `` open heart '' to the truth of god 's word in the bible . we are not `` gods '' and will never become `` gods '' either in this life or life `` after '' physical death !
i heard about these guys from that movie , dig ! , and i did n't know what to expect . turns out , they 're amazing . there 's no comparison to the dandy warhols , none . why they thought they were in competition with a hack band with a few hooks is beyond me . these guys are the real deal . if it was n't for their lead singer making a jerk of himself and screwing up record deals ( which is a storyline that you wo n't understand once you hear the thoughtful lyrics ) , these guys would be widely known as one of the best bands in the world . they sound like a throwback from the <NUM> 's , but slightly updated . the music is varied and intelligent as anything you 've heard . i guess the rolling stones might be an apt comparison , but there 's something more raw about this band . look , if you were on the fence , just buy this , you wo n't be disappointed
abraham lincoln 's life and career continue to fascinate and inspire americans . richard carwardine 's recent study : `` lincoln : a life of purpose and power '' joins a select number of outstanding works on lincoln written by a non-american scholar . richard carwardine is the rhodes professor of american history at oxford university . his book , fittingly , was awarded the lincoln prize , the first work of a british writer to be so honored . professor carwardine 's study tells little of lincoln 's private life : his marriage , prior relationships with women , his personal interests , his depression , his sexual orientation , and other issues that have been explored in some recent works . he seems to presuppose a knowledge in his readers of the rudimentary facts of lincoln 's life . ( a duel in which lincoln participated as a young man is mentioned twice in passing but never developed . ) instead , professor carwadine explores lincoln 's public career , before and during his presidency , and tries to develop the traits of character and the circumstances that made lincoln what he was . thus , professor carwardine devotes a great deal of attention to lincoln 's overwhelming ambition -- noted by virtually every writer on this subject -- and his desire to make something of his life through work and effort . professor carwardine also emphasizes lincoln 's shrewdness , knowledge of human nature , ability to present himself , and facility at working with and blending together disparate groups and ideas . these pragmatic , practical abilities would prove essential to the tasks lincoln was called upon to perform as president . professor carwardine emphasizes as well another , more thoughtful side of lincoln . his book describes lincoln 's role as a leader who endeavored to shape and mold public opinion rather than to be led by it . professor carwarding describes the fundamental role that moral conviction played in lincoln 's political career -- in his lifelong belief in the evil of slavery and in his devotion to the cause of democracy and the union . the book describes well the development of lincoln 's religious convictions as he assumed the burdens of his presidency . from his origins as a skeptic and freethinker , lincoln developed a sense of a just and providential god directing the course of human events for reasons of his own . lincoln 's theology dovetailed at some point with america 's evangelical protestantism , even though lincoln never became a traditional believer or practicing christian . lincoln 's religious sense and moral fervor , for professor carwardine , became essential to the leadership he provided during the civil war , as evidenced by the emacipation proclamation and the second inaugural address , among much else . professor carwardine offers an insightful portrayal of american life during civil war times , particularly in middle-america as he discusses lincoln 's rise to power in illinois and the <NUM> debates with stephen douglas . he shows how lincoln evolved during his years as president and how both his moral vision and his sense for the politically practicable were essential to holding the union together and creating a sense of american nationalism . as does much modern history and biography , professor carwardine is at pains to separate lincoln , the hero and the cultural icon , from lincoln the man , and from the facts of his life . but in spite of these efforts and of professor carwardine 's own understated conclusions , this book presents the reader with a remarkable man and a remarkable life . professor carwardine concludes : `` while he was certainly not reluctant to wield political authority , his practical policy grew from a strong sense of moral purpose , and his course as president was shaped not by impouslive , self-aggrandizing action or self-righteousness , but by deep thought , breadth of vision , careful concern for consequences , and a remarkable lack of pride .

last month i went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the cover girls-greatest hits . my mechanic said , `` lady you got class ! ! ! where did you get that cd ? my wife only listens to britney spears '' . i love that cd so much ! it takes me back when i was a teenager at new york going to hearthrob 's , the tunnel , emerald city , and the paladium . boy ! those were the great days ! i also have the collection of the freestyle-megamix . worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak , lol
intro-this intro practically screams the godfather but it alwayz makes me laugh ! so good-i always really loved this song . it really talks about the people that never really beieved them . i always thought of this song as a single . 9/10 bills , bills , bills- another great single from destiny 's child . the music video is really good and funny ! 8/10 confessions- in my option , im not really into this song . i mean i like the lyrics but i 'm not into the beat . i sometimes skip this . 6/10 bug a boo-great single ! when it first came i really loved this song and i still do ! ! in the music video i do n't get it when the go to the marching band or whatever .. 8/10 temptation-a sweet sexy song . it 's really good for a slow song about being tempted . 8.5/10 now that she 's gone-same option like confessions . love the lyrics do n't know about beat though . i do n't skip it as much though 7.5/10 where 'd you go ? -really love this beat and lyrics ! ! sweet song about finding her man . 8/10 hey ladies- i love this song ! ! great single for us women . i kinda wanted this to be a single . i can imagine the music video .. 9/10 if you leave-i love the duet between destiny 's child and next ! it 's really loving and sweet 9/10 jumpin jumpin- lovin this song ! ! ! hot club song ! ! ! ! it 's pratically impossible to not dance ! ! 10/10 ! say my name- i love this song even more ! ! great beat and lyrics ! i havev't met anyone who has n't heard this ! 10/10 ! she ca n't love you-loved this song as well ! it 's a beautiful and talks about a girl telling her ex that he girlfriend was love was n't as godd as hers . 9.7/10 stay-this song is great as well ! ! great vocal cuz you can actually hear everyone 's voices . i do n't why but i can imagine mariah carey singing something like this 9.5/10 sweet sixteen- i 'll tell you the truth i 'm not really into this song . the lyrics and melody i do n't why i 'm not into it ... maybe because i 'm not <NUM> ! : ) 7/10 outro amazing grace-i love these vocals ! ! ! it show that they can sing great even withoust any beats ! ! 9.8/10
this is a very entertaining dvd , full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope . in some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current western civilization of america and europe and the islamic world that stretches across asia . i found it interesting that the film depicts those christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those christians that are not tolerant of other 's religious beliefs . in this film , balian ( played by orlando bloom ) , his father , and the king of jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask ) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs . the templar knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them . in this film , the muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for christians . it is a beautiful film , with fascinating architecture , set construction , and weapon and costume design . the battle for the city of jerusalem is exciting , a dramatic high point , and a critical aspect of the film . saladin wins the battle and jerusalem is handed over to the muslims . remember that after the death of jesus , the apostles and disciples spread christianity into egypt and ethiopia , into rome , france , spain , england , and ireland . also christianity was spread into eastern europe such as romania , hungary , germany . christianity was spread into present day syria , jordan , iraq , and iran . thus the sweep of islam across the world in around the year <NUM> brought islam to christian communities and cities across the middle east . it is in response to this growing islamic power and dominance over the middle east for <NUM> years that the crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film . yet this is not a christians hate muslims who in turn hate christians type of film . instead the writers and film-makers imply that the kingdom of heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other 's beliefs about god . this is actually a good message for our day and time - which director ridley scott obviously knows
good heavens , where do they get these 'essential ' amazon reviews anyway ? sheesh . nothing like a good dose of pomposity to motivate a reply . this movie is n't supposed to be taken remotely seriously , please . it 's a goof -- and a very skillful one . sure , the plot 's a mismash of twice-reheated devices , the baddies are about as subtle as week-old meat , and to watch at all requires you suspend enough disbelief to reconsider the easter bunny as gospel . so what ? you do n't go to movies like lethal weapon for the depth of characterization . yes , a bit helps , but ... not too much . same holds true here . it 's easy to ridicule -- but it 's easier to enjoy . movies like long kiss goodnight are made or broken by virtue of their scriptwriting , and the script for lkg can more than hold its head up alongside other genre staples . a good script determines how willing an audience is not only to watch a movie -- but rewatch it . ( and buy it , for that matter . ) long kiss goodnight offeres a lot of pleasure in this department , it 's got more quoteable lines than die hard and -- yeah , let 's be frank : the lead 's hotter . ( a perhaps more up-to-date comparison for tone would be speed . ) the crux of the arguments over the film 's virtues , however , is & i suspect will remain whether you buy -- or want to buy into -- the idea of doing this kind of film as a girl-thing in the first place . ( like anyone questions the validity of the premises behind james bond movies ? come on . this is really very simple : if you enjoy films where women kick @ * * , you 'll very likely enjoy this . if the mere idea makes your lips purse with disapproval , skip it & move on . ) not to mention -- what better place to subvert expectations than at the movies ? though the script may be better than usual , what really sells the film is davis & jackson -- they have killer chemistry . their scenes are filled with some terrific lines , but more than that , it 's about delivery ; they parry quips and insults with a good-natured banter that goes beyond making even the implausible character of samantha almost believable : it 's just plain fun watching two actors at the top of their game play off each other . no reason to turn up one 's nose at a-grade actors in b-grade movies ; i seem to recall some truckers-in-space thing years ago ... alien , was it ? the movie loses a bit of momentum towards the end when it makes a feeble pass at message , but that 's easy to shrug off -- the editing 's otherwise tight and the pace is just what it should be , fast with breathing spots . the special effects work . because the film 's pretty retro in terms of plot & setting it generally has n't dated much , and the buddy-twist here is a much-needed change from the usual guyfests . last , the soundtrack is excellent , i 'm always amazed when a wise choice can bring something like she 's not there back from the dead . the only shame is that the album soundtrack lacks a lot of the best selections from the film , which demonstrates much taste in southern blues . finally : ok , yes . that thing with the shot glass ? too cool
ok , so ks has a similar voice to conor oberst . so what ? what 's the big deal ? blink-182 , good charlotte , and simple plan all sound exactly the same , and they 're getting five star reviews ! just lay off of it . and , even though their voices are similar , their music is much different , they sound different . they even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and ... well , that 's it . but this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band . and , maybe his voice naturally sounds like conor oberst 's . you ca n't help that . an angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds . i pop this cd in from time to time , not my favorite , but it 's very good ! so , just give this a chance without thinking it as a bright eyes rip-off , because that 's just what it 's not
i do n't write reviews ; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me . still ... '' amos lee '' stands the test of time . how long ago did i buy this cd ? i played it to death when i got it . had to go see amos when he came to town . talked my sister into going with me . `` you 'll like him , he 's low key , kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music . '' recently popped the cd back into the cd player . it 's still soooo good for relaxing , slowing down , chillin ' . my daughter surprised me when the music started . she said , `` is this amos lee ? ! ! i love this cd . '' and she 's a <NUM> year old ( self-described ) orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock : emo . if you have n't gotten this one yet , but you 've been thinking about it , stop waiting . it 's intellingent , sophisticated , difficult to classify , and wo n't get old
the lexicon is the most comprehensive source of rand writings and ideas . however , it is not all inclusive : she has spoken about parenting , child-rearing , and children . one example is a radio interview that she did discussing romantic literature which led to a discussion on children and parenting . also , look at & quot ; objectivist epistimology & quot ; where she discusses how a child develops cognitively ( which would have connections with raising a child )
while this album does n't reach the maturity and beauty of records such as beautiful creature nor does it flaunt the naivety of masterpieces such as hey babe nor does it reach the pop mastery of her recent some girls effort , it delicately floats among the three creating a brief , unwavering expression of true music . made from base emotions and raw vocals and instruments , this is quite a unique juliana record indeed . has juliana become a bit too jaded for her own good ? maybe , but who cares , there are some truly catchy songs on here , such as stay awake . all these angry , grungy , alternative mainstream chick rockers you are hearing now on top <NUM> countdowns across the world , were invariably influenced by this wonderful songwriter . for anyone else , i might dismiss her often childish lyrics and emotions , but she has proven that she is real the deal , endearing us with her honest feelings more than pushing us away . but these are n't the reasons i 'm telling you to listen to this album , it 's because she is still the juliana we know and love , just a little older and perhaps a little more bitter . she is still the one making us hum her songs at work , on the bus , whereever we may be . she is ornery pop music taken directly and unedited from the heart . i would have loved a few more `` quiet '' songs , but i 'm sure she 'll take care of that on her next album -- think juliana 's pony but way better , all the songs have a harder edge than her last few albums . with each new listen , made in china becomes that much better , revealing a definite evolution of her one-of-a-kind sound . if this is your first time with her , then go back and listen to the beginning ( blake babies on up ) and you can experience an artist that is rewarding and refreshing to listen to
i love this book . i enthusiastically recommend it to everyon
supergrass ' i should coco is a landmark acheivement . the thought that mere teenagers could recreate an energy not felt since the birth of punk in the late 70s is astounding . supergrass deliver great track after great track almost through the entire album , each one filled with a youthful energy and an appropriate goofiness that is so lacking in the world of music . the frontman of the band , gaz coombs , has written enough infectious songs on this one effort alone to qualify him as one of the great pop writers of all time . only during maybe one or two tracks does the album slow a bit . it effects the final result of the album but it does n't kill it ( the slow tracks are just as good as the rest ) . it 's amazing to think how short-lived supergrass ' fame was when listening to this fine album and one can only hope that these unsung artists will rise to the top once more
gave to husband as a gift and he is enjoying this story from baseball
i wo n't wax rhapsodically about ritchie vs steve , but instead i will just rate the dang dvd . the musical direction is great . this compilation of tracks recorded at historic montreux in '96 and '00 is just fantastic . the sound quality is better than most systems are capable of , so you 'll probably get the best sound your equipment can give . i own purples australia '99 as well as scandinavian nights , new live and rare , and the come hell or high water reunion tour with blackmore . montreux is in the top two , and i have enjoyed it almost every night since it arrived last month . paice , morse , lord , glover and gillan mesh perfectly [ as always ] and obviously have a great time playing together . they joke around occasionally , and theres a few surprizes that spontaneously erupt on stage [ sooo , thats 'funky claude ' eh ? hmmm ] . this dp line-up clicks extremely well together , and it shows [ i ca n't believe i am the only one that noticed gillan giving blackmore the `` finger '' at the end of 'paint it black ' on the high water dvd . if you got it - watch the last second of that track .. boing ! up goes the 'bird ' at ritchie , who should have gotten a butt kickin instead of just the finger ] . if you are a purple fan , or just a music lover who enjoys those nice long live instrumental riffs of great rock & roll that highlight not only the guitarist but all facets of the bands talents , buy this disk . these guys blend better than tequila and lime . theres plenty of deep-cut material on it i 'd bet money you have not heard before and that in itself is reason enough
i have always enjoyed the older books by larry niven , and recently began collecting them again . i love the entire integral universe he has created and the stories are excellent . i would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a realtively quick sci-fi read for the summer

i really enjoyed this book . i found myself empathizing with darcy from the middle of the book until the end . a great read
i find rousseau especially creative in the way he describes how inequality progressed from the time the first humans made contact . he makes a good case for the solitary life . i think rousseau believes it is destructive whenever humans come together in groups . governments were formed to protect the weaker from the stronger or as rousseau thinks to actually protect the rich from the poor . this is an outstanding book . it will haunt you
london is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes . his writing is beautiful , poignant , and powerful , yet also somber , morose , and infinitely real . this is n't a story to read when you are depressed . although the call of the wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog 's story , it contains as much truth and reality of man 's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life 's work of many other respected authors . the story he tells is stark and real , and as such , it is not pretty picture he paints , nor an elevating story he writes . as an animal lover , i found parts of this story heartbreaking from buck 's removal from the civilized southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard , weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes . even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled 's traces around him . good-spirited curly never had a chance , while dave 's story is only made bearable because of his brave , undying spirit . even spitz , the harsh taskmaster , has to be pitied , despite his harsh nature , for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches . buck 's travails are long and hard , but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero , despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him . buck not only conquers the weather , the harshness of the men , the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with , he thrives . hopes for redemption with john thornton are dashed in the end , and that 's when buck finally gives in fully to `` the call of the wild , '' becoming a creature of nature only . while this is a sad ending , the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at buck 's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed
in the 1990s , the country music began to go through some transitions . country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music . as a result , the sound started to change . one artist that led this transition was faith hill . faith hill had previously released two albums , but it was her <NUM> breakthrough album `` faith '' that helped her break into mainstream music . surprisingly , while `` faith '' did cross-over into the mainstream , there still is a strong country element on this album . by no means do i consider myself a country music expert . the nice thing about `` faith '' is that i believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into country music , but can appreciate many of the elements country music can bring to the table . while `` faith '' could be directed to a more casual fan like myself , i think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the country music genre . faith hill brings an interesting formula to this album . faith 's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist . since she is focused on vocals , she is dependent on a solid cast of characters ( musicians and songwriters ) to support her effort . on `` faith '' , this does n't appear to be a problem . she is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with . given this solid infrastructure , faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product . the interesting twist to this formula is that faith hill is a co-producer on all <NUM> songs . therefore she just is n't a `` vocalist for hire '' . she ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound . this is why `` faith '' is a solid collection . `` this kiss '' was the song that made faith hill a household name on the mainstream music scene . this was also the song that was my first introduction to faith hill . in <NUM> , i first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away . one reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a `` pop '' song . however , there is a true country element to this song - complete with steel guitar and fiddle ( played by glen duncan ) . this instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor . the song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as `` it 's a centrifugal motion ; it 's perpetual bliss ; it 's that pivotal moment '' . the vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace ( with little rests between the words ) and that also contribute to the unique flavor . this song features some great background vocals by chris rodriguez ( who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album ) and beth nielson chapman ( who is a co-writer for this song ) . at first , upon purchasing `` faith '' , i expected it would basically be `` this kiss '' and not much else . however , after my first listen to this collection - i realized that this was not the case . there were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection . the second song `` you give me love '' is also pretty catchy . this has much more of a country element on this song . this song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more fiddle by glen duncan . although not as catchy a song , `` let me let go '' is worth mentioning . the highlight of this particular song is background vocals by vince gill . gill is a master in the domain of steering country music toward the mainstream , but not abandoning the country music element . this song clearly has a country element and it works . this song also features a string section of viola players . the country music element is alive and well in the song `` better days '' . this song was co-written by former fleetwood mac vocalist billy burnette . this song also features duncan 's fiddle . the country music element is also present in the song `` my wild frontier '' . this is a powerful and sad song about a woman , who with her family moves into the canadian prairie . tragedy then strikes when the woman 's baby son dies in his sleep . this song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by faith . the best song on the album is `` the secret of life '' . this song was co-written by gretchen peters , who is a songwriter that worked with bryan adams on `` on a day like today '' and his `` unplugged '' album . the song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what `` the secret of life is '' . no loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by duncan . simple lyrics like `` the secret of life is in sam 's martini '' ( sam is a character that is referred to in the song ) or `` the secret of life is a good cup of coffee '' give this song a very special quality . two other country element songs are that are solid are `` just to hear you say that you love me '' and `` the hard way '' . in `` just to hear you say you love me '' , faith does a terrific duet with her husband tim mcgraw . as for `` the hard way '' , this is very powerful song ( more great fiddle ) and is best described by the lyrics `` i keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way '' . finally , `` me '' is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is . on a side note , sheryl crow is a co-writer of `` somebody stand by me '' . not a great song , but worth mentioning . all of the lyrics , studio musicians , songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes . this album should appeal to country music and mainstream fans . highly recommended
fromm is one of the classics - along with freud , jung , adler . he studied psychology , philosophy and sociology , received his phd at the age of <NUM> , became interested in zen buddhism at the age of <NUM> . one of the true geniuses . this book was written in <NUM> . here fromm discusses love from philosophical , psychological and sociological point of view . what love is and is n't ? in what ways do we misconceive love ? is love indeed an art ? why do we need it ? what is the difference between love of a mother and a father ( as archetypes ) ? he discusses different kinds of love : brotherly love ( love to any other human being - just because he is a human being ) , erotic love , self-love , love to god . the last half of the book is dedicated to how love disintegrates in modern western society and how we can practice love .
it got inside my head ... and has not left after a year
bill evans is a musician you never tire of listening to . he has the ability to play a tune freshly , every time . this recording is , in my opinion , his finest . the first date after the untimely death of scott lafaro , this album is beautiful , melodic and haunting . every tune is played with typical evans genius , but on this session he seems to be expressing his musical ideas with even more flavor and emotion . the first cut is the most expressive and emotive i have ever heard in the trio setting . i am sure it was dedicated to lafaro , even though it supposedly is an anagram for the producer of the date , orrin keepnews . evans expresses his passion , joy and grief for his young bassist in every note and the result is , to my mind , stunning . i love chuck israels ' bass lines and the chords evans plays quietly over the bass solo are beautiful and ephemeral . every tune on this cd is wonderful , the playing of everyone is at such a high level of creativity that this music will live on forever . this is a ca n't miss choice if you like piano music
i actually listened to the audio book read by the author . she does a great job as a reader which usually is n't the case when an author reads her own work , in my experience . it 's great to read about someone 's lovely and loving childhood for a change , and it 's not boring ! far from it . i laughed out loud , and cried from being moved by beauty instead of tragedy . do n't miss this one
thoreau said `` the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation . '' while this may be true of some , others are not so quiet . caouette has unleashed a tidal wave of agony and angst , at times a shill scream of adolescent suffering , at other times a low moan of early adult-onset life affliction . truly , many of us know the feeling of wanting to explode and fill the void with the screech of our own inner turmoils , but lack the voice , the means , the mechanisms . for want of a method we seeth silently , voiceless , castrated , invisible . we want to be known and loved and understood and instead we stammer and stutter and fall silent . we pack in our caring and seal our emotions and vulnerabilities behind high walls of rationality and apathy . or we scribble in diaries or blogs and our hidden solitary torture goes wholly unnoticed . caouette has commendably captured in video and audio snippets , in stills and captions , a glimpse into the troubled past that haunts and harasses him . he has undertake a photo collage of his own life experience , himself as the subject matter and the material . i can not know how much he left on the cutting room floor , what he felt necessary or desireable to expunge , but he seems to have faced it all with remarkable candor and vulnerability . he survived a rural southern upbringing , a father-less household , poverty , a love of film , and homosexuality . to that potent melange , he added mental illness , abandonment , foster care , pcp , physical and sexual abuse . i can not say that i understand his life even after viewing it or that i can even relate to some of the events that shaped him . but through his art i feel that i can say i know a little of him and i can say that i empathize with his pain . i will never walk a mile in his shoes , but i do n't think i have to in order to care about the tribulations and fate of another human being . it is his candor and vulnerability , his willingness to expose the deepest parts of his own psyche and say `` here i am , look at me . '' that makes me care about him . that gives me a reason to watch and wonder , how did he turn out ? seeing the first half of the project , one would be forgiven for thinking `` this will end badly . '' that one of these stark text captions will announce his successful suicide and provide that closing parenthesis to his life : jonathan caouette ( <NUM> - 200x ) . ultimately , i think he redeemed himself and perhaps transcended his lot in life . what i saw as the film continued was a man coming to terms with himself and his past . a man demonstrating that he is capable of finding love and connecting with others . a man who did not harbor resentments for the wrongs done to him and his mother , did not harbor a grudge toward his father or grandparents for abandonment or abuse . rather , i saw a thoughtful , emotional , caring man , a creative artist , a loving partner and a devoted son . his journey is not yet complete , but as the film concluded , i felt a compassion and a sense of optimism , for not just jonathan , but for all of us .
i love this movie and have for years . i bought the dvd because i think that my video is nearly worn out
kris and her father get into a car accident and she ends up loosing her father . kris and her friends go to belgium to clean out her fathers study where he had been working on his latest manuscript . while there the caretakes talks them into taking a tour of the mine . while in the mine the group learns the story of andries martines who was a murderer and also into black magic . however as it turns out andries spirit was not laid to rest . i do n't want to give away too much of it but i really enjoyed it . very well done all around and creepy which is a big plus considering some the stinkers i have seen lately
i enjoyed this book . a portrait of an actress trying to search for her place in the world after witnessing the fall of the twin towers . great details for those familiar with the locations and people that make downtown new york its own universe . some names are changed to protect the innocent , but even if you have never ventured south of times square , i believe you will be able to enjoy these characters and their attempts to `` make it '' . a quick read ( i finished this in one sitting and i am not a fast reader ) , fast paced , smart and funny . i am looking forward to reading other books by this author
if you watch -- and listen to -- enough movies , you can almost name the composer of certain scores , they 're so similar . john barry 's scores to & quot ; dances with wolves , & quot ; & quot ; out of africa , & quot ; and & quot ; somewhere in time & quot ; ( except for the rachmaninoff ) , are like that . james horner 's scores are a little better differentiated . but the two best , able to write evocative scores that capture the essence of the film 's story and make us feel it -- without leaving us thinking we 've heard this before -- are jerry goldsmith ( e.g. , & quot ; the sandpebbles & quot ; ) and john williams . here , like goldsmith 's score to & quot ; the wind and the lion , & quot ; williams is able to take a truly exotic motif -- the musical forms of west africa -- and mix it with truly american , if a little copland-esqe-sounding , music . and that 's the whole idea . people were violently ripped from their homes and transported to , for them , a place no less alien and bizarre than africa was to white europeans and americans . and yet the united states was a place that declared & quot ; all men are created equal. & quot ; the contemplative , high-principle-sounding music to & quot ; mr. adams takes the case , & quot ; is as stirring as the exotic & quot ; dry your tears , afrika , & quot ; but in a completely different way . that john williams is able to do that in score after score is what makes him one of the all-time greatest in a genre that has n't been around all that long . my only wish is that film score composers would more often produce true , symphonic suites from their film scores that can be played by orchestras as stand-alone , concert pieces . i hope this music becomes such a suite . like the subject matter of the movie -- the eternal human quest for freedom and equality -- it would become timeless
i 've seen ( heard -- whatever ) klute spin a few times , and he is unbelievable . mostly dark , hard stuff ( which is my taste -- see his breakbeat science exercise mix cd ) . this orginally produced music by him brings out some different tastes i did n't realize he had in him . i 'm not going to get into his `` collage of genres '' cd ( # <NUM> ) [ revision -- i actually wrote this review before i had given disc # <NUM> a full listen . there is some really good sh * * here -- especially for you breaks/ party dj 's -- that would probably never think to look in a d & b 's producers direction for such trax -- check `` artificial sense '' and `` overchoice '' ] , but cd # <NUM> has a lot of flavours on it . i 'm not a big <NUM> step fan , but `` part of me '' is completely addicting . `` problem reaction '' and `` tacky '' -- ( `` ether '' falls somewhere in between <NUM> step & jungle ) -- are typical klute standouts , and only he and high conrast could even get me in the <NUM> stepping groove ( if you can call it that ) . according to silly people who do n't have a clue about music , d & b is fading as a genre . but w/ more producers like klute ( and high contrast ) around , it will be here to stay .
these books are great for kids who are reading early chapter books -- they 're not terribly long , but they 're quite creative . my son loves them
we were very pleased with our books . they were for christmas.and we recieved them in plenty of time . im sure we will do business with amazon again . thank you so much .. and happy new year
i first borrowed this book from the library . i read it and had to own it . i do not ever purchase books , i borrow them . the writting is amazing . that is the only word that even comes close to describing the experience of reading this book . the feelings i felt while reading traveling light went from one end of the spectrum to the other . awesome
i met ms. holt in ... ( basis for her fictional town of moon ) . she is like her characters ... down-to-earth , witty , and honest . as a twenty-seven year old teacher , i read this novel for three reasons : its setting ... i 've read her other novels and loved them , and to find new reading material for recommendation to my students . i was not disappointed . jaynell and her family are easy to identify with , easy to follow , and easy to love . the story line is not difficult and the messages ring all too true ! pick this one up , you wo n't stop 'till the end
this movie was packed full of action and very well configured fighting . jet li did a wonderful acting and fighting job as always
i became a first time homeowner <NUM> years ago and i did n't know anything about gardening . my friend recommended this book to me and it has been very educational . it is the only book i reference when planning my garden . this book is broken down by topic : perennials , annuals , trees , shrubs , etc . it explains the differences between all the flowers and what environment is best for each flower/shrub/vine/trees . the pictures are great ! there are pictures of almost every plant he describes . i have able to choose my flowers to plant each season from the book so when i go to the nursery i know exactly what i need
art of chill <NUM> is an amazing divergence from traditional relaxation cd 's . whether i 'm looking for background sounds while reading , entering the relaxation zone or focusing on positive feelings , this <NUM> cd collection has become a favorite of mine . i 'm a musician and have not been a big fan of electronically created drum or melodic sounds , but when i heard this cd i was attracted to all of the tracks immediately . it 's not too often that you can find an artist/cd where everthing on it has an impact on you . while playing the cd 's working in my office i 'm able to focus my concentration and satisfy my never ending craving for new and creative sounds . if i want to relax and calm myself i 've been able to do so with the sounds on this cd set . jon hopkins is a clever musician and taps into some captivating rythyms , chord progressions , melodies and lyrics . i enjoy listening to this cd as it is my number one relaxation technique on plastic . very captivating , and you 'll definetly chill ; do n't pass it up .
after watching the film , `` finding neverland '' , i was curious to learn more about the fates of the <NUM> boys orphaned in the story . although barrie did not gain custody of the boys , he did maintain a strong presence in their lifes . in fact , he did much more than just keep an eye on them over the years . he showered them with gifts ; traveled with them ; and of course , financially helped them . he seemed particularly obsessed with the older boy , george . barrie loved to photograph all of the boys and some of the photos included in this book show the children naked . was barrie a pedophile of sorts ? none of the boys ever accused him of such . and barrie 's love and concern for the boys did not end when they became men who were tall enough to tower over the diminutive playwright . this is a comprehensive look at barrie 's life without passing any judgement . that is left to the reader . and after reading this book , i have to say that i 'm still unable to figure the man out . he is an enigma . there are tons of photographs - one or two on just about every page . original correspondence and notes from barrie 's diary/journals add further insight . a fascinating , and sometimes tragic look back in time
she-ra returns to dvd in style with the second half of season one . here we see fan faves such as huntara , horde prime takes a holiday , anchors aloft parts <NUM> and <NUM> , and loo-kee lends a hand . plus many other episodes including yet more appearances by her twin brother he-man as well as the episodes a talent for trouble and the greatest magic featuring orko , and of shadows and skulls which features skeletor . two more amazing art cards accompany the set as well as the second part of the stories of she-ra documentary . you cant go wrong if you buy this set . continue the story of she-ra and support filmation 's continuance of the he-man and she-ra properties . let the power return for the honor of greyskull , buy season one part two
this book is a great book ! i have read it many times , and every time , i find something new . this book is about a mature <NUM> year old girl , libby , who lives with her parents and her brother in a tralier . when things get hard , her mom leaves them and they can no longer afford to keep the tralier . they are forced to move into a homeless shelter . libby keeps up hope for her dad and brother about getting a new tralier & quot ; when the leaves change color in october & quot ; she finds ways to help out her dad finacially . it is a great story about a family sticking together through good and bad times . this is one of the best books i 've ever read
dan zanes has written catchy music , and the videos are really fun . my <NUM> year old toddler really enjoys them when he sees them on disney , so we bought this dvd . while the concert portion is n't that great ( he got bored ) , the videos were for songs we 'd not seen and he will ask for `` dan zanes '' so we 'll put the dvd in and sing , dance and just have fun with it
i bought this dvd last year and when i fell off of the exercise wagon , this was relegated to a drawer in the entertainment center . after doing a kathy smith weight lifting routine last night , i picked this back up to stretch right before bed with the pm routine . i 'm <NUM> , and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life . but even i needed improvement , and along with cardio and weight training , i 've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine . my feet hurt from high heels . my quads are too weak , and i fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger . the stretches in the pm section for the quads and feet ( love the massage ! ) were so good that for those reasons alone i 'm committing to doing this every night to get the day 's kinks out . lewis instructs you to start a stretch , contract a muscle , and then deepen the stretch . i have n't seen this technique anywhere else , and i think it 's a wonderful method for improving flexibility . unfortunately , it 's only noon right now and nowhere near bedtime . i 'm already looking forward to doing this one again . one day i 'll get up early enough to do the am routine ....
well i am very surprized , frankly , that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet , so i will ! this dvd was released in may <NUM> and is the first real taste of robben ford live since his excellent live set in baden-baden germany in the 1990s as part of the `` ohne filter-musik pur '' series-and they are all great ! in this paris set in <NUM> robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer , super bassist ( check his solo in `` help the poor '' ) and , for the first time , keyboards . i ca n't praise this performance enough . robben exhibits his style masterfully , without a lot of show , and demonstrates how he has successfully combined jazz ( especially jazz sax ) with chicago electric blues . ford started around the bay area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the `` charles ford band '' ( named for his dad ) during the end of the blues power revival of the 1ate 1960s . he got to play with charlie mussellwhite and then miles davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops . i love the part in the interview ( a great bonus feature ! ) where he said miles liked him when he played his own stuff , his own way ... not what miles had originally thought he 'd play . well this dvd is well produced , has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent , as you would expect from the inaukstik people ! the opening track `` prison of love '' one of fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance . it 's a cool jazz-blues . the top selection of the dvd is `` help the poor '' from his most famous and acclaimed recording `` talk to your daughter '' . this version is great the the solos are as good as you 'll ever hear from anyone ! i always thought this and `` born under a bad sign '' were ford 's greatest songs ever ! `` chevrolet '' is a remake of a donovan song `` hey gyp '' ( ford is a master of re-doing old tunes , especially blues , in a new groove and extending them ! ) this song was done by the animals as well in the late 1960s . it is great ! `` start it up '' is a ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster , which he plays through most of this set-that 's also unusual . his version of mike mcdonald 's `` nothing to nobody '' is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure . the minor key blues offering `` moonchild blues '' is perhaps the second greatest tune on the dvd , it sounds very close to the howlin ' wolf classic `` who 's been talking '' ! you just want to keep on playing it ! i highly recommend this dvd . it is the best new blues inspired dvd of <NUM> and a great addition to anyone 's collection . if you only get one robben ford dvd , this is it ! great product and interesting bonus interview

the truth hurts . while it hurts , it is also much harder to swallow . these are issues that require consumption by everyone
this film is the best review on record of what happened in <NUM> . the reviews that denigrate it do n't answer the charges , they just distract . the facts and the evidence show that israel attacked a u.s. ship in international waters and tried to sink it , for whatever motive . some feel that it might have been because israel , our `` gallant little ally '' , was executing pow 's because they did n't have the logistics to care for them . others feel it that they were going to sink the ship and blame it on egypt , thereby drawing us into the conflict directly on israel 's side of course . ( where have we seen this before ? ) the detractors ca n't deal with the facts and this film proves israel is a murdering , traitorous , backstabbing nation whose only alligiance is to themselves .
whatever happened to the good old days where swedish music truly ruled . now , melodic death seems to be dying out in that country , with classic bands such as soilwork , in flames , and arch enemy all having changed their sounds completely . i 'm talking about the good old experimental days where everything might 've seemed risky but the price of success even greater . albums like `` slaughter of the soul '' are true masterpieces . they only come once for a band . every known melodic death band has that classic album , and for at the gates , although they are no dead , this is it . and to tell you the truth , this is actually where melodic death started , which is in no means bad . it is fresh and brutal , probably what many people resort to rather than the melodic side of the music that bands tend to release now
if there has ever been a better live album than judy at carnegie hall , i 'd like to know what it is . simply exhilarating in audio , one can only imagine what it was like to be in that audience in <NUM> . how did they manage to not spontaneously combust ? there are so many spin-tingling moments that one is hard-pressed to choose a favorite . from the subdued and sublime ballad if love were all to the raucous tributes chicago and san franciso , judy covers all the bases and hits a home run every time . even when she forgets the lyrics , as she does in you go to my head , she does it brilliantly and with charm . i 've owned this album in one form or other since i was a kid in the 1970s and i never get tired of it . even if you think you do n't like this kind of music it is an amazing experence . buy this . buy it now
there is very little not to like about the flash . a super hero , lightning speed , and evil villains . best of all , the flash appears on and off throughout the episode . this is quite a change from those cheesy super hero television series of the 1970s where we were limited to a glimpse of our hero only twice during the show : once during the first <NUM> minutes and again in the final five minutes . the flash was a natural extension of warner brothers ' success with the batman motion picture . in fact , the flash shared many of tim burton film 's elements : a darker superhero , most of the stories taking place at night , and danny elfman music . comic book loyalists were quick to point out the deviations from print , but given the choice it was better to have the flash for one reason than not at all . cbs premiered the flash during the <NUM> - <NUM> television season . as numerous reviewers have reiterated , the show was doomed to fail because of cbs programming mismanagement . the early 1990s was a time when abc , cbs , and nbc still held most of the cards as `` the networks . '' as networks they crowded their programming line up with series , sitcoms , mini-series , sporting events , and specials . the flash was often displaced from its time slot so often that fans could not keep up with it . at times it also aired at the same time as other popular shows such as the simpsons and the cosby show . contributing to the show 's demise was that the first gulf war , desert shield/desert storm , was constantly in the news and a regular source for special news reports . the show should have been awarded a second season , but cbs had zero tolerance for low ratings . a couple years later the flash probably would have found better success on fox or cw . alas , it was not to be . thus it was that i was surprised by the show when it appeared on the british satellite station sky one in <NUM> . at that time sky one was also beamed to continental europe and provided an additional , and sorely needed , english language television channel for us military personnel in germany . unfortunately i was not able to catch the whole series . by the time we added a satellite dish to our german apartment balcony the flash was only a couple episodes away from finishing its run on sky one . a couple years later i stumbled on two video cassettes of the series , the pilot episode and a `` movie '' assembled from two episodes involving the trickster , and was able to enjoy a little more of the series . the dvd set is very affordable . if your remember the series from <NUM> , now is your time to order the dvds and enjoy them at your liesur
`` the searchers '' is considered by many to be a masterpiece of both the western genre and of movies in general . it 's even on the american film institute 's top <NUM> ( # <NUM> ) . i liked the film ; it 's got a lot of good things about it , but one thing i look for in a film to really call it `` great '' is entertainment . the movie is entertaining , but a movie on that same list that 's a few notches below it ( 'unforgiven ' ) was a much better movie ; both as a film and as entertainment . anyway , i 've seen over a thousand movies and have somehow never seen a john wayne film . wayne plays ethan edwards , a former confederate soldier who shacks up with his brother and his family . after they 're all killed and his two nieces are kidnapped , ethan sets out on an obsessive quest to get them back . one of the nieces is found dead soon after and the rest of the film is about them trying to find the living one debbie ( natalie wood ) . along with him is martin pauley ( jeffrey hunter ) , a man ethan does n't really like . ethan hates indians and martin is 1/8 comanche . early in the film , you find out that ethan actualyl saved martin when his family was killed by indians and gave him to his brother and his brother 's wife . even though he seems disagreeable , it sounds like ethan 's quest in honorable enough . but , you 'd be wrong . he 's not out to save debbie , but to kill her . when people are kidnapped by the indians , they pretty much become one ... and ethan ca n't have that . the movie takes place over a long time span and there were times that , i thought , the movie seemed longer than it was . the film has beautiful cinematography though , especially when you consider that the film was released in <NUM> . john wayne 's performance is very good and , you find later , multilayered . having read about the film a little bit , i found that it inspired movies like taxi driver and even the buddy holly song `` that 'll be the day '' ( which is a line ethan frequently says ) . i should make this clear that i 'm not a huge fan of classic westerns , so that may have something to do with my view of the film . i know that certainly not everyone will agree with me about it . but i can say this . if you 're a big fan of westerns and/or john wayne . you 'll probably like this movie . grade :
mike myers is so silly , when you are in need of a laugh , austin powers is it . a good laugh is what the world is lacking today .
`` the tao can be told is not the eternal tao . '' so you see , mitchell goes about the impossible task of translating and telling us about something that ca n't be told . if you understand this , you understand why rather than a literal interpretation , he chooses instead ( and succeeds , in my opinion ) in capturing the essence . it 's hard for me to imagine anyone not liking this book but to each his own . as for me , i rate it as excellent without any qualifications
while not the best care bears show it was funny . i also liked how they were trying hard to appeal to boys as well
for the money this cd is great . some good songs , # 's:1,2,8,9,10 and the nofx song at the end is great . its definitelyworth the money . but if it were <NUM> bucks i would be so sur
i liked the other brmc albums a lot as well , but i think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever , but after a few listens it got kinda tired ... still good , but you 'd think `` oh yeah ... '' howl is the opposite . it was ok the first time i listened to it , and i kinda liked it , but it didnt really dig it 's claws into me . for that reason it did n't get pulled out of the cd wallet all that often . then i put it in one day and thought `` ya know , this is actually pretty good . '' then i started listening to it some more and thought `` man , this is really , really good ! '' guess what ? now i love it ... this is definitely a creeper cd , as in - it creeps up on you ( yeah , that was a stoner analogy . ) i think `` weight of the world '' is the best song on the cd , but `` howl '' had really grown on me too - but i do n't want to harp on the songs too much , this is an album as a whole . bands grow up and change , and i 'm glad to see that brmc has done it , and done it well . they have n't lost their muse or gotten `` softer '' just to try something different -- they 've grown and changed and their music shows it . i remember my freshman year in college when achtung baby came out and there were people saying stuff like `` boycott u2 cuz they 're sellouts ! '' - not realizing that ab would be looked at as probably the most insightful , clever , and musically interesting album of their catalog . that 's what the backlash to howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate . yeah , people may fear change , and admittedly , some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process ( chris gaines , anyone ... ) but brmc has actually grown , and if you liked their first <NUM> cd 's i 'd say give this one a shot . it 's really good - and i 'm proud of 'em for making it .
we enjoy all wc comedies . the packaging and the quality are amazing . we laughed often and the `` you 're telling me '' was especially funny
michael block is an extraordinary educator and this text demonstrates his teaching abilities and his knowledge of implant dentistry . he sits on the education committees of several scientific academies for a reason . there is content appropriate for all dentists , not just oral surgeons . the text is easy to navigate through , there are ample references that will be helpful to students and educators alike , and the images , etc . are helpful towards clarifying concepts in implant dentistry . it is a must for every advanced implant surgeon and cutting edge restorative clinician
i have had this album on cassette tape for some time , and decided to update to cd format . needless to say , if it was n't a fine album , i would n't have pursued this title cd . fabulous as ever
devildriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album `` the fury of our maker 's hand '' . this cd is excellent . the guitar riffs are amazing , and dez fafara is definitely unique with his vocals . the tracks vary in speed , whether it 's the up-tempo of `` hold back the day '' or `` driving down the darkness '' , or the doomy `` sin and sacrifice '' . `` grinf * * ked '' is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem . recommended if you like it heavy . p.s . this is n't `` brutal death metal '' . brutal death metal is stuff like devourment , saprogenic , gorgasm , etc . just so that you know .
i 'm no longer as ignorant about public policy and processes and the government as i was when i started listening to the likes of `` suffer '' and `` against the grain '' . now i do n't protest things or show support by voicing my opinions for all to hear or through public action like a pretentious prick , but now i do it by voting and posting crappy reviews . and i do n't totally agree with bad religion like i used to , but , i got ta hand it to them , they definitely churned out another great album and i love the songs . `` beyond electric dreams '' , `` los angeles is burning '' , `` sinister rouge '' , `` god 's love '' are all great . i say , you do n't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot , but show the love for the band and their musical talent
if you like huey lewis , do n't hesitate to pick up this disc . it has a nice mixture of hits from the 80s , 90s , and today . you can tell the upper end of huey 's voice has suffered a little bit with age . but otherwise he and his ( now ) larger band sound great . i especially enjoyed the new arrangement of `` do you believe in love . '' as somebody who grew up during the 80s ( when huey was at his peak ) , this disc has been a real treat to listen to .
to begin with , i wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol ! that said , this is a rare case ( the 1st of its kind ? ) of a movie being better than the play it was based on . the general framework was of course the same , but in the play judy holliday 's part was taken by josephine hull , a very funny little old lady ( who also scored both on bway and on the screen in `` harvey '' and `` arsenic and old lace , '' to name the only <NUM> that i know of ) , and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges , it blossomed in the film . one problem , there simply were no witty lines , either in the play or the movie . this is odd for kaufman ( though the play was produced in <NUM> , very late in his career ) , but about par for burrows ( early in his career ) . but still it was clever and interesting , the play had more structure than the movie ( typical of kaufman ) , but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play , which surprised me very much and made me wonder about kaufman . also the flick left out all the naughty words which i 'm sure hull barked out with delicious abandon ! ( note : kaufman co-wrote the play , burrows adapted it for the screen . ) this i think was more a sit-com than an actually witty kaufman comedy . and finally , judy holliday did not play a `` dumb blonde '' ! she only did that in `` born yesterday .
it 's good but it could be better . however , all the the new story lines are n't needed , it just shows how bad of a writer you really are when you must change story lines to give your writing team or person an edge . i still gave them <NUM> star
i enjoyed this workout . i love yoga for its awakening of the muscles and concentrated breathing , but it was my first experience with pilates . i enjoyed the mix because it gave my abs and biceps a workout , you get to reward your muscles w/nice stretches , and the <NUM> minutes went by quickly . i feel the pilates and yoga were blended well in this workout - great for beginner in either
the book i read was championship ball , by clair bee . championship ball is about a high school basketball player named chip . chip is an extremely good athlete and is a starting basketball player for his high school . everything was going great until something happened that would change chips life forever . during a basketball game chip got tripped up and hit the ground hard . as chip was writhing in pain , the team trainer came out to assist him . as it turned out chip had fractured his ankle in several places . it was pretty bad which would mean that he would have to watch the games from the team bench for the rest of the year most likely . as his team goes on without him , they are doing quite well . they are making a championship run , and they are doing quite well , and they eventually get there . before the big championship game , chip was begging his coach to let him play . chip 's coach is not sure if chip is ready to play just yet , but chip is by far the best athlete on the team . will chip get to play in the big game , or will he have to spend yet another game spectating from the bench . i really enjoyed the book because it is very suspenseful , and it is hard to put down . it is suspenseful because throughout the book the author does not tell you chips condition in its entirety , and whether or not he will get to play in the up coming games . there was on thing that i did not like about the book and that is the repetitiveness . it seemed like every time a big game was about to unfold , the same thing happened on the court . also every time chip asked his coach to play , he always said no , so you kind of almost expect it . my strongest reason for recommending this book is that it is very well put together . also if you are into sports or you like suspense and action , then you will probably love this book because it has all of these aspects .
jennifer love hewitt is clearly not audrey hepburn , she does n't even come close , but , i will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-tv-movie . it takes us from audrey 's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of breakfast at tiffany 's . it really is a pleasant film to watch . although the script can be slow at times , i feel that it honors audrey 's memory . even her son approved of this biography . ultimately , i 'd like to say to those who bash ms. hewitt for starring in this bio-pic , i 'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise . i give this movie four stars because of emmy rossum 's incredible talents . i wish her and ms. hewitt many more successes
this movie is awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! when future generations use this movie as their blueprint for living , they will recognize the untold wondrosity of roger and jp 's relationship , the acting debuts of matthew mcaughany and adrien brody , and a sparkling star turn by delmot mulroney as the deadbeat dad . not to mention noted thespians tony danza and danny glover ! ! ! the following are some sparkling lines of dialogue . `` it could happen ! ! ! '' -- -stated <NUM> different times `` it 's god 's thumbnail ! ! ! '' -- jp `` the footprints of an angel are love ! ! ! '' -- -maggie `` uhm , david , where are the nachos ? ? ? i 'm saving them for later ! ! ! '' -- -jp and davi
this is a fascinating , entertaining , short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven . surprisingly , they actually seem to prefer hell . this is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like . it 's about people like us , and our choices , and how they affect our lives as eternal beings . reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven , i found myself trying to keep track of who was the `` right '' person and who was `` wrong '' , because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way i talk ! of course , they seemed so stupid to me because i was on the heaven side of the book . but it reminded me of a quote from the movie the truman show ( paraphrased ) : `` i think what bothers you is that truman prefers his cell . '' these people lived in hell ( and that description is interesting too ) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject god in the first place . one of lewis ' easier reads , for people who find him difficult to follow
originally released in <NUM> , as this was the band 's follow-up to 'space shanties ' ( see my review ) . also even has the very same line-up , except that group founder tony hill does some vocals . just three tracks here , `` blankman cries again '' ( 8:38 ) , `` the joke '' ( 9:29 ) and the epic `` saneonymous '' ( 14:30 ) , where simon house 's violin playing is simply superb . a decent progressive/art rock piece of work here . most definitely an acquired taste . that 's for sure
i saw the movie , i knew the story , but nothing could have prepared me for this account of it all . the different parts of the whole scandal , all the involved people from rothstein to gandil , this book is full of detail . i could not put it down as i wanted to keep learning more and more about what happened and why these players corrupted the game . i started to sympathize for them even though what they did was wrong . they were being cheated by comiskey and there was no way around that . well you can read it to find out how and learn more about the scandal as it unfolds
what a player and a super teacher , to boot ( methodical and articulate ) . slide has always been a struggle for me . wish i had picked this up years ago because warren quickly demystified it for me .
there are many reasons why world war i has been labeled the great war : it was the war to end all wars in the minds of those who lived through it , who were directly and indirectly affected by it , who continue to reference it as the war with the most emotional cost . in times when wars seems to constantly queue since that inception of world war , wars spreading from ww ii , through korea , vietnam , the gulf , balkans , eastern europe , spain , africa , iraq , afghanistan , south america and on , taking a long hard look at the great war will hopefully center our attention on a past time that can be analyzed and from which we can hopefully learn . now that jay winters ' brilliant book 'sites of memory , sites of mourning : the great war in european cultural history ' is available/affordable in paperback , every household should have a copy as children grow into the years of this century . winters ' examination of the devastation of ww i and the ways in which it informed all of the arts , the architecture , the literature , films , memorials - the people of the globe - is a mighty assignment and he is more than successful in humanizing his message . this book overflows with photographs of places , faces , bodies alive and dead , paintings , sculptures , film stills - each of which drives home winters ' powerful message . sad though it may be to admit , war is a part of life on this abused planet : the more we study it the more we hopefully will reduce it . winters wants to make sure that we remember , that we read , view , walk through , see , hear , and listen to the remnants the great war left behind . this is a powerful , necessary book and should be required reading and viewing for us all . highly recommended . grady harp , august <NUM>
`` the vietnam plays , volume two , '' by david rabe , contains two plays : `` streamers '' and `` the orphan , '' together with a <NUM> afterword by the author . the book includes production information on both plays . `` streamers '' was produced and staged in <NUM> , and `` the orphan '' was first produced professionally in <NUM> . `` streamers '' looks at a group of army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to vietnam while the war is going on . rabe focuses on a group of three roommates , all junior soldiers . as these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play , rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference : race , sexual orientation , educational background , rank . early on in the play rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army ; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds . also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans . `` streamers '' is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life , but i found it to be a dense and complex text , rich in irony , that rewards careful reading . it 's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension , lust , anxiety , anger , and violence . particularly piercing is rabe 's look at the intersection of verbal `` violence '' and physical violence . i found `` the orphan '' far less interesting than its companion piece . in it rabe melds ancient greek lore with late-20th century american concerns . although the play has some strong moments , overall i felt it lacked effectiveness . i felt that rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the trojan and vietnam wars to shed light on each other . nevertheless , the presence of `` streamers '' in this volume makes the book well worth owning , especially for those with an interest in the literature of war . recommended companion text for `` streamers '' : `` a sense of honor , '' a novel by james webb
a lot of people really freaked out when dylan became a born again christian . i remember reading that he appeared on saturday night live in <NUM> right around the time this album got released , and that the cast and staff were terrified of his christianity . i find their paranoia silly . much of dylan 's work dealt with god and religious & spiritual issues anyway , here it was just made more explicit . this is one of dylan 's best albums . his voice is filled with passion , and these songs are excellent . all of these songs still hold true today . slow train , got ta serve somebody , precious angel , and when you gon na wake up ? are my favorites here . there is n't one wasted song on the whole album . even if you 're not religious , you can listen to this . this is a great spiritual record . it is n't overly preachy , and it is n't sanctimonious . it 's just really sincere , like all great art . dylan rules ...
perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done . mr. maxwell 's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable . mr. shaara 's novel provided a great resource and mr. maxwell gave the visual display its magic . the depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves . mr. duvall gave a performance expected of his talents . mr. lang provided the quintessential `` stonewall '' in all his intense humanity and passion in faith . for the lover of history , the detail is exceptional . it may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time , this is the film where you can . admirers of `` stonewall '' will especially appreciate this film . those unfamiliar with `` stonewall '' will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man . his intensity still shines forth more than a century later . it is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end . in addition , the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb . i had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and i am very pleased with the result that has survived in this dvd edition . it was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with stonewall .
this was regal in its presentation ! ! each bride was fun to look @ , and think about that wedding . i loved this book , one of tom tierney 's best by far ! !
this book is an adapted version of the author 's doctoral dissertation . through ethnomusicological study of a music conservatory , prof. kingsbury brought to western music scholars and lovers a widened concepts of music , music talent , and music performance . music is much more than sound structure . music is also & quot ; constructed & quot ; by its social context . comparing the book with the dissertation , the sequence of the chapters is a bit different . there are also some additions in the temple university press book version . it is a thought provoking book for ethnomusicologists , musicologists , anthropologists , and particularly western music lovers
i think daves latest effort is a winner . i love the `` urban feel '' to this cd and hope he makes more like this one . i see and hear why the single `` honey dipped '' stayed at # <NUM> for so many months ...
in my opinion this is snoop 's second best album even today , behind you guessed it , doggystyle . that said it is n't even close to being as good as doggystyle , but it is still a good album and after da game ... and the slightly dissapointing doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost . da game .... featured no limit production and loads of appearances by no limit rappers , and as a result was wack , both have been cut back here . snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for no limit top dogg , including of course dre , for the first time since doggystyle . there are also less no limit rappers ( any is too many though ) featured , but surprisingly few appearances by his old west coast homies . anyway best track is easily b * tch please , which is a classic in any era , snoop 's verses are tight but xzibit is really the star of this track , as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough . my other top tracks are buck em , just dippin ( both dre produced unsuprisingly ) , betta days , down <NUM> my nig * az and trust me . snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on snoopafella , where he basically re-tells cinderella from his perspective . most of the other tracks are at least good , and the production for the most part is tight , though the album is not without filler ( gangsta ride , in love with a thug ) . overall this is an impressive album from snoop , yes it is not doggystyle , i do n't think there ever will be another one . people have the tendency to mark snoop albums against doggystyle , rather than on their own merit unfortunately though . i 'd give it <NUM> stars , recommended
this is not just a film about teen angst altho it is that also ; extremely so . but it is more so an allegory about how wrong our middle class american culture can go and how , horrifically , the american dream can turn into a nightmare as much for the people who go on living it as well as for the titular suicides . i think james woods and kathleen turner were excellent casting choices as the parents and both roles that were so out of type and yet fit so perfect that you have to wonder who was inspired to cast them . it hurts so bad to watch this movie but you ca n't help yourself because even though you 're watching for the 5th time it still sucks you in and you really start to root for this family to pull it all together and save themselves . every time you root with all your heart ; every time
i love the way she sings and the gift of her voice touches me deep within my soul . she speaks my language
from bbc , another terrific series . as good as prime suspect , it 's about the on-going core characters - all with their own psychological quirks , strengths and weaknesses as well as the crimes they need to solve . great acting , writing . suspenseful . now waiting for series <NUM> , <NUM> & <NUM> are definately keepers
wonderful movie . wanted to buy classic westerns for the nursing home i work at and know they will love it . i watched it and it is great . thank you
to surmise , the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure . i will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot . i felt that like some of heinlein 's books , the book is plauged with politics , less science fiction , the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space , other than that , it 's all politics . same thing with citizen of the galaxy , a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein 's knowledge in law . i felt that the book could have been much better and i do n't see how it won the hugo award . conclusion : the book is a fun pass , but nothing more . do n't expect any groundbreaking plot , or jaw dropping plot twists , just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary
it has never been legal or ethical to own forms of life by patent until corporations began altering the foods we eat at the genetic level . chilling documentary . unappetizing display of greed run amok

it is a shame to learn that kopit and yeston purchased the rights to the pantom of the opera but were usurped by andrew lloyd webber as it was in the public domain in enland . otherwise , we would have this marvelous music to listen to as much as we now listen to webber 's work . in a way we are fortunate that webber 's work can be heard as well as yeston 's work as the latter was allowed to publish in the us . still , it is sad to realize that the public mainly ignores this work as they think first , that it even exists and second , that it is inferior to the webber 's work . the fact is that phantom is excellent in its own right and has great songs such as `` home '' , `` melodie de paris '' and `` who could have dreamed up you '' . i highly recommend it to anyone .
i was stationed in the balkans and thhat 's where i saw this movie for the first time . hearing about the atrocities committed in bosnia and serbia frankly disturbed me , but seeing this movie gives you a visual of what life was really like in the balkans . i recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning what life is like in a war with no sympathy for a fellow human being . these mass murders were a travesty for all , but it is important to understand the history of this hatred that serbs , croats , and muslims had for each other in order to properly put into context these countries as they stand today , slowly trying to rebuild after such a cruel devestation of their homeland as well as their human spirit
bernard roberts is someone who i 'd characterize as a master crafsman who can be relied on to give a good interpretation of the works without taking them over ( e.g . like a glenn gould ) . the result is not just good listening but its makes for a recording that 's an invaluable study aid for anyone who 's trying to learn this material . since the <NUM> are not just pieces of music but bach 's demonstration of styles and keyboard technique -- something that dr. roberts seems to understand very well -- you end up with a lot more than some cds , a plastic case and a few sleeve notes ...... if you could only figure it all out , of course
great ab workout with simple instruction ; leisa hart was my life saver with her fitmama videos , and now i am feeling so much better than i did after my first two babies , , my abs are getting toned ( the extra skin is still there , but that will take me time ) , but i can see definition that i did not have before . the sexiness of this video , and all the sexy series videos , is very real , nothing fake or cheesy , it is very professionally produced and it is getting me the results i want , i highly recommend this workout
i will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all . this is a stunning collection of the early work of the ` boys ` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives . several of the titles in the series , have until fairly recently , been considered lost forever . each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc ( again recently discovered ) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack . even for those who don ` t normally view ` silent ` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen . each disc deserves five stars for content , quality and value .
despite the fact that it was slapped with an x rating , flesh gordon is really a spoof of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s ... most notably flash gordon . in fact if you saw the old flash gordon serials you 'll really find the film funny ... the humor is basically kentucky fried movie and groove tube type camp ... funny almost `` rocky horror-esque '' lines , and over the top scenarios . - - the film is most interesting because the low budget special effects are pretty good ( the fx team seems to take up half the credits and one of them went on to direct the the hells have eyes ) , yet at the same time it is definitely a nudie of that era ... ( the flip side is that it has enough plot , content and dialogue that you could edit it all out and it would still be funny . ) in the end , i 'm really surprized that this campy cult classic is n't one of the all time movie nerd favorites ... it is genuinely funny and tasteless from the get go to the big finale ! * as a funny side note aside from a really cool and groovy tune featuring some jazzy fender rhodes , there 's an ... organ scene featuring some really nifty and gospelly hammond organ ... the guy is * really * playing the pedals and playing the chords like you rarely get to hear these days
this is a very fun album . of course `` jukebox '' makes you want to dance no matter where you are . but if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor . bent fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back . the only reason this gets <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> is because the album is pretty short . even with it being padded out with a few remixes ( which are good and appreciated ) this runs under <NUM> minutes . on the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks . do n't get me wrong , this album is worth your money , especially if you are a fan of dance/dj music . very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe
this album is probably mana 's finest work . this is basically the last album they did before they went overly pop-oriented . the album art is simple , just the band with their instruments . while other albums try to catch your eye with flashy cover art , this album may go unnoticed . however , there is n't a bad song on this disc , and it is worth every penny . the songs range from love songs , to songs about difficult life circumstances , and all the songs are sung with incredible raw emotion . the music is great , and it goes with the lyrics and voice perfectly . this is the album that shows everything mana is capable of . incredible
quammen has compiled a thoughtful and entertaining collection of his essays for the boilerplate rhino . you do n't need to be a nature buff or of a scientific mind to enjoy what he 's written . this was a bit of an impulse buy due to a bargain price , but i was pleasantly surprised . i look forward to reading more of quammen 's work
allele = top notch nu-metal/hard rock . easily one of the best rock records this year along side breaking benjamin and flyleaf . worth <NUM> bucks . buy !

i know dr. young and shelley personally . they went to school with my dad and are great people . i have been to their home and retreat center rancho del sol , and it is a great place . i also have been on the ph miracle diet for about <NUM> months now , and it works ! i have lost over <NUM> pounds since then and i have cleared up some nasty protein pools in my blood that rob found six months ago when i started the program . at first i was a bit skeptical and hesitant to go on the program , but after time i felt that it was working and it was great . the food - which is cooked by a good friend of my family 's and is also on the ph program - is excellent , and the program is great . and , those jerks that attack rob and shelley personally are nothing but low-life jerks . rob and shelley are wonderful people and great friends of mine . on their retreat to rancho del sol , they went so far out of their way to help me and all of the others on the retreat . and , when you watch rob do a live blood test , it is fascinating . he presents his findings in conferences that are followed by a great alkaline lunch . and the findings are very interesting . he bases most of his work on the work of a. bechamp , an 18th century scientist that was an understudy of louis pasture . the facts are there , and quiet fascinating . he ( rob ) is brilliant , but a bit excentric . but that is understandable considering his passion for his work . over all , this program works . i love the alternative path way to health , but do admit that western methods are needed at times . i just feel that you do n't need to `` dope up '' on px drugs at the first sigh of trouble . so i give this <NUM> stars not just for the program , but for rob and shelley as my good friends . but ... do this in moderation to other healthy lifestyles . do n't just go <NUM> percent alkaline all of the sudden . slowly work your way to that wanted ph and be moderate with other health practices . so <NUM> stars for me . the book presents it all . a great read on the ph program for weight loss ! but do not assume something until you have read the book . and forget what you might think about the program until you read the book and have a sound understanding of rob 's theory . thank you rob and shelley ! !
when i first heard this album back in <NUM> , i did not like it all . i was expecting tactical neural implant part two . however , later on in life and with a much broader palate for music i must say that i love it . it was a stroke of genius to add the layer of guitars and i love the hard edged sound which sounds like a mix between ministry , fla , die krupps and even front <NUM> . the cover is a very odd thing that does not look like anything at all and the text is not all that great . the lyrics are interesting and they make up for the not so great vocals with plenty of energy and a tremendous tallent to make cross over music . the guitar layer is amazing and add a brutal edge to an already grimm sound . fla show on this album that they can mix and match their sound and still be able to create amazing music .
spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort ( and it 's one of his top <NUM> albums ) . it has <NUM> songs , of which <NUM> are classics , <NUM> are near classics , <NUM> are good , <NUM> are ok , and <NUM> i skip . guests are few and production is great . produced by blackjack ( <NUM> songs ) , chase & bosko ( <NUM> songs each ) , ant banks and payback ( <NUM> songs each ) . it 's a shame he did n't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he 'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do . even though i 'm used to southern cali rappers from mc eiht to ice cube to cj mac , spice did it with 1990-sick to put the bay on the map of gangsta rap . the song 1990-sick ( kill ' em all ) featuring mc eiht is a strong & heavy thug'sta song about haulicinations , dirty bay is a hard classic delivered by dr.bomb from da bay , sucka ass nigga featuring g-nut is a hard ice-t like hard hitter , and of course spice has a horrorcore song called snitch killas that sounds like something of the geto boys or ice cube , this is spice 's # <NUM> album ! freddy chico 's best are * <NUM> ( featuring mc eiht ) , * <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> ( featuring kokane ) , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , * <NUM> ( featuring g-nut ) , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , * <NUM> , <NUM> ( featuring e-40 ) & <NUM> .
great movie . to date the best version out there . <NUM> disc ! it was great watching it with commentary from fans . this was just awesome . the colour and widescreem format are surperb . many special features including commentaries , interviews , trailers etc . the scramble city episode which is a special feature , which i was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary . only about four toy commercials . there are easter eggs on both discs ( old diaclone toy commercials ) . overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended
though john mayer is new to me , i have always liked the 'soft rock ' genre . i got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections , ( especially 'clarity ' ) and listening to the lyrics came later . john mayer ... easy on my ears . i 'll try another cd . i think this music could grow on me .
book # <NUM> in the in death series . in this book there is a serial killer on the loose and he is murdering people connected to roarke . eve is in a race to figure out who hired this hitman and whats the connection with roarke . there is also a visit from an old irish friend of roarkes who was thought to be dead . there is also some development in the mcnab/peabody relationship . while there are some tears shed , eve is forced to take a timeout to be a good friend to peabody . i love these books and as each one is so different , the quality is still excellent
i 've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film . i do n't think anyone can deny the power in denzel 's brilliant performance , but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned , it 's been judged harshly for it . i personally do n't know the truth behind this mans conviction , his innocence and his quilt , only he knows , but the portrait painted by this film portrays rubin ` the hurricane ' carter as a victim of a corrupt system . to me it 's a very moving film , regardless if it 's true or not , and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom . denzel delivers his finest performance here ; a well deserved oscar nomination , and proves that he is a very talented actor . i am a fan of denzel , although i 've made my concern very clear ( the fact that denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters ) , and i feel he shines here . despite the constant criticism , i feel this is a must-see film , if not for the emotional , albeit somewhat fictionalized ( or assumed is a better word since no one really knows ) , story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved . dan hedeya does a great job as the crooked ( fictional ) detective who makes it his life goal to punish rubin for a crime he committed as a child ( a crime that should never have been considered a crime ) and vicellous reon shannon does wonderfully as lesra , the young man who not only fights for rubin 's freedom but helps rubin to regain the hope and life he once had . like i said , very heartwarming and touching , and regardless of whether or not rubin was guilty or innocent , the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see
i loved the movie , but the music may even be better . my friends think so too , everybody who heard it . look , if you liked the movie 's music , and are reading the reviews to figure out if it is worth buying or not , then take my word for it , it is ! it has all kinds of tracks : mostly chilly and dark , but also some narcotic-sounding slow ones ( good for dancing ) and a few brutal ones . i really recommend it , it is one of the best cds i have . if you are feeling sad , depressed , angry or if you just had enough , this is the music to listen to . buy this , it is essential for your collection
cosmos no es un libro r√°pido , lleno de situaciones que nos ponen a pasar hojas y hojas de manera fren√©tica . cosmos es un libro acerca de la vida , de c√≥mo entendernos , de observar cada cosa como si en cada imagen , cada olor , cada movimiento encontraramos el sentido verdadero de vivir . es un libro lento pero rico en descripciones . y es cierto lo que dice la rese√±a digitial , este libro tiene su lado surrealista . no es una novela en donde pasar√°n mil cosas , las cosas pasar√°n en usted si le llega a gustar el libro .
* * * * * this short and pithy small book contains a wealth of wisdom about mastery , which is described by the author , george leonard in the introduction as `` the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult become progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice '' , a `` ... long-term , essentially goalless process ... '' this book was written in the early <NUM> 's , but its message is timeless . george leonard relates the journey of mastery to his extensive experience with aikido . essentially , the book was inspirational to me , encouraging me to be enthusiastic about perseverence , patience , and most of all , about enjoying the process of learning what i am most passionate about . mastery is seen more as a journey than a destination . chapters explore topics such as loving the plateau , dealing with change and homeostasis , getting energy for mastery , and pitfalls along the path . this book has a different perspective than others i have read . i would highly recommend it . * * * *
i am going to give the batman , season <NUM> , a rating of <NUM> stars , based primarily on the continuing improvement seen in seasons one and two with respect to certain aspects of the original batman-the animated series , but downgraded from the five star seasons one and two , due to increasing reliance on robin and batgirl . because of the obvious confusion in the series titles , i will refer to the batman animated series from the <NUM> 's as batman-the animated series and i will refer to the current one as the batman . i own and have viewed all four editions of the original <NUM> 's animated classic , batman -- the animated series and like many , at first i was somewhat put off by the batman 's new animation style . batman-the animated series was groundbreaking in many ways and had an original look and feel . nevertheless , this new version grows on you and there is much of value here , indeed , some things here are even superior to batman-the animated series . the animation style here has overtones of the japanese anime style but nowhere near as much as has been incorporated into the cartoon network 's teen titans , whose look i detest . in fact , given the tragedies of the look of the teen titans and the recent computer animations done of the fantastic four on the cartoon network , and spider-man on mtv , the batman looks traditional and sensational by comparison . furthermore , for me , the batman in batman-the animated series was drawn too much with a brawny space ghost/gothic look , inspired by frank miller and the first batman movie from <NUM> . the costume in batman-the animated series returned to the original batman costume with all dark tones , from the <NUM> 's . if you are in your <NUM> 's or <NUM> 's as i am , this is not what the batman that we grew up with looked like . the <NUM> 's batman generally was leaner and more athletic looking , and had the costume that i prefer , with the round yellow bat insignia . the batman retains this classic <NUM> 's look . the premise of the batman is that this is the batman in his early years of crimefighting , and accounting for his youth , i believe that the overall look here is more consistent with the way batman was drawn in the <NUM> 's by adams , giordano , rogers and others , perhaps in order to fit more with the new batman of the movie , batman begins . at least in the first two seasons of the batman , this batman is both a loner who works by himself , and a vigilante sought by the police . i find this more realistic than having , as in batman-the animated series , the police essentially deputize batman and having batman fight crime with child sidekicks -- although robin and batgirl are to come in this series as well . the other thing that i am beginning to really like about this series is the fresh look at many of the villains that it is taking . the joker is still recognizably the joker -- i asked my three-year-old sons to verify this -- but he has a different and bizarre look . the same is truth for many of the other stalwarts : the riddler , the penguin , poison ivy , catwoman , etc . like its predecessor , the batman continues with the annoying trait of far too many joker episodes -- really , ca n't they improve security at arkham asylum at all ? -- as well as too many of the other before-mentioned villains who are beginning to become a bit tired . i would prefer to see more of the lesser-used villains like ras and the scarecrow . it does , however , have some excellent episodes involving killer croc , man-bat , and solomon grundy and another involving the bane defeat of batman . hopefully , we will continue to see more of these lesser known but more interesting opponents . one thing that i have never really understood about dc is their general refusal to use famous comic book story arcs in their movies and cartoons . when it is done , as with the ras story from batman-the animated series , the results can be excellent . marvel does this much more often , to great success but dc seems to almost always try new and inferior stories . overall , i find the batman less stilted and more in line with the classic dc comics batman of the <NUM> 's , in terms of tone , darkness and style , compared with the more self-important , taciturn and somewhat bland batman in batman-the animated series . the reason that i only give it <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> , is that the creators are currently going down the same road as their predecessors at the animated series and that means that the episodes are incorporating more and more robin , which is arguable on the merits , and more and more of batgirl , which is not arguable on the merits and is apt to ruin the series . batgirl was never an essential part of the batman comic , unlike robin and her inclusion here is lamentable . i have heard the dc creative talent say that anytime you do a batman show , that you get two years to do it right and then the suits at warner brothers come over and start asking , `` where 's robin ? -- where 's batgirl ? -- we need the youth market . '' the first two years i would give <NUM> stars to each . time will tell where this series goes from here . in my opinion , the first two seasons of the batman were the best comic book adaptation currently going , with the possible exception of the justice league , which is now out of production . i am hoping that the future of the batman has some more famous comic book story arcs involving ras , scarecrow , or man-bat , but i fear that lots of the joker , penguin and batgirl are in the offing . time will tell . if you are a traditional batman fan , i wholeheartedly recommend seasons one and two and the third season , somewhat less
i love greg iles ! have been a fan since spandau phoenix - mortal fear is iles ' second offering and it is one of my all time favorite books . it deals with computer technology and a computer sex site - and a killer who is using it for his prey . the use of character developement is astounding and the tension is nonstop . for those who like iles , and have n't read his earlier works , this is really a must read - if you are a fan of this genre and have missed this one - you will be thrilled
i just watched this movie last night . i came across the title on someone 's myspace and being a jared leto fan i wanted to watch it . i had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting . riveting is the very least i can say about this film . it is as the amazon editorial review puts it , `` a tour through hell . '' this film makes you think . the fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but i keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ? how many people are there that actually do escape addictions ? you might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another . during the film i kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground ; some little piece of hope left . i was wrong . the film did n't depict drug use the way that i had expected to see it ; the way i had seen it depicted in countless other films . all of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure . personally i found it painful to watch . there were moments when i actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch . i think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film . the truth is that i could n't stop watching . the film put me directly in the shoes of the addict . i felt like the addicts in the film . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding . i could n't close my eyes . i want to see it again sometime . i would like to watch it with my husband . i bought the movie before i had ever watched it the first time . the film was painfully realistic , genuinely graphic , appalling and appealing at the same exact time . a must see . overall i think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection . personally it is probably one of the best movies i have ever watched . i think the acting in the movie was outstanding , the direction was genius , and the plot was amazingly horrific . all in all this is an <NUM> star film
this album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of the love fellowship choir ! i must say when i hear the work of this ensemble i am all ears because i 'm never disappointed in knowing they will always `` bring it '' ! ! god bless ! !
in <NUM> , joe jackson was tired of motown records controlling his childrens ' careers . so he moved them over to epic records . the newly christened `` jacksons '' had to prove themselves to not only cbs records , but to the world that they could produce , write , and perform their own records with plausible credibility.so instead of being controlled by henry cosby , hal davis , and to a lesser extent , berry gordy at motown , their direction was handed over by epic to philidelphia phunk-meisters kenneth gamble , and leon huff . they had a tremendous string of success , with teddy pendergrass , mfsb , harold melvin , and the blue notes , and mcfadden and whitehead to name just a few . they took the jacksons ' original songs , brought them into the studio , worked their philly majik , and out came one of the greatest soul records ever cut on wax . from start to finish , `` the jacksons '' takes you from one phunkified phunk phest top the next , starting with `` enjoy yourself '' and culminating in the phunkadelic `` style of life '' . when i was a child i heard this record , and originally thought that `` good times '' was the jackson 's remake of the theme from that tv show . but it was pure slow phunk . phunk-da-fied- , phunkalicious , or just just plain phantastic , the jackson 's epic debut is phat
i have read this book . it is an exhilarating story with jam-packed thrills and adventures .
i teach an 8th grade language arts class in rural washington state . i found our textbook to be bland and typical . i was looking for some work for my students to actually learn how to write poetry correctly . this book does this
my wife and i just returned from the john jorgenson concert in jonesborough , tn . we agreed that neither of us expects to ever hear a finer guitarist ! we bought two of his cds during intermission ( including franco-american swing ) . as much as we will enjoy listening to them for years to come , nothing will replace the rare privilege of `` seeing '' this master play . the experience ca n't be described with words . the audience even gave him a standing ovation at the intermission of his two set show ! and two more before the end of the evening 's concert . buy this cd ... you are n't likely to regret it . and check out his web site www.johnjorgenson.com to see if he is playing anywhere near you . it will be worth the drive to catch his show .
this is one of the best books on fencing writen by an american . it 's major weakness is that it often attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . the author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored . this book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers ; not a good read for beginners . a good book but kept me wanting more , for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it 's done for her . close only <NUM> of <NUM> stars
the crusaders sound great on this disc.the music & amp ; arrangements work very well all the way thru.the grooves & amp ; smoothness make this recording very complete.this group has been bad for so long
this cd is light hearted and fun
when i first heard the rosabel vocal mix at a club , i almost fainted . it was the best club remix i have ever heard . and i was so worried a domestic single would not be released , and to my relief , it was . every remix on & quot ; a different kind of love song & quot ; is awesome . you will also enjoy the remixes of & quot ; the music is no good without you & quot ; . you will not be disappointed with this cd single if your a cher fan and you love club remixes .... ! ! !
what do we think and believe about ourselves , our place in the world , and the world around us ? we have the beliefs , they influence us in more ways every day than we probably realize , but rarely take a look at what they really are . this book is an exploration into the mythology of individuals , complete with exercises and methodologies . if you really want to know and are ready to look , and as a result change and free yourself from old unconscious beliefs , this book might well be a great place to start .
i accidentally posted my review of vol . <NUM> on the vol . <NUM> site . & quot ; reader from dc & quot ; seems to have deliberately done the same even tho ' he 's attacking something from the intro to vol . <NUM> , hence my confusion . will post an actual review for vol . <NUM> once i 've read it ..
& quot ; 'introduction to fall protection ' by j. nigel ellis , is a masterpiece in the art and practices for fall protection . excellent resource packed with useful information . the great value in this book is that it simplifies an otherwise tough subject ! it will , no doubt , save many lives . how much more worth could you get than that ? & quot
wcse is perhaps liz 's most mature record both song writing & musically .... the title track is both erie & sad , & i think the standout track is `` what makes you happy '' which is very upbeat & almost dancable ! this is a great record if you like good songwriting & great structure to your pop/rock music
if your interested in a healthy diet , of any type , this book is a must . for those already or considering vegetarianism , i have not yet found anything that compares . this book focuses on the `` how to be healthy '' and leaves preaching ( in things one may or may not agree with ) aside , so it is an awesome source for everyone . omnivores and veggie/vegans ( health , ar , environmentalist or any mix ) will feel comfortable reading and reaping the benefits from this book . in depth but easy to understand explanations of basic dietary needs , info from many studies , and how to make the most of this info in one 's everyday eating habits . it takes time to explain the macronutrients ( to include protein requirements and essential amino acid intake ) , individual minerals and vitamins , essential fatty acids and more . a book that i 'm extremely pleased to have come across and to have in my library
i just love these books ! they are so cute and encouraging ! you will adore all <NUM>
this book contains valuable documentation of individuals with asperger 's or hfa , problems that arise and how many of the situations can be resolved . there are some great ideas on making worksheets and charts for the individual to track his/her own emotions . this book really helps someone to realize their potential as functioning members of society . it really gives the tools to one with asperger 's to understand and comprehend the world around them
have that friend who likes good music but doesnt know cocteau twins ? give em this one and watch the obsession fly
jane fonda is best taken on screen in small doses , and the presence of the ace funny girl lily tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside , good-girl inside dolly parton in supporting roles help this project immensely . my favorite actor in this one , however , is dabney coleman as the evil boss . there are a few excesses , including a marijuana scene which rings false for this trio of co-workers , but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours .
ivan reitman 's <NUM> mega-hit , and it 's lesser sequel , are both included in this double feature dvd gift set that long time fans of the ghostbusters should consider an absolute must own . chances are you already know the story : three bumbling scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) lose their campus jobs and go into business for themselves . only thing is , their business involves capturing and containing gross and slimy ghosts throughout new york . also featuring sigourney weaver , ernie hudson , and rick moranis ; ghostbusters ended up being a super hit which spawned an animated series , tons of toys , and a sequel five years later . ghostbusters <NUM> , while nowhere near as wonderful as the first film but still pretty fun , finds the guys back in business as a new breed of evil is about to be birthed in time for new years . although this is n't the first time both films have appeared on dvd , there 's enough special features here to make this gift set worth picking up . there 's a nice selection of deleted scenes ( nothing substancial ) , a couple featurettes , and commentary from reitman and co. , but there 's no features devoted to ghostbusters <NUM> . instead , there are two animated episodes that are linked to the two films , and there 's an exclusive scrap book included too with a nice variety of information for fans . if you 've already been double dipped by the ghostbusters on dvd , picking this up is entirely up to you . however , if you 're a fan of these films and do n't own them on dvd , pick this affordable gift set up and enjoy
most of em 's fans think that the marshall mathers lp is his best work but i beg to differ . the eminem show is his greatest album for many reasons . 1-he handled all the production except <NUM> songs ( `` business '' , `` say what u say '' , & `` my dad 's gone crazy '' ) all of which was produced by the great dr. dre , 2-he kept all guest appearances to a minimum , 3-his flow improved greatly . the best song has to be `` square dance '' , a song that show how well he rides the beat with ease . let 's hope em can put out another album that can match the intensity of the eminem show . top <NUM> songs <NUM> . square dance <NUM> . say what u say f/ dr. dre <NUM> . say goodbye hollywood <NUM> . when the music stops f/ d12 <NUM> . til i collapse f/ nate dog
this is a book you expected massie to write ..... since nicholas & alexandra was written in ( i think ) <NUM> , an update since <NUM> was critical . it gives you an idea what was being discovered in dna research and proving the bones found were who they were . its a book a romanov observer should have , or at least read to glean the information from . worth it , for sure .
the futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding . intelligence is sexy is a great song , so is tears have no name and espirit de corps is outstanding . every other song is very solid . the vocals have this vibe that no other band creates , the vocals are nearly alien in nature . if you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album . they are kind of , in a weird way , an actualized voivod for the new century
i enjoyed this dvd and the suplemental dvd as well . i give this film four stars because of the great computer graphics and the clean plot . the reality factor was taken a little too far concerning the aircraft abilities/ capabilities of that time era . still ... the film was enjoyable . i ca n't help but wish that they developed the characters more . i guess there are time restraints and such to consider . anyway , a fun movie to relax with and eat pop corn with your family ! sure beats watching yet another ho hum flesh eatting zombie spin off that seems to always be showing up ( smile )
this album showcases collin raye 's amazing tenor to the fullest . hits like `` love me , '' `` little rock , '' `` my kind of girl , '' `` not that different , '' and `` i can still feel you '' are featured on this brilliant album . raye 's vocals are well done , as is the song selection . most of the songs are ballads , raye 's specialty . if you are a fan of collin raye , then this album is a must-have .
this is an excellent soundtrack . pmg show another side of their musical journey with a more atmoshperic and emotionnal journey . if only every soundtrack were this good . one big surprise that i encountered while listenign to this album is the lack of solos , but this lack works really well , the atmosphere is what sings to you on this album unlike previous metheny albums . reccomended to fans of atmospheric and laid-back music . if you 're debating on this purchase , buy it right away , you will not regret
excellent cd .. every track worth downloading ... well excluding the intro outro things.this is how i rate each track . the only dud is do n't worry , game hardly raps at all on that track the rest are good , some are great , and some are classics ! ! ( higher , put you on the game , how we do , we ai n't , westside story ) . all in all an incredible debut album ... i 've already heard a track from games next album , the doctors advocate , and i can tell you he is not gon na have a sophmore slump .. it 's gon na be hot ! get this and some mixtaps to tide you over till november 7th . intro westside story-10/10 dreams-6/10 hate it or love it-7/10 higher-10/10 how we do-10/10 do n't need your love-5/10 church for thugs-7/10 put you on the game-10/10 start from stcratch-7/10 the documentary-6/10 runnin'-6/10 no more fun and games-8/10 we ain't-10/10 where i 'm from-8/10 special-6/10 do n't worry-4/10 like father like son-7/10 outr
comparable in quality to the bbc production in six parts starring colin firth as darcey and that was not easy to achieve . moreover the additional treats such as joe wright 's comments on his work are highly interesting

intimidating issues concerning the e-commerce revolution are resolved for small business owners when they follow tiernan 's insightful directions and explanations . my responsibility as coordinator of project entrepreneur is to assist people who wish to transition into self-employment . it is with confidence that i recommend e-tailing as the perfect companion to their e-business adventures
i first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection . from being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last i had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense . the natural world , human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole . so the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and family values rather than the workings of the human mind , though these sections are also a very good read . having read widely since , i know there is far more that needs to be understood . particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women , like myself , who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male . also , with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male . it is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species , though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male . pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters , sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them , which naturally overrides female mate choice . he is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another . in this book pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'the blank slate ' when he writes about rape . though i now know enough to be able to question points in this book , i still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone .
the brilliant director of `` run lola run '' and `` the princess and the warrior '' , tom tykwer , has directed another visually stunning , thought provoking and mystical film exploring the relationship of a man and a woman from different backgrounds who find each other and realize that a strong and potent connection exists between the two of them . as in `` the princess and the warrior , '' tykwer combines the real and the surreal to dazzling effect . the main characters , whose names are `` phillipa '' and `` fillipo '' represent opposite or opposing forces who finally become merged into one . `` phillipa '' the female character , circumvents and subverts society 's ineffectual system of laws by taking the law into her own hands , and plans to kill a drug dealer who is in cahoots with the the police . `` fillipo '' , the male character , is in direct contradistinction to phillipa in that he is a member of the police system that phillipa feels has failed her , her husband , and her students ( she is a teacher ) . after she is captured , the two find a powerful spiritual connection that transforms and bonds them forever . the roles that were established for the characters blur as fillipo breaks the laws his job symbolizes and helps phillipa escape ; and phillipa , racked with guilt over the the inncoent deaths at her hands , is ready to submit to the very same laws that failed her and set all the events in motion . the film , as it progresses , reconciles these opposing forces , and the characters ' identities and ideals literally ( they begin to look alike ) and symbollically ( they begin to both believe that there is no real justice in the world ) merge into one . the film , in addition , grows more surreal as it progresses and the bond between the two is cemented both physically and spiritually . some critics have expressed that the ending is disappointing in the way it leaves the moral aspects of the film unresolved ( phillipa escapes punishment for her crimes ) . i think they have missed the point in that the main focus of the film , as in most of tykwer 's films , is on the mystical connection of the characters . the last scene , a breathtaking piece of cinema , establishes this connection in a surreal way . phillipa herself admits that she deserves punishment for her crimes , but in a world that makes no sense , where justice and law rarely live up to their ideals , their last escape makes perfect sense
make some room on your dvd shelf next to your yankeeographys because mlb productions have a hit on their hands . they answered the <NUM> boston red sox box set with a yankee compilation that was second to none . while the red sox set included only the <NUM> world series the yankees collection includes some of the greatest world series games of the joe torre era . the red sox set is guaranteed to last <NUM> years so it should keep the sox fans happy for a long time . this set includes five complete world series games , all of which are yankee victories of course . and if that was n't enough , in addition to the complete games there are two bonus disks . as exciting as the complete games are , unfortunately it does n't include john sterling and michael kay like the yes network yankee classics do . it does include the original national broadcasts , which has commentators that feature bob costas , joe buck , tim mccarver and joe morgan . the picture could n't be sharper and it does seem to be a full featured dvd as opposed to some past releases . the full games included <NUM> game <NUM> which features jimmy leyritz leading the yanks back from a 6-0 deficit to a 8-6 extra inning triumph that tied the series at <NUM> all . the next game is another come from behind victory . the third game of the <NUM> series features the bombers beating san diego ace reliever trevor hoffman . the third complete game is another game three , this one again against the braves that features a walk off homer by chad curtis . mariano rivera took a win this time around instead of his usual save . the forth complete game dvd is a game <NUM> series ender against the mets in <NUM> , the first subway series since <NUM> . the yankees won it in the top of the ninth on a single by super sub louie sojo . mike stanton got the win in relief of andy pettitte . the loss went to former yankee farmhand al leiter . the final complete game while a yankee victory is unusual in the fact that the yankees lost this series to the arizona diamondbacks . what made this game unique was that this was the 911-year and due to the suspension of baseball that year at midnight of that game it became november . it was the first baseball game played in november . and derek jeter homered in the bottom of the tenth thus becoming the first `` mr. november '' . the two bonus dvds are worth the price of admission on their own . they include all the mlb world series videos plus a plethora of bonus footage that includes roger `` rocket '' clemens <NUM> alsc game <NUM> masterpiece . other inclusions are highlights from gooden 's no hitter , david cone 's and david well 's perfect games , jeter 's alds series saving flip , and many other highlights by names like david justice , jim leyritz , and paul o'neill . there is abundance of behind the scenes footage that includes locker room , interviews and press conferences and much , much more . the packaging is a trivia buffs delight as it is full of boxscores , highlights and facts . it will jar your memory reading the cases alone . these disks are a must have for yankee fans . as soon as i posted the banners i saw many of you pre order these fine dvds . so what are the rest of you waiting for ?
i thought i was taking a bit of chance buying this cd , as i was only familiar with the classics `` for your love '' and `` heart full of soul '' , but i was on a british invasion kick . wow ! this cd like , blew me away , man . for only one surprise , i was delighted to discover `` shapes of things '' - a great tune i certainly remembered , but never knew its name or its yb origin . the only other piece i sort of recall was `` the train kept a-rollin '' which was featured in re-worked form in the antonioni film `` blow up '' . this , and the rest that was completely new to me , i just love : `` evil hearted you '' and `` mr. you 're a better man than i '' are two others i find buzzing through my head throughout the day . even if i 'm a tad less patient with live stuff , which can veer into show-offy , formless indulgence , these guys can pull it off , as i find myself digging that fuzz-guitar/feedback rave-up ( plus they know enough not to go on forever ) . i 'll most definitely look into this band further - their music and their story . enthusiastically recommended to anyone with any curiousity about this band
as i struggle to renew my faith and walk with the lord jesus , i find this devotional bible an excellent way to start and end the day . it 's comforting how each daily devotion seems to address deeply personal issues regarding my feelings and concerns regarding being a better husband , father , and , most importantly , a better christian . highly recommended
not too many children 's authors could get away with a story in which a bad little boy is eaten up by a lion , but sendak handles this potentially unsettling story line with a master 's touch . children will love the repetition of `` i do n't care , '' which seems to be pierre 's response to everything , and the varied rhyme scheme keeps the text from becoming a monotonous set of couplets . after his exasperated parents leave him home alone ( the picture of them walking away from pierre 's perspective might actually be more of a threat to the listener than being eaten ) , a lion shows up at his house . the foolhardy pierre is not impressed in the slightest , and wo n't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten . after pierre 's parents return home , they figure out what happened , assault the lion , and take him to the hospital , where a chastened pierre is extracted uninjured . sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there . like shel silverstein and roald dahl , there is a hint of wickedness to his work , but it 's all in good fun . this is a classic , pure and simple ; a complete sendak collection is a good idea for any child !
this move gets my vote as i 'm some one of the liquid tv era i enjoyed see the animated aeon take a real person roll . the movie leaves room for sequals as was the idea with origonal animated version . hopefully there will be more to come . she 's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation . the science fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence . it would be nice if mtv was still as entertaining as aeon
this is the allman brothers best , i do n't need to go on . just own it
in an inventive , imaginative plot , john dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation . each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who , about what ? cliff janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent , canny , suspicious , and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself . what makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles , regardless of risk . an intriguing backstory , twisty subplot , and surprise ending make sign of the book another page-turner
profondo rosso is probably goblin 's finest hour in the soundtrack department , though i think many would debate that suspiria and zombi might be a little better . i wo n't go into the music , coz i ca n't imagine someone buying this cd who 's unfamiliar with the film and the music from the film . you do get your money 's worth , this sucker is <NUM> minutes long . my only complaint with this , and all the other goblin soundtracks is that there are about eight billion different versions of the same song . i know people like this , but to me it gets a little irritating . the alternate versions are n't really all that different from one another ( with a few exceptions ) -at least not different enough to want to hear the song again when you just heard it one or two tracks ago . i mean , do we really need that many versions of the lullaby song ? but on the other hand , i do respect the fact that cinevox went out of their way to make this as complete as possible . and considering you have to take out a loan to pay for these soundtracks , it does n't seem so bad in the end . what it really comes down to is-if you like the music when you watch the film , then you 'll like this cd
a great album . not perfect . the songs themselves are addictive , inventive despite sounding like something you 've heard before , crunchy and sexy . i love how holme 's voice changes from song to song . a great vocalist , which leads me to wonder why eagles of death metal has him on drums and that macho macho man wanabe on vocals . the real star of this album though is the guy who 's not even in the band , dave grohl . his drum playing on this album is incredible . good stuff . get rid of the annoying radio clips and the terrible 6th song and it would deserve a 5/5
this album is the single reason jewel is what she is today . without this album i feel that jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically , at least not to the point of success she has today . raw , untraditional , brave , naked , these can all descibe her first album . unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm . worth a listen
from the pop title track , a duet with kid rock protege uncle kracker , to the heartstring tug of there goes my life , this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres . chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star , earning the status more from his music than his pretty boy image . aside from the title track , most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing , young jimmy buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work

the romantic days of the search for the `` missing link '' are gone , and as science writer carl zimmer reminds us , that is all to the good since the very idea of a `` missing link '' is a misdirection . what we have today is the search for human ancestors and for a distinction to be made between our ancestors and other ancient hominids . this book with its beautiful prints and photos , engaging drawings and helpful charts , and especially the sprightly text by zimmer brings the general reader up to date ( circa <NUM> ) on the latest developments . there 's a lot going on . there 's the controversy about homo floresiensis , thought to be a tiny hominid , found in indonesia in 2004. zimmer presents the arguments . some think that homo floresiensis is an island adaptation of home erectus , the first hominid to make it out of africa 1.8 million years ago . after all , island adaptation often leads to diminished size . there are fossils of now extinct small elephants in indonesia . but others believe that the skull found is an anomaly , a case of microcephaly , a birth defect . i 'm betting on the latter . there are wooden spears found that are around 400,000 years old , meaning that homo habilis or homo ergaster ( who may be one and the same ) or the more recently discovered homo heidelbergensis were accomplished tool makers long before homo sapiens arrived on the scene . there is the idea that homo neanderthalensis is a cold climate , european adaptation of homo erectus . part of the excitement in paleontology is in the new fossil finds , and part is in our new-found ability to analyze dna samples to map the spread of homo sapiens . this allows us to see the `` out of africa '' phenomenon in three main stages : ( <NUM> ) homo erectus leaving africa 1.8 million years ago , followed by ( <NUM> ) homo heidelbergensis expanding into not only europe and the near east and china , but into southeast asia as well . finally ( <NUM> ) , about 130,000 years ago , homo sapiens begin to move out of africa , first into the levant and then into east asia and australia ( 50,000 years ago ) , then into europe and siberia ( 40,000 years ago ) and ultimately into the americas ( 20,000 years ago ) . incidentally , this book has homo sapiens coming onto the scene almost 200,000 years ago . zimmer talks about the various hominid cultures and speculates on their social and religious possibilities . on the subject of what happened to the neanderthal , he intimates that he believes it was a combination of things that allowed humans to survive while the neanderthals went extinct , including being better able to adapt to climate change , having a more sophisticated culture and better hunting techniques . i think it 's also possible ( actually i think it 's likely ) that humans were better at killing not only herd animals but the competition as well , meaning that one of the reasons that the neanderthals are gone is because we killed them . zimmer more or less skirts around this , waiting ( wisely , i think ) until further evidence is in . in a final chapter , `` where do we go from here ? '' zimmer briefly discusses biotechnology and genetic engineering , and how our species might be affected by cultural evolution . this is a handsome book it 's like a coffee table book with the high gloss , heavy pages and the beautiful artwork , but smaller in size . most significantly it is a book aimed at the general reader that is well written , well edited , and very well presented . and it is clear . it is in fact the clearest book on human origins -- usually a very murky subject -- that i have read . by the way , zimmer is the author of several excellent science books . i especially recommend his creepy , but fascinating , parasite rex : inside the bizarre world of nature 's most dangerous creatures ( <NUM> )
now this is how the art of tom of finland should be represented ... in a volume large enough for us to appreciate the great detail in his work . unfortunately , the people at taschen and the tom of finland foundation found it necessary to re-release this wonderful volume in a smaller , cheaper version , and that trend has only gotten worse with the recent release of tom 's `` comic collection '' - which i reviewed negatively only to see that entire title withdrawn from amazon in less that <NUM> hours after my review appeared ... so to read that review , you 'll have to click `` see all my reviews '' . is n't censorship , especially in the erotic art world , a real pity ! -- click on `` see all my reviews
this is guy ritchie 's first movie . very few screenwriters and directors can say they their first endeavor was so successful . this is an amazing story that is clever , funny , and unpredictable . i wish i could write movies like this ! a must see for any serious film fan
this is an excellent book for anyone thinking about starting framing as a business or a hobby . mr. logan explains nearly every aspect of the craft
i saw ofm when it first came out , over ten years back . it was on cable the other day . it still keeps me glued to the set . bill paxton , billy bob thornton , michael beach .... great work . too bad this one did n't get more media and a larger audience
this christmas special is a must have if you 're a christina fan or if you think shes untalented give it a look to see just how talented she really is . not only does christina sing her hit songs , `` genie in a bottle , '' `` what a girl wants , '' and `` i turn to you , '' she also sings some christmas classics also on her christmas album , my kind of christmas . christina also sings some songs that are n't on her cds like `` climb every mountain , '' from the sound of music , one of christina 's favorite movies . also included : `` alright now , '' and etta james ' `` at last . '' the christmas songs she sings are `` merry christmas baby , '' `` have yourself a merry little christmas , '' and her song `` christmas time , '' which is new on her christmas cd , my kind of christmas . not only does christina sing in english but she sings two of her spanish songs `` contigo en la distanica , '' and `` falsas espernazas . '' special guests : lil bow wow , brian mcknight , and dr. john christina nails all of the songs on this dvd , its absolutely amazing , defenitely worth a watch and better then her previous dvd genie gets her wish
eazy-e is my favorite rapper and i find him highly underrated . he was easily the best member in nwa and the hype surrounding his death should have been much bigger . he is a one-of-a kind rap genius with a sound unlike anybody else . this album is a masterpiece and is perfect in every way . the opening song still talkin ' is hilarious and eazy drops freestyles that sound like he isnt even trying . to hear some of his best verses of all time check out no more ? s which is my absolute favorite song done by him ever . the album flows together beautifully and even the bonus songs at the end are funny including merry muthaf * * * in ' xmas which is classic . other classics include ruthless villian , <NUM> hard mutha 's , boyz-n-the hood remix , eazy-duz-it and we want eazy . there is no doubt in my mind that he should be a legend along with pac and biggie ... he just left way before he could establish himself as big as them . also the feud with dre and death row hurt his reputation greatly right before he died . nonetheless he is amazing and dre & mc ren also add to this great cd . do not hold out .. buy this asap
as a texan who first moved to europe at age <NUM> in <NUM> , pell 's book was like reading the story of my life . and yet it made me understand so many things that were always something of a conundrum ( such as why the french looked down on everything american in general but adored the kennedy 's ) to the sinister goings-on of the mccarthy era ( they actually burned books considered subversive in american embassies abroad , such as `` works by notorious radicals like mark twain and theodore dreiser '' ) . i got this book because i wanted to have a better understanding of why the u.s. is where it is today , and it more than filled the bill , in an all-emcompassing way . thank you , mr. pells
i have read at least <NUM> books on raising rabbits and this one is the best by far ! ( bennett 's other rabbit books are also great - but there is a lot of overlap so only one is needed . ) i used his information every step of the way when building my rabbitry , including building my own all-wire hutches . if you are interested in raising rabbits , be sure to join the arba ( american rabbit breeder 's association at http : //arba.net/ ) it is very inexpensive to join and membership includes a free copy of the `` official guide book raising better rabbits & cavies '' <NUM> pages and another great book . the book itself is worth the membership , but you also get a subscription to the magazine `` domestic rabbits .
i love the last five years so much and so when this came out i got it immeadiately . the song over is so great i listened to it over and over ( no pun intended ) i thnk no one does a ballad like jason and i highly recommend the whole albu
i am returning to the market after several years in the motion picture industry and was looking for a refresher on the business end of photography . vik orenstein has provided a wonderful primer for both beginner and professional alike , and i unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about pursuing a career in photography . she thoroughly covers necesary subjects such as choosing cpas and lawyers , networking , and the various photographic markets available for pursuit . she does all of this in a winsome way , relating both her successes and failures as she developed and grew her own studios . if you are considering entering the field of photography as a professional , seriously consider purchasing this book . you will be making a very wise investment
karen o'connor 's new book is a gem . i found myself laughing out loud , nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family . i 've always enjoyed ms. o'connor 's other books , but this is the best yet . it 's also a book to share . buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents & quot ; just because. & quot ; that 's what i 'm going to do
this was the first nora roberts book that i had read and it is now , i think , my most favorite book i have ever read . i have never been interested in reading a romance before , but this struck me as being different and it was ! it has romance in it difinately ... very good romance i might add ... but it is a thriller ! i could n't put it down and i 'm not kidding ! i read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because i just do n't have that much time to read . i found my self making time to read this book ! it is very graphic with the murders , rapes and animal killings , but reading that kind of stuff does n't really bother me . it 's seeing it in a movie that i ca n't handle . but i think nora roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic . you just want to kill this guy , and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is . not only is the suspense awsome , but her characters are great . you just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel . i loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch , ride horses , and heard cattle and stuff like that . everything about the book is just awsome !
i had previously bought the 1st version . liked it very much . so i was eagerly looking forward to this latest version . happy to know that this version has more new science related information - which was what i was interested in . and for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist , there is a seperate section entirely on interviews . the best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations . for those who have not seen the 1st version , i think it is alright to watch this . viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie . the interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer . everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world , universe and what they are made of . if you had deep question about the reality , you might find an answer in this movie . -- ravi , singapor
this is a good introductory book about radar . i would recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn about radar .
fighter pilot lays claim to being the first published account of aerial combat during the second world war . originally published anonymously during the war , the author literally flew missions during the day while meeting with the editor in pubs at night to finish the book . richey 's book reads like a daily journal of his adventures after deploying to france in <NUM> to wait out the `` phony war . '' once germany blitzed france and the low countries though , things became very busy very quickly . richey , like his compatriots , fought bravely , but they were greatly outnumbered . as france 's defenses collapsed , there was very little they could do . one of the most interesting aspects is how his view of the war changes from before the shooting war through just a few weeks of real fighting . their original notion of their work is very chivalrous and idealistic , with lots of references to `` our turn '' to repeat the noble efforts of the aces from world war i . after downing their first german , they gather war trophies from the plane , take pictures , and invited a captured german pilot over for beer and celebration . a few weeks later , as the british expeditionary force continues to retreat , france collapses , and many of their squadron mates in the earlier photos have been killed , there is little chivalry and idealism left . they settle into the grim business of fighting for their life , realizing that the battle of france is lost and growing fear for what will happen to britain . even in comparing it to world war one accounts ( mccudden , lewis , or biddle ) , initially there is a lot of similarity in the events and encounters . then , it quickly spirals into a brutal onslaught . the book is easy to read and flows very well . most readers are probably surprised to learn the book finishes before the battle of britain begins . fortunately , there is a sequel , fighter pilot 's summer , that richey started during the war , but which was n't completed until after his death in the <NUM> 's . any aviation and world war ii history buff will be extremely happy with the book and primary source material . this is particularly true given the wealth of information on the battle of britain , but the dearth of writing on the air war over france that was the prelude . this book fills an important gap in first hand accounts of aerial combat during the battle for france .
this was a good book because it show some values that you can find on the family , and how emily try to understand why her mama did n't like the desert . after she start to find answers at her questions she also get to know better her grandmama ola by making a videotape where she get to know better ola 's friends and learn to get along with people . this book show the way that this people were traveling scaping from something that is call saness going through different places , the real reason that ola was runing away from alabama was to save diane from the ugliness deth like it say on the book but this was n't the good way because you have to get infrom of your problems to solves them . that is why i agree with diane that ola was n't suppose to run away fron something she should n't . by the time emily find the reason diane did n't like the desert was because she did n't want to get away from the pain of her father that she found dead near a field of kudzu . that was the day that emily really felt for her mama and understand her loss . it say that diane wo n't ever forgive her mother from ripping it away . because i think that the only things that where attach to diane and that she remember about her father were gone and the only memory she has about her father were in her heart and that is okay because she will never forget her father even that she do n't have any oject that may remember her him . i think that emily realize that it really do n't take that long to get to know someboy if you really want to know them . i think emily haves a positive change because she learn to appreciate more her family and to understand the situation they hava passe . i think ola and emily really like the desert because there they really felt free like a bird and freedon if one of the most important value in the world . if you do n't think like that i do . i really like this book even that it show all the pain this people have and or their loss . but at the end it really teach you that family is very important if you have n't read this book do it because it can help you to apreciate it more . that all i have to say i hope you like what i have done
i was just really able to appreciate this film . sure there were some lines that i did n't like and and i was a little unclear about some plot aspects and i wished we could have seen what happens to the characters after the film ended . but overall , i really loved the message of the film and the originality of it . this is a film about love , sexuality , and relationships . it was really beautiful . most of what i must praise highest is the acting . every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered . corazza 's is a very believable and truthful actor . his acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what matt needed . taylor was brilliant . she exudes power and assurance . and she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly . she was perfection . allison was surprising convincing and excellent . i say surprising because for a man dressed in woman 's clothing , this is the first movie where i actually liked the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype . shannon was real person for me . boyd was absolutely excellent . she seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art . they were so lucky to get her for this . she 's a world-class actress . this film was just really enjoyable . i really found the writer 's ( fraser ) commentary to be especially interesting . this film was daring , original , and well-directed . a little unbelievable at points , but enjoyable none the less .
we actually own the cd that was originally released when the movie was first released . it is one of our favorites . i 'm not sure what several others are talking about when they say this one has the origninal score . the cd 's have the same exact music , with the exception of the 2nd cd . as for the songs on the 2nd cd , we have heard several on radio disney . they are okay once you get passed the whole remake issue . i actually enjoy the jonas brothers version of poor unfortunate souls .
postrel forces you to think explicitly about the future . i have <NUM> children . thus i have more invested in the future than most people . the future my children and grandchildren inherit and create be mostly shaped by people with dynamist views . after all , it is the dynamists who created civilization . to be sure , history is full of examples where the forces of stasis won over the dynamists , sometimes for centuries . however , i think the future is with the dynamists . i 'm betting this book will be considered a seminal classic <NUM> years from now .
this book is first published in <NUM> . right in the beginning , drucker defined management as not only business management , but management in all kinds of organization : government , university , hospital , army , non-profit organization , etc . the book is easy to read , just below <NUM> pages . the scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is . it describes the certainties : collapsing birthrate , shift in performance , global competitiveness , etc , and of course , how it affects all kinds of organizations . it talks about information challenges , the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century . concepts like `` individuals will outlive their organization '' , `` how to defines one 's goal and contribution '' are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face , since , this is the realities . i highly recommend this book to anyone , not just ceo/executives , but those want to know more about oneself , how to behave and contribute in this knowledge base world
i see some people saying this movie was not all it was said to have been . but you definately had to have seen this during the early <NUM> 's to relate to it and it was only meant for the people that actually lived in this time era . for most of you seeing it for the first time in <NUM> , it wont make sense to you and seem outdated . if your recollection of hip hop is n.w.a . or the likes , you will know nothing about this movie or relate to it in anyway - this is raw hip hop
i thought it was an interesting read , it 's a trip to see all the 'marve ' heroes get what they want in life . spiderman a hero , logan having his memory and the story is interesting . if you did n't follow avengers disassembled i 'd recommend reading that first
daniel handler is just one of the more vivid fiction writers out there . it 's great to see him show his adult side with this collection of short stories which seek to explore his forays outside of snicketville . i love the story where the character forces himself on the cabbie . read this one by the pool this weekend . i 'd love to see him write a non-lemony novel , too
i loved this book . i picked it up on a whim and spent the next two hours reading and laughing . the patterns are fun and these girls are so funny . i think this is a great book to have in my library . it has several patterns that i really want to make as gifts and i think even the book would make a great gift to any knitter
wow , what an excellent dvd ! since the first time we put it on for our <NUM> months old daughter , she has been hooked to it . this is an excellent dvd for kids starting from <NUM> months . lots and lots of color and classical music keep the kid busy constantly . the combination of colors , objects and music greatly enhances their ability to think and relate to everyday things . i highly recommend this to all parents . my wife found out about this while searching for baby einstein dvd .
my mother gave me this cd over a year ago and i could n't find any feedback about the album . the album was n't in the stores either . whomever compiled the songs did an excellent job and it touched me like his 1st album did . i played it so much that the cd player scratched it . fortunately , soulife is out now and i can purchase it to support anthony . anybody that loves his 1st will love this one and ai n't nobody worryin ' as well . he is a must see in concert
yes , i was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming remington steele , which i actually preferred to moonlighting . pierce brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang british that i wanted to be like him . the fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique . and lord , i had such a crush on laura holt , who was beautiful , clever , earnest , athletic and kinda prudish ( turns out , our little miss prim & proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check ) . anyways , i 'm a sucker for freckles . one of the best things about season one was the ultra-cool theme song by the great henry mancini . the music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery . another cool thing was the intro voice-over of stephanie zimbalist : `` try this for a deep , dark secret . the great detective remington steele ? he does n't exist . i invented him . follow ... '' and so , we do . skip this paragraph if you know the show 's premise . laura holt is a very capable sleuth whose private investigative agency is n't drawing in the clients , mostly because she 's a woman . so she invents a front man - a decidedly masculine superior - named remington steele ( according to laura , `` remington '' is derived from a brand of typewriter , while `` steele '' is from the pittsburg steelers ) . soon , sure enough , clients are coming in droves . and then , one day , he walked in . episode one , license to steele , tells of the chance encounter between laura holt and a charming , urbane thief who steals her heart and , while he 's at it , the name and identity of her agency . the show remington steele ushered in a short era of sophistication and sly humor that recalled the best of vintage hollywood . brosnan and zimbalist may not have gotten along well in real life , but as steele and holt , they were a match made in heaven . the show was ably supported by the yearning murphy ( james read ) , who never did get over his suspicions ( not totally unfounded ) about steele , and the gum-chewing bernice fox ( janet demay ) , whose name remington chose to not clearly remember , much to her annoyance . too bad the powers-that-be decided murphy and bernice were in the way of remington and laura 's blossoming romance ; they were written out by season two . the mysteries themselves were n't all that original , more than a few being patterned after the plots of famous movies , which ties in nicely with remington 's penchant for quoting from hollywood 's golden age . but viewers did n't tune in for the quality of the mystery elements ( do n't get me wrong , they did n't suck ) , but rather - much like the classic thin man films - for the nova-intense chemistry between the two leads and their up-and-down romantic relationship . it would take a few seasons before their always-on-the-verge-but-never-quite-consumated flirtation became frustrating for the audience . this season is the first and by far the best . highlight episodes of season one are : license to steele ( episode <NUM> ) - private eye laura holt is hired to protect some valuable , high profile jewelry , but an enigmatic ( but very suave ) british scam artist keeps popping up . serious eye contact and innuendos are exchanged between the two , which later results in the con-man ( who has his own problems ) taking up the identity of the fictitious remington steele . needless to say , a must see episode . thou shalt not steele ( episode <NUM> ) - a woman ( cassandra harris , brosnan 's real wife at the time ) from steele 's mysterious past convinces steele to steal a painting rumored to be cursed from a los angeles museum exhibit . problem is , laura had already contracted to protect the valuable painting . fun episode with remington and laura dabbling in professional thieving . this is the debut of felicia , remington 's ex-flame , who shows up again in season <NUM> . in the steele of the night ( episode <NUM> ) - laura and murphy attend a reunion party consisting of sleuths who used to work for the havenhurst agency . one of the detectives is killed and remington ( who crashes the get-together ) is elected to solve the murder . very amusing , as laura handfeeds clues to remington , who attempts to look knowledgeable in front of his `` peers . '' steele trap ( episode <NUM> ) - this one channels agatha christie 's classic and then there were none . remington and laura show up at a weekend bash on the private island of a smut magazine publisher . and then people start getting killed off one by one . vintage steele ( episode <NUM> ) - shenanigans in a winery and a recurring corpse . laura stripteases and the two finally kiss . this is a cool episode and one of the most romantic . we finally find out stuff about laura 's past , specifically the reason why laura does n't like to mix business with pleasure . steele 's gold ( episode <NUM> ) - remington , laura , and murphy follow a prospector 's journal , hoping to unearth gold . hijinks in a ghost town and a wild treasure hunt in the desert . fun episode . sting of steele ( episode <NUM> ) - the first sighting of daniel chalmers ( efrem zimbalist jr. - stephanie 's dad ) , remington 's mentor and surrogate dad , who shows up needing steele 's assistance in putting on an intricate sting to shake some villains off his back . another vintage episode . this box set contains four discs with all <NUM> episodes . special features contain three episode commentaries ( license to steele , tempered steele , and vintage steele ) , as well as several making-of featurettes and character bios . give this show a chance and see why it launched pierce brosnan to hollywood 's stratosphere .
this dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing . her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange , takes some getting use to . it kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time i put it in ! this is the dvd i like to use before i go to my yoga class for some reason . i guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up . she uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change . a great one to have in your library . beautiful scenery also
unlike sorcerer hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot , this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first . my almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before i bought it . there 's a lot of familiar voice actors ( adv studio-andrew klimko/sorcerer hunters-gateau ) & kelly manison/s.h.-big mama , martian successor nadesico-haruka , excel-great will of the macroverse . japanese actors tomokazu seki/m.s.nadesico-gai daigoji , card captor sakura-toya , x-kamui & kotono mitsushi/sailor moon-usagi , excel saga-excel , blue seed-kome . they even got dbz 's bulma-hiromi tsuru on ep <NUM> ) so the whole thing comes off pretty well . i found the plot a bit thin -- or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters ' clothes off almost every ep , but i did laugh quite a bit
i originially bought this book because i am a fan of mcsorley 's and wanted to learn a little about new york history . i had no previous knowledge of joseph mitchell 's works , and did not know what to expect . i wondered how someone could write a <NUM> page book about when bar . then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the <NUM> 's and <NUM> 's . primary source history usually bores me , because it is often dry , about someone consequential , and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information . but the way mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight , eccentricities , or just regular routines . i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city , or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel
this is a great broadway soundtrack . mandy patinkin has an amazing voice , and the singing is amazing . do n't bother with the pathetic movie version
this is one of the best live dvd 's ever . some of the songs are more impressive on this dvd than on their studio cd counterparts . the atlanta symphony youth orchestra is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are exceptional . the behind the scenes extras are very entertaining and enlightening . the crowd has great energy , as does the band who are getting even better with age . video and audio are high quality with a really good 5.1 mix . there are n't many concert 5.1 mixes that i 've liked but they got it right on this one
i love the little jibe provided within the title of hernando de soto 's `` the other path . '' it 's a poke at `` the shining path '' ( sendero luminoso ) , the maoist peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de soto 's homeland beginning in 1980. de soto 's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient . to those who know de soto 's work , the solutions are well known : build a system of laws that allow one 's residents to buy , sell and value property rights ; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business . if you 've read de soto 's master work `` the mystery of capitalism , '' then there is no new news here . in fact , `` the other path '' will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics . so why the five stars ? as a testament to de soto 's bravery . think about the guts it took for him to research and publish this book in peru during the tumultuous and frightening period there . what a statement .
having read this book in <NUM> and recently purchased it for my collection , this a great read with various chapters based on history , politcal , and social mores of african- americans ( in the black corner ) and our archenemies white americans ( in the white corner ) . got to hype up the race war angle some of you white conservatives who are doing it in your reviews about this book . if you have a politcal agenda you will either like or hate hacker 's book based on your politcal afilliation , if you are a liberal , you may like the senstive and fair airing he gives towards the history of why we became two nations.if you are a conservative or neo- nazi type like the white racist from georgia that african- americans have no morals , or you will hate that he 's giving black folks a pass on their moral problems . well as a black nationalist who believes that intergration is bad social policy but a majority black commonwealth on american soil may be benefical , i think that historical factors presented in hacker 's book would prevent both sides from ever seeing each other in any rational sense as americans because <NUM> . whites see each other as intellectually , morally superior to african - americans ( even the lowest white trash person ) and will never consider them equal in the eyes of u.s. law or in their hearts <NUM> . african - americans ( especailly males ) will never forgive or forget what the majority white population did to their families , culture , livelihoods and community structures especailly after slavery . hacker has crafted an excellent book through great research and in many ways he is on point throughout the book , when he states the the majority white population will make hispanics and asians `` honoray whites '' demonizing black males for politcal and social advantage against charges of racism by blacks . and many of your reviewers are right about some blacks hating whites , i think <NUM> years of continual defacto racism would create some blacks who would hurt their fellow blacks ( in a self- destructive way ) whites and other citizens ( some blacks hate whites like the arabs hate jews ) .i consider that like the scene in the movie `` independence day '' , when `` president '' bill pullman asked the alien , pullman - can there be peace between our worlds alien - nooooooooo no peace ! ! ! ! pullman - what do you want from us ? alien i want you to die ! ! ! ! ! let the hate mail begin ! ! ! ! at least i was `` candid '' in our so- called dicussion on race
purchase this cd - do n't hesitate . this album with make you tap your feet and clap your hands . it 's up , down , spin around . their own unique sound splashed with hints of other artist influences . instant gratification once you hit play ! a blender of the rentals , concretes , velvet underground , cure , psychadelic furs , snow patrol , mercury rev , belle & sebastian , ride , wedding present , and spiritualized
this is visually beautiful book that tells a beautiful story . this is a story of courage and strength . togo 's story needs to be told . i even purchased a copy for my son 's elementary school library
moonspell 's <NUM> release is another one of my favorites right next to `` wolfheart '' . this one is almost as good as their first but comes up short in some areas . it is their second best release , in my opinion , but doesnt have as much atmosphere as `` wolfheart '' did . it 's good all the way through which is important , because an album that weakens near the end is never good . my favorite tracks are probably `` from lowering skies '' , `` antidote '' , `` capricorn at her feet '' , and `` walk on the darkside '' . here are my track ratings ... <NUM> . in and above men - 10/10 <NUM> . from lowering skies - 10/10 <NUM> . everything invaded - 8.5/10 <NUM> . southern deathstyle - 8/10 <NUM> . antidote - 10/10 <NUM> . capricorn at her feet - 10/10 <NUM> . lunar still - 10/10 <NUM> . walk on the darkside - 10/10 <NUM> . crystal gazing - 9.5/10 <NUM> . as we eternally sleep on it - 8.5/10 overall : <NUM> % a- it 's another solid release from moonspell . anyone into doom metal would enjoy this . it 's also just the way i like it , sprinkled with growling vocals and regular vocals , because i 'm not a fan of songs where the screaming/growling vocals take up the entire song . anyway it 's one of their best , in my opinion , so if you have not already checked it out , you probably should .
great read ! love all his stuff . much of a deeper memoir than `` running with scissors '' . if you enjoyed that book , you will rip through `` dry '' in no time . currently reading `` possible side effects '' , which is also very good . highly recommend this author in general
i love all of e lynn harris novels , he is an outstanding author and his novels touches people from the inside out . janie de coster author of man of my dreams
this is really an artful piece of work . eisner was a revolutionary . he paved the way for stories that were embedded in reality . he really inspired another legend , frank miller who produced daredevil 's best run and sin city . these are some really gripping stories that grasped at my heart strings i felt sorry for the wife of the alley singer , i felt sorry for the rabbi who lost his daughter , etc . well it seems i just felt sorry for these folks . if you 're a comic fan , you love reality represented and you like tan and white ( which eisner said is the color people dream in ) then this is the book for you
there are a few tracks that stand out on this album . pistolero is fantastic with its spicy latin sound , and masters of the universe is good in the typical way . the deep throaty vocal samples in the track entitled badimo are very interesting , and carry a unique vibration . i wonder what it means ... if you like juno reactor , this album is worth a look at least
this era of tangerine dream ( td ) was just great . the virgin years were truly a great period for td . for me it deals with space and landscape . it 's so close to repetitive music that would come much later . it 's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies . you could fly with them and end up with more in the end . you ca n't say that for too many of these electronic groups . after that period they would go on with this ambient music that was n't up to the same standards . it seems they are back ( with other musicians of course ) with the same kind of concept . great ! they were an important link on the electronic scene . a great album ! a great period
ja rodgers was ahead of his time when it came to historical reserch . he exposed alot of things that even in our xenophobic world we are afriad to talk about . he discovered through his reserch many of the great people of the past was infact blacks , and that they had been covered up by white wash over centuries . people should read these books with an open mind , because it explains alot in our soceity that are very race conscious people . i learned about al jahiz though him and he taught me about many great people i had never even heard of . i never knew about lokman the southern arabian sage that was considered one of the wisest men . i never knew about the black vikings in this book called blaumen . the book also discussed how many people of the royal family have indeed black ancestry and how they have tried to hide these facts . get this book to expose the truth and check out other ja rodgers books
so you now have the honor of creating an information security program ! where to start and what to do is clearly laid out for you in this book . this is a must have for anyone setting out to create a new security program within a company . also beneficial for it directors and cios to get a broad introduction and discussion on security and disaster recovery planning . i keep this book handy at my desk
it was <NUM> , and the association , hot off the success of their third album , `` insight out , '' and it 's monster hit single , `` windy , '' went back into the studio and recorded their fourth album , `` birthday . '' once again , this classy sextet deliver some of the best flower-power pop-rock ever made . these catchy , melodic songs are truly awesome , highlighted by the band 's expert musical chemistry and vocal harmonies . the album includes more association classics as `` like always , '' `` everything that touches you , '' `` time for livin ' , '' and `` time it is today , '' but also such great buried treasures like the punchy `` come on in , '' the beautiful `` rose petals , incense and a kitten '' ( a silly title , i know , but the song is truly gorgeous ) , the equally exquisite `` toymaker , '' the haunting `` barefoot gentleman , '' and the excellent `` bus song , '' featuring a great bit of barbershop vocalising in the middle . when it comes to pop-rock , the association were ( and are ) true geniuses . `` birthday '' is a brilliant album , one of the band 's best .
i first saw this movie on the family channel several years ago and fell in love with it ! what a great , light hearted , and fun movie ! this is `` clean '' romantic , fun movie to watch . great actors too ! this is one you will want to watch over and over again
beautiful music and a nice variety , what you would expect from windhill . the only flaw , tracks five and six are switched from the list on the album cover ; # <NUM> is & quot ; first noel & quot ; and # <NUM> is & quot ; christmas is coming & quot ; . highly recommended
first episode does an especially good job of capturing some of the essence of ocd ( obsessive compulsive disorder )
david levithan 's newest novel , `` wide awake , '' is a political novel set `` in the near future . '' here 's the set up : `` the greater depression happened . the events of 3/12 and 7/23 happened . the andreas quake and hurricane wanda . the president launched his war to end all wars , which only managed to create more wars and the tragic events of 4/5 . the greater depression deepened . millions of people died , and there was no way to erase their faces from the more renegade open news channels , which wanted to remind everyone how bad the government had let things get . the decents and their program of denial education reached their peak . '' the hero and narrator of `` wide awake '' is a jewish , gay teen named duncan who is engaged politically for the first time in his life . after all the troubles of his childhood and the generation ( s ) before , it seems as if a new era is on the horizon . his presidential candidate , abraham stein , a jewish gay man with a partner and children , has been elected . people are behaving differently , celebrating their ethnic , cultural , and sexual differences . and supporting them all is a sizable group of jesus freaks . `` for the jesus revolutionaries , the answer was clear : jesus would not be out waging `` preventative '' wars . jesus would not be withholding medicine from people who could not afford it . jesus would not cast stone at people of races , sexual orientations , or genders other than his own . jesus would not condone the failing , viperous , scandal-plagued hierarchy of some churches . jesus would welcome everyone to his table . he would love them , and he would find peace . '' sounds like a utopian novel so far , right ? but there 's a hitch . a hitch in the form of kansas . stein 's election is being contested . to the tune of 1,000 votes . ( sound familiar ? ) stein calls all his supporters to kansas and duncan and his friends head to topeka to support their candidate . while `` wide awake '' is a political novel , levithan does not abandon the everyday . duncan struggles in his relationship with gorgeous jimmy , teachers can be kind or belligerent , parents are sometimes more conservative than you 'd like , and friends take sides in everyday breakups . but , in the end , levithan 's message is one of hope . people can be good and good people can change even the worst-case scenario into a better present and future . `` wide awake '' is for older teens , ages <NUM> and up .
the wire is easily one of the greatest , if not the greatest , cinematic pieces of art ever . potential watchers know this however , this is a show that requires a significant amount of commitment ; do not expect to sit back and be entertained . the show challenges the watcher and requires reflection on an array of intellectual levels . at a minimum , the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots the wire 's creators masterfully placed for viewers . the dull on the other hand will only see a show with cops and a group of unintelligible thugs while searching for the quick entertainment fix that can only come from brainless shows like cops , csi , or the shield .
great inspirational movie . i was very surprised that my <NUM> yo son also liked it . really good movie for anyone with children that participate in sports . a pleasure for adults too as it is an excellent story about how with focus , discipline and perserverance , you can reach your goals
my son is obsessed with this movie , as he is with everything scooby . but he says he give it <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> because in this one the gang spends half the movie not being friends ( but then they do make up )
freedom fighters forever ! the short review : way past cool ! if you 're a fan of the series you have to have this dvd collection ! the long review : episodes for anyone who 's had to stand watching cut or badly recorded episodes from tv , i ca n't express how good it feels to watch these in clear stereo with no tracking lines and perfect picture . i can even see the paintbrush strokes in the background art it 's so clear ! so far as i can tell , everything has been restitched back together wonderfully and i can see no weird edits . it 's just like i remember in ben hurst 's words `` fresh - like watching it for the first time ! '' bonus features a few people have complained about the lack of bonus features , but i ca n't say good enough about them . the series was produced <NUM> years ago , since then most if not all of the artwork in the vaults has been lost , sold online ( i 've seen a number of cels pass by there ) or locked away . the fact they managed to find even a small amount of high-quality artwork makes it well worth the trouble . i too wish there was more , but the stuff they did find is very good . i believe there are really only two bits of the extended/deleted scenes that are truly new material but it 's all well archived and the one silent animatic has the script super-scripted in so it 's easy to follow . the concept art is beautiful , there are a few new model/expression sheets in the interview with hurst and tons of background art that will blow you away . this is the same quality one would expect in feature post production work . both of the interviews are engaging , enlightening and even a little tearful at times , especially ben 's moving speech about season <NUM> and his support for the fans . considering how hard the crew at fus has worked to get this dvd , they deserve it . the dvd menus themselves are a blast -- i have seen a number of poorly produced menus with `` craptastic '' art in them and these blow me away . they are thoughtful and even funny ! in one part snively hits the `` bonus features '' button . it 's the little things like that which show the effort and care they put into making the dvd . box art okay so some of the artists who contributed art are very young and are n't what you would call `` good artists '' . but to me , it 's refreshing to see a company that actually wanted and accepted input from the fan base . it shows that we are all united together as fans of sonic , no matter what our background is . you can tell each of the artists was excited and trying their best to make something to show how much they love the show . i go as far to say a few of these artists are exceptional , some of them even drawing `` on-model '' as we in the animation business say . ken penders ( while not really a fan per se since he 's worked professionally on sonic artwork ) did a pretty good job with the cover , as it did include most of the cast and it does n't show anything that is n't there ( thank goodness his arms are n't blue either : d ) . compared to the first test cover , this final one is much better . dr. robotnik is the best part of the cover , he 's very well drawn . anything else ? just so you know where i 'm coming from , i was prime age when satam came out , being <NUM> at the time , and it is a big reason i am who i am today and certainly a reason why i 'm going into the animation industry . that being said i ca n't express enough why it 's important to support this release . they did a fantastic job . and i think it 's worth buying this for any sonic fan , especially if you know someone who likes sonic x -- in sonic 's words , `` get ready to rock , cause this will knock your socks off ! '' : ) if you 're new to sonic and like this series , i highly recommend checking out adventures of sonic the hedgehog , and sonic underground as well ( the other two shows produced by dic , the predecessor to satam and it 's later cousin , respectively . ) a lot of fans would say otherwise but i just ca n't get enough of the blue blur ! - joanie /^
this movie is great , both my daughter and i love it . we watch all the barbie movies and this one is the best ! ! !
there are some great songs on this cd . club paradiso , & quot ; be cool , love child , i found heaven , and the title track are my favs . it 's smooth jazz with a tropical twist . be cool stars dave koz another one of my favorite smooth jazz artists
just great jazz , and it 's enough to tell about that . coltarne , tyner , garrison & jones give you a piece of music you can not forget . you love jazz , you love it .
good action movie . i actually saw this in the theater ( yes , it did have a theatrical release ! ) back in the day . this was about the time when cheap action and horror films were starting to disappear from theaters . excessive force would be straight to video if released today . pity , coz it 's pretty fun . thomas ian griffth never became the next seagal or vandamme-something the producers were obviously trying to do with him-but he really does the action tough guy thing wonderfully . he even had a hand in the script . he 's got the look and the moves , he 's even a decent actor . he went on to do some direct to video action pics , and played the lead vampire in john carpenter 's vampires . you may also remember him as one of the villians from karate kid iii ( the guy who teaches daniel how to break noses ) . other than that , the guy is virtually unknown . the plot does n't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of cops/robbers action , but it 's a cliched film done well . it 's got a better than average supporting cast of james earl jones , lance henriksen , tony todd ( the candyman himself ! ) , and burt young ( paulie from the rocky movies ) . these guys must have also seen potential of the script to want to appear in it . good supporting actors , a good script , and a good performance from the lead raise this otherwise by-the-numbers action movie up a few notches to something quite entertaining
i enjoyed the book emergency : true stories from the nations er , since the stories were all based on actual events . there are some that will make you laugh till you cry and there is some that are real heartbreaking.but i rate this book five stars , and would recomend anyone to read it
what a fantastic continuation of the `` circle '' series . this is a must read for anyone who fancies an escape . ms. roberts ' keen ability to create characters as well as her attention to the finest detail is extraordinary ! highly recommend these books
the fact no one has reviewed this title before now kind of surprises me . this records highlight some great work by monk , max roach , and art blakey ; in addition , this record marks the first time most of these tunes were ever recorded , and there are some classics on here . & quot ; trinkle , tinkle & quot ; , & quot ; blue monk & quot ; , & quot ; bemsha swing & quot ; , and & quot ; little rootie tootie & quot ; ( a lesser known but incredible tune ) are all featured on this disc along with many other wonderful songs . the particular version of & quot ; blue monk & quot ; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark . it clocks in at 7:36 ( the longest track on the record , most tunes are relatively short , preety much like the blue note period length wise ) and features some awesome drum work by blakey . it is really great to hear monk in a trio format , he really shines in this scenario . i would definitely recommend this title to any monk fan , or anyone wanting to start their thelonious collection . it really sets you up for monk 's & quot ; original & quot ; piano style
absolutely great collection of alan jackson 's best , without the filler . a must-have . by the way , is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that alan jackson 's `` songwriting skills need work '' ? !
as with the other reviewers of this film , i must agree that in its restored and complete form , this is an outstanding film . the supplemental material is also quite interesting . the themes in this film are just as relevant today as they were when it was made . most anything else i could write would be redundant with what others have written . i will admit that at points i felt the film dragged a bit , having made a point but not moving on . maybe i am just too much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today . one thing i find curious about this movie is the title . since the main character is not colonel blimp and is really a much deeper character than the cartoon character , i wonder why the film was given the name it was . i wonder how many people went to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character . my minor quibbles aside , this is really an excellent film and worth seeing .
ca n't believe it 's been twenty years , but this movie is still just as funny today as when it came out . great script-a perfect cast and more laugh out loud moments than should be allowed . how steve martin 's character made it through this trip through hell ( some times literally ) without murdering his thrust upon companion is just beyond me . the whole `` you 're driving the wrong way '' scene is truely a classic as well as the question : 'where is your other hand ? ' . absolutely a joy . highly , highly recommended
green day is the largest band in the world right now , the only bad to make the punk rock opera that stormed the world over . people critisize them because they are jealous . they are better and more talented them `` mee-tall-ica '' and rap `` hustlers '' `` iz u with ma '' ( makes no sense ) and they 're angry cuz they 're going strong <NUM> years now and they are capable of real music . hats to those who had good feedback for this incredible album bad critics are jealous too . but of course they 'll deny it like all cowards in this world
this is not a very tough choice , if you like howlin ' wolf or the blues get this box . it has not weak tracks , some fascinating interviews ( well the wolf talking ) , and many of the classic , indispensable tracks.plus , there 's , as evidenced here , no other electric blues guitarist nearly as nasty , dirty , just downright awesome as hubert sumlin . buy and enjoy , this is the blues at its best
the harder they fall is a hard hitting expose of the boxing racket , and a racket it is . excellent performances by humphrey bogart , as a sportwriter turned boxing press agent , rod steiger , edward andrews , nehemiah persoff , and the always great ( and underrated ) jan sterling . an excellent screenplay by philip yordan , from a budd schulberg novel . mark robson 's direction is swift . * * * * * stars
i 'm a ripe old <NUM> years of age and i thought this show was so awesome when i was a young'un . i will get the dvds eventually but wanted to let you fans know that a diecast of the xl5 spaceship will be available soon at fabgearusa.com
i really like the story and this film brings you back to the last century and the ambiance of these times . colin firth is fantastic in this role !
this cd is raw & electric - and one of my all time favorites . i agree with one reviewer who said that he keeps trying to find another r.l . cd with this much energy , but ca n't . i doubt we ever will . if you like the `` quieter '' , more traditional style of `` too bad jim '' , you may not find this to your taste . but for raw power and emotion , you wo n't find anything else like it . i think that 's why i 've played it so much over the past <NUM> years - it 's just different . first you get lulled by `` over the hill '' and then crashed into with `` alice mae '' . also , check out the often overlooked gem on this collection - `` tribute to fred '' . the range on this cd is about as big as the style allows . you 'll reach for this whenever you do n't want to hear the same old sounds
i 've rented several of the barbie movies with my <NUM> year old and this is her absolute favorite , so i 'm thinking of buying it for her for christmas . i doubt i 'd bother buying any of the others , it 's too easy to rent them , but this one stands out for us and she keeps asking to rent it over and over again . do n't buy this if you expect to share the true story of rapunzel with your kids ; there is n't much here from the original , other than the long hair . but it 's an entertaining story ( especially if you 're a girl under the age of <NUM> ! ) and it teaches kids the importance of telling the truth and sticking by your friends even when it is n't the easiest thing to do . my daughter and i enjoyed the extras , too . i 've probably seen this one about <NUM> times so far , and i can honestly say as a parent that it 's not bad : it does n't have me running out of the room each time my daughter asks to start it up , and it does n't drive me nutty over awful , repetitive songs
i heard about this version of the life of christ , but had never seen it . it is a striking black and white telling of the gospel of matthew . it is beautifully filmed ( there are a few problems with subtitles , but you can follow the story just fine ) movie , and very true to matthew 's gospel . as a pastor and a christian , i highly recommend this moving video
although the subject matter itself is n't amusing the characters in the film are . they seem to make light of a bad situation , the likes of which are n't seen anywhere else that i know of with the exception of good morning vietnam . i enjoyed the action scene in this film almost as much as i enjoyed the comic releif , but not as much as i liked the music
... but not all that affective . which is not a bad thing at all . unless there are noble attempts at such a thing , which , i suppose , is really up to debate with this work . but what expectations can one have with a work like this ? what the reader has here is not really a `` novel '' but something greater , something post- , something meta- ( although in a bearable way , at least barnes has taste ) . it is , however , quite educational , very witty , very stylish ( in a good way , see `` barnes has taste '' in the previous sentence for more on this ) but also often quite maladroit , even if in a skillfull way . sometimes , especially in the times when the focus is shifted to the narrator , it feels like the story is being poked into an uncomfortable position , before it returns to its natural form in the next chapter ( like the metal in braces ! ) . but , it is , at the very least , a rewarding book and at the best quite brilliant . very muchso indeed
denise swanson does it again . she 's created a character that is realistic and fun . this is a series that i do n't want to end , i ca n't wait for the next book
i am a math teacher myself so i have always had a special interest in this film . i think it is very well done and it is very inspirational . however , for anyone who wants to know the true story of what happened with escalante and his students , purchase the book `` escalante : the best teacher in america '' by jay mathews . the film leads you to believe that escalante took students who did n't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score 5s on the ap calculus test . this is far from what really happened . escalante spent years developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of calculus . there is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film . the movie portrays it as the testing company ( ets ) accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at garfield high school could n't have possibly known the material . the true story is that some answers on the ap tests from garfield were noticeably similar . about <NUM> students made the same exact errors on one particular problem , and that is what made ets suspicious . so once again , a well done film , and while is it `` based on a true story '' , it is far from a true story
look , it 's not that i do n't like the outlaws , in fact i have much respect for them for bein loyal and true to pac , but to be quite honest , lyricly , they might be the worst group of rappers iv ' e ever heard in my life.the fact that this album went double platinum tells you everything you need to know about 2pac 's popularity more then anything else . okay hussein fatal ( who for some reason is n't even on the album ) was cool and kadafi ( r.i.p . ) was okay , but the rest of them , at best , were a little below average.i ca n't tell you how many pac songs they 've brought down because of their obvious lack of lyrical talent . with that being said , i really do think that this was a good album . the stand out tracks for me are `` mr.president '' , `` secrets of war '' ( pac comes off nice on this one.he also has an unreleased verse on this song ) , `` homeboys '' , `` the good die young '' , `` killuminati '' , `` hell for a hustler '' , '' baby do n't cry '' and `` tattoo tears '' . my favarite song on this album has to be `` hell for a hustler '' . pac 's rage and emotion on this song is unbelieveble . `` whatching over me threw every murder scene '' `` guess you can call me anti-social , n * * * * z shaken like they caught the holy ghost when i approach you '' . bottom line , if your a fan of 2pac then you should probably snatch this album up because pac 's lyrics on this album alone is worth the price even though he 's only rapping on 1-2 verses per song .
set the twilgiht reeling truely has every musical element . lou reed showcases his ability to produce beautiful meaningful and passionate songs and at the same time also keep a comedic tone . riptide alone reaches deep down inside you and touches your heart and soul . only new york , berlin and transformer almost match this level of quality . hooky wooky , trade in , adventurer , finish line , the title track , and hang onto your emotions are all fantastic . with great lyrics , well written songs and unsermountalbe passion , set the twilight reeling truely is one of the greatest albums ever made
during his lifetime somerset maugham ( 1874-1965 ) was best known for such novels as of human bondage and such plays as the circle ; today , however , he is chiefly recalled for his short stories , of which the <NUM> `` miss thompson '' is easily the most famous . the original story was soon adapted for the stage under the title rain -- and it was a tremendous success . the play has been performed countless times and continues to be revived on a consistent basis ; there have also been three major screen adaptations . the best of these is the <NUM> silent film sadie thompson starring gloria swanson ( 1897-1983 . ) swanson was perhaps the first hollywood `` diva , '' an actress as controversial as she was popular . by the late 1920s her liaison with the infamous joe kennedy ( father of john , robert , and ted ) gave her the clout to become her own producer , and with kennedy money behind her she selected the maugham story and cast herself in the title role . it was an inspired choice . swanson had somewhat hard features and tremendous attitude , and many consider that this is her best overall performance . the story concerns the collision of a brash prostitute ( swanson ) and a holier-than-thou minister ( lionel barrymore ) who find themselves trapped by quarantine and monsoon rains in a rundown hotel on pago-pago . needless to say , the sparks fly -- especially when davidson pressures the island govenor to deport sadie as soon as possible . but it gradually transpires that davidson may have more than one reason for wanting sadie gone : it may be that he finds her a temptation himself . sadie thompson would be swanson 's last great success in the silent era -- the later queen kelly was never finished or widely released . but like most other silent films , it was buried by the advent of sound , and over the years the final ten or fifteen minutes of the film was completely lost . without a conclusion , it was rarely shown even after interest in silent films revived . fortunately , kino has been able to restore the conclusion with a mixture of film fragments , stills , and title card recreations , and the brazen sadie , the dour dr. davidson , and the statement made about intolerance , tempation , and hypocrisy live and breathe once more . the picture quality shows age , but on the whole it is quite good and probably the best available short of digital restoration . the bonuses are slight but interesting , including comparisons of key scenes from the original story , the playscript , the <NUM> swanson version , and the <NUM> joan crawford version , which was titled rain . ( comparison with the <NUM> rita hayworth version , titled miss sadie thompson , is not made ; this version , however , is negligable . ) kino video has done a tremendous job of restoring , preserving , and once more making this memorable film available . if you 're a fan of maugham , swanson , or silent film in general , sadie thompson is a must-have . gft , amazon reviewe
this is a beautiful book . it is reminiscent of the images and style of children 's books published at the time when disney originally released sleeping beauty . this is a real tribute and a cherished edition to have from one of disney 's best and often overlooked fairy tale classics . it has a real place in my heart
dylan goes country and he does it well . this is a record far too short . good songs here , but not enough of them . it seems like you 've just put the cd in the player and it 's over . but other than the fact that there is n't as much music here as on a normal dylan cd , i have no complaints . dylan is in fine voice here , sort of a country , high pitched twang that works very nicely . he tells these songs of love and loss with such sincerity , such honesty . but then he attacks everything he does that way , so it should be no surprise . this is just a wonderful , if a bit too short , record
as a talk show host i am accustom to being inundated with requests from pr folks trying to get me to book their particular client on my show to plug their book . since i did n't like my current events show to be a blatant advertisement for a writer , i generally delete these types of solicitation ... <NUM> times a day . in fact i had hit delete on the email regarding chris prentiss 's book just as my eye caught a phrase and i had to actually retrieve the message . it was the cure rate of better than <NUM> % that got my attention , and triggered my skepticism ... along with a tiny sliver of hope since i knew how many times friends and members of my own family had fallen off the wagon . i booked chris for <NUM> minutes and they sent me the book . a few days beforehand i thought i better skim the book so i could ask him some tough questions . i read the entire book and called the pr representative back and booked chris for the entire show . i think what hooked me was chris 's comment about observing an aa meeting where people were ` white knuckling their way through sobriety '' . controversial statement . and true for too many . the book was specific about the path . find the underlying cause ( s ) . work on that . the true story of his son 's journey was engaging and encouraging . for weeks and months after the show i received emails and phone calls from listeners : `` what was the name of that guy again ? what 's the name of his book ? '' of all the shows and topics i have covered in <NUM> years on air , i have never received such a response .
i 'm not sure what film frankie flanagan , ross hughes , ' a viewer ' , breandan or elizabeth j. shannon were commenting on , but it does n't seem possible that it was 'bloody sunday ' . ms. shannon , ross hughes and ' a viewer ' seem to think that the film is pro-ira - boy , did they miss the point . as for abe `` starman '' in wva , clearly he does n't even understand the basic facts behind the film . as for roland zwick and gitana3000 , i think they need to gain some experience in accented english . the northern irish dialect is not that hard to understand . heck , go and see a movie set in yorkshire , glasgow or durham - those are difficult accents . it 's a fact of modern realistic filmmaking that when a film is set in northern ireland it 's going to feature northern irish accents - it 's something everyone should be able to deal with . heck , i found the movie 'matewan ' difficult to understand , but i do n't demand subtitles , or that they tone down the accents , for a movie that 's in my own language . instead i learn to understand the variations - it 's not that difficult , and it 's something that stands a person in good stead when he ventures out into the real world . only in us documentaries and news shows do we see subtitles when people are speaking clear and intelligable english . what is it with that ? i mean do people in new york need subtitles when listening to folks from north dakota ? anyway , rant over . this is a great film which gives bloody sunday very evenhanded treatment . perhaps if people saw the film before commenting , and perhaps if they took the time to understand the film before they started to write a review , this film would get fairer reviews . as others here have said , do n't see this movie and think it gives an overview of 'the troubles ' because it does n't . it shows one day when one group of soldiers killed a lot of innocent people - as such it illustrates how poor armies are at keeping the peace - it shows how the british army killed a few of the <NUM> people it killed during 'the troubles ' . what it does n't show is how brutal the ira , inla & other so-called 'republicans ' ( who killed <NUM> people ) or the loyalists ( who killed <NUM> ) can be
this is a gently heartbreaking film set in tehran , a city flooded with afghan refugees during the time of taliban rule in their homeland . it touches on several themes , including the plight of the refugees , and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry . much of the story takes place at a construction site , where the central character , a young iranian , a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen , gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father , injured at the work site . the young man 's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl , and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family . though they never exchange a word in the film , she leaves a deep impression on him , and he is utterly changed by his experience . a story that is about the transformation of character , the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process , often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines , wordlessly ponders his situation , or goes in search of the girl and her family . director magid magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men , the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them , and the unforgiving weather ( snow , rain , cold ) in which they all labor . recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media
michael buble is phenomenal . song number <NUM> home is a choker-upper at our houses , but we all love it and sing it out loud . right now our family is separated by miles - but not for too much longer - the cd has tremendous sentimental value in our homes already and we will still be singing it i 'm sure when we are all reunited again
eve and roarke fans will love this selection ! ! ! ! the last chapter had me holding my ribs in laughter ! as usual eve works to exhaustion . although the mysteries , i agree with other posts , were transparent , it will not disappoint diehard fans ! ! ! this series continues to surprise me that it still has so much life left in it ! bravo jd robb
the subtitle of the book , `` the friendship that won the civil war '' would imply that there really was a friendship , and indeed it seems the relationship between grant and sherman was destined to create a winning duo . that makes it unique , not just because of the resultant union victory , but it really does stand out as the one relationship among the senior leadership of both sides that was capable of creating the kind of synergism necessary to win the struggle . the only other comparable relationship was lee and jackson , which was every bit as successful , but did n't survive the war . there are too many anectdotes in the book to mention , but i can say that i learned a lot more than i had previously gleened from separate biographies . grant was clearly a victim of disappointing performances by subordinates , sherman being a glowing exception . and sherman 's armies needed the type of visionary leadership that ultimately unleashed them to win . yet the contingent nature of the events leading to the monumental victories are pointed out again and again . such were the nature of promotions and military politics in the day . a fast paced read . the relatively quick descriptions of the battles are much appreciated . if grant and sherman seemed like inspiring characters before , hood 's book will convince you that the story of their friendship not only won the war , but had a profound impact on 19th century america well beyond <NUM>
book # <NUM> in the in death series . this book had the potential to be the best in the series . but eve 's ever increasing sensitivity issues made ruined it 's perfection . as the swisher family is brutally murdered in their sleep , their is a lone survivor and witness , their young daughter nixie . in the beginning eve embraces the child reluctantly when she finds her in the home hiding . you feel eve can relate to her terror . then when eve brings the child into her home to protect her , she does everything she can to alienate the kid . come on ! i thought eve was growing and then she takes a giant leap back . it was just a little to over the top for me . too much lack of compassion . thank goodness for raorke and sommerset . the mystery is top notch , and peabody is back on the job . i just wish eve would take some sensitivity classes . other than that another excellent book .
after reading all the reviews , i did not want to see this movie . i am glad i did . it is intelligent deceptive and pivotal . it 's no wonder all guys reviewed this film . previous comments only promised sex and young flesh and sex and old flesh . the content is immeasurable . one viewer stated do n't read the reviews . do not . especially those written by horny loners . excellent movie
i consider myself goth , even though i generally have to keep it hidden . i only mention this because i expected to really love this immediately ! i was disappointed when i did n't fall for it right off the bat , but i did myself a supreme favor by watching it again . this is a jewel and has a lot to offer , but the caveat is that it might not be instantly accessible . that 's good , though , right ? ? who wants the same rehashed stuff over and over ? my initial disappointments were , first , that the music was n't `` belly dance traditional '' and in some cases not even belly dance at all , but it was just an expectations problem . the music on this dvd ranges from modern arabic percussion/synth/vocal and modern ethnic/ modern bellydance to modern urban/ modern urban bellydance and techno . my second disappointment was that the dancers ' movements were unexpectedly slow , so that after the first <NUM> or <NUM> pieces i was so bored that i started fast-forwarding and then gave up completely . it turned out i needed a bit of time to `` recalibrate '' myself ! when i purchased this dvd , i had never seen rachel brice or sharon kihara perform yet , and did not know anything about the tribal style or what to expect from goth bellydancing . if you are looking for strictly bellydancing , you should know that i would label <NUM> of the <NUM> pieces such . i would label <NUM> as a blend of belly and modern , <NUM> as strictly modern , and <NUM> as a pretty worthless music video trashy piece . some specifics : ariellah is very engaging and talented , very enjoyable to watch , with excellent taste in costuming . her pieces are my favorites . i also enjoyed asharah 's dances and costumes . she is talented and only slightly less engaging than ariellah . ayshe 's work to me is heavy on atmospherics and drama , with more gymnastics , jazz , and ballet than bellydance . blanca exudes confidence but her dancing ability was hard to gauge because most of what dancing there is reminds me of what would be done in a go-go cage . the piece , which cuts between <NUM> locations and outfits , is visually a pretty piece nonetheless . jehan 's piece is too overtly sexual and , frankly , silly to me . her buttocks are barely hidden behind filmy fabric in some shots , and she writhes on the floor in others . more like a music video than anything else . neon 's piece `` deja vu '' at least has bellydancing in it , but is also very mtv . her costume is very cool , as is her nordic queen look and extensive tribal tattooing . there are <NUM> duets . one i have labeled `` goth bellydance meets riverdance '' with a touch of martial arts . it is very charmingly performed and entertaining , even funny at first , and the costumes are very pretty . this duet and one solo have knives in them , and one other duet begins as a mock execution with one of the women wielding a large sword . it took a couple views to begin warming up to that one . all this said , i strongly recommend this dvd . the women are mostly talented , many of the dances are creative and different , and the costuming is interesting and lovely in almost all cases . in addition , as someone herself learning bellydancing , i feel the camera work is very good . i was never annoyed by it , nor did i ever have trouble understanding what the dancers were doing . my only complaint is that i would wish to see the costumes in even greater detail because i am working on designing one or two for myself , but more light would , of course , have ruined the atmospherics . : ) in summary , i 'd venture that only the very jaded or very midwestern will be disappointed if you give this an honest chance . blink your eyes . rub them . walk away . come back another day and watch it again . this dvd seems glacially slow the first time you see it , compared to the usual , more frenetic belly dancing we 've all seen . as inexpensive as it is , i strongly suggest taking a chance on it if you like goth fashion/ colors/ atmospherics and various bellydance forms , such as the tribal style and other modern styles . i 'm very happy with it
i just ordered this cd and can not wait to get it i have listened to all of the samples and there is not one song that i do not like i believe this guy is going to go very far . i love is song good morning beautiful . i have always been a very big fan of vince gill now this guy is rating right up there with vince ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so thanks for comming to the country scene your going to go very far
in this detailed and well-researched account , psychologist robert j. lifton chronicles the holocaust from a unique perspective : the role played by nazi medical doctors . in doing so he explains the nazi philosophy that formed the basis for mass murder : the necessity to heal the ills of german society by eliminating all its corrupting influences . healing was and is the raison d'etre for the medical profession . doctors were thus compelled to become killers in the application of this all encompassing `` cure . '' lifton traces the evolution of the holocaust beginning with the `` euthanasia '' projects of the <NUM> 's . anyone incapable of being a productive member of society was consided , `` life unworthy of life '' and euthanized . initially this was confined to the mentally challenged and the old/infirmed . later even severely wounded german soldiers were not spared . execution technology perfected here formed the basis for the mass executions conducted later . lifton interviews many physicians in this work including some former nazi 's and many jewish doctors forced to work at auschwitz . here , the inner conflicts of persons trained to heal but actively involved in killing reached its apex . reactions varied from the cold , view of inmates as `` laboratory rats '' and nothing more by josef mengele , to the tortured acceptance of the necessity of doing his duty of eduard wirths . coping mechanisms included sending others to do the `` dirty work '' when possible , excessive use of alcohol , and in some cases , suicide . still , the work went on , despite any internal contradictions . this is the first work i have seen that explained the nazi philosophy and its impact on the holocaust . because it was the stated goal of national socialism to cleanse german society of all its ills , the participation of healers was essential . the nazi 's never wavered in this twisted belief . would the holocaust have occurred without the doctor 's participation ? undoubtedly , yes ! however doe 's this excuse their participation ? you the reader must decide . a great read . five stars ! ! harold y. grooms
yes , it is missing some good songs from elo ( i would 've like to see all over the world from xanadu on here and rockaria , my favorite elo song , among others ) . but this is a greatest hits album , not a 'all the good songs from elo ' album . this is n't for die hard fans , it 's for casual fans who heard a few songs on the radio and want a greatest hits album to hear some other tunes . the songs on here are great and will probably influence them to buy elo 's other full length albums .
i really enjoyed this dvd ........ i recently bought the recent release of the ritual path after seeing some clips on nijole sparkis and fritz heede 's my space pages and really enjoyed the images and music so i thought i would give the illuminated manuscripts a try . i really thought it was well done and would have enjoyed it just for the music . i guess it depends on what you are looking for as to weather or not you will like it . i watched on a regular tv with a $ <NUM> dvd player and thought it was great . someone else may watch on a $ 10,000 tv and system and may still not be impressed . i looked at another dvd review that was mentioned and highly recommended by someone that did n't like this one , yet that dvd only had <NUM> reviews and not good .. so just a matter of taste and perhaps the digital age has made it very hard to impress a person . i feel the dvd does what it was meant to do , provide some relaxing music with some wonderful scenes , perhaps the title illuminated manuscripts explains the writings and emblems that appear in the video . perhaps if you are able to watch some clips you will know if it 's for you or even check out the more recent ritual path . i come from a rock music background and do n't feel that i 'm easily impressed but from my personal viewing i would recommend both the illuminated manuscripts or the ritual path . it 's been awhile since i have seen some of the other animated clips mentioned in some of the reviews here and admit some of what i remember they were great , but these do what they were meant to do just like chronos did years ago without the animation ....
dr. dichter gives a wide range of examples based on real experiences that expose many of the pitfalls of development assistance as we know it . unfortunately , while his descriptions of the problems are quite comprehensive , his proposed solution ( i.e . drastically cut development assistance in favor of private development ) lacks much in the way of logical support . for instance , there is no contrasting presentation of examples of privately-funded projects that have succeeded where charity has failed , nor any mention of to what extent business relies on government-funded infrastructure improvements , etc . in addition , the topic is best addressed in two stages -- i.e. , is it desirable to encourage development in other countries ? and , if so , are our current tactics the most effective and efficient ways to achieve this goal ? dr. dichter addresses only the second question , but seems to conclude that because the status quo is ineffective , the entire pursuit should be abandoned . but in general the book is still highly worth reading if you 're the least bit interested in development assistance -- it is both deeply enlightening and generally accessible .
this is a great book . it not only gives a feel for life after the end of the show ds9 , but very creatively incorporates the time frames and characters from the eras of dax 's previous hosts . e.g . bomes makes an appearance . highly recommended if you loved the dax character , or star trek in general
bird , is a film about the life of jazz great charlie `` the bird '' parker . forest whitaker is doing a great job as charlie parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life , except one is lead to believe that `` chan '' was his wife ( in real life , she was n't ) . one negative thing i felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film . i think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance . another critisism is for a film about charlie parker , his talent on improvisation , his creativity could have been , and should have been emphasized more . there is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning , charlie does n't even remember the piece , or even the conversation that took place . this is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation . in real life , charlie parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time , with some additions here and there , givin it a new mood , new angle , new taste . this could have been shown . however , despite these minor shortcomings , i think the film is a very good one . for charlie parker fans , i also strongly suggest the book `` bird lives '' by ross russell
my big fat greek wedding is a great movie ! my mother loved it when we saw it in theaters , and i got it for her for christmas and she still loves it . great movie
this is the true account of a spy by the name of virgina hall who very little is known about and even though she had a wooden leg she was an american spy during world <NUM> working first for the british and thean the americans deep behind german lines she saved many allied lifes , destroyed countless german trains and lead many freedom fighters on countless raids agaist nazi forces . for her bravery she was decorated by both the american and british goverment . the arthur judith l. pearson has interviewed and tracked down many formor freedom fighters who have shared there memorys of mrs halls world war <NUM> experiences and this remarkable writer has also traveled to the exact locations were this freedom fighter was and has for the first time got access to some real one of a kind records on the life of this very special spy . it was amazing to me that this spy accomplished all of these many things with a wooden leg . this book would really make a special gift for a friend , family member and or soldier serving over seas
finally , , this book was just what i have been looking for . i 've been diligently searching for information on how my lesbianism would effect my daughter and the sterile studies i found just did n't seem to satisfy my quest . i found comfort from this book and in knowing who she becomes depends on all the factors of parenting and not just the fact that i 'm a lesbian . this collection outweighs the studies because the honesty of the writers provided rare and precious information . i hope volume two is in the works and perhaps we will hear from some more artificial insemination babies . thanks to the writers and editors for letting these voices be heard loud and proud
i just completed three viewings of the anchor bay release of this movie ... i was stunnded & awestruck at the sheer beauty of this dvd . every scene was carefully composed to show off the greatest beauty possible ... pure eye candy . the colors were bright and crisp and well defined . the sound quality was superb . one rarelly finds this perfection in this old of a movie
the best interpretation of this piano concerto i have ever heard . smooth , silky and precise , this is super pianomanship
do n't let a few bad reviews fool you ! this is easily one of the best albums out there ! there 's not a bad song in the bunch ! and courtney jaye is easily one of best and most original singer/songwriters around also ! and she 's worked with some of the best in the business to create this musical masterpiece ! this is nothing like the average pop music you hear , it has more of a hawaiian sound on some songs , i noticed that the first time i heard it ! she calls it rootsy/exotic/alt/pop on her myspace page ! that 's one of the things i like most about the album ! plus the songs are all so fun , catchy , and dreamy , and she has such a great singing voice , i just ca n't get enough of it ! and there 's something for everyone to like ! i really love all of the songs so much ! but if i had to pick any favorites probably '' time for goodbye '' `` this is the day '' `` love me '' and `` hanalei road '' to name a few ! so please buy this album and listen to the whole thing , with an open mind , and listen more than once ! if you 're anything like me and really like great music that 's different than the usual dull boring music you 're used to hearing , i know you 'll love it as much as i do ! courtney jaye is one very talented artist that has real staying power ! she 's already finished her next album so that 's proof of that ! and from what i 've heard of it , it 's great also ! i know she certainly has a life long fan in me !
this is one of the better albums of c.w.mccall 's tunes . i 've been looking for years for a copy of the wolf creek pass album . i have it on a worn out 8-track and ca n't seem to locate it anywhere else . with songs like nite rider , old sloan , classified , 4-wheel drive , old thirty and more . this one will serve as a substitute till i can find one
a wonderful portrait of the dashing , romantic columbo . virtually forgotten for the last half-century , columbo was as popular as bing crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor rudolph valentino . but at age <NUM> , he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident , ending one of the most promising careers in music and film . columbo was the archetypal 1930s `` crooner , '' who gave `` an impression of emotional restraint , of power in reserve . '' despite the co-author credit , the book was in fact written by lanza , a master wordsmith ( and author of elevator music , the cocktail , and gravity ) . penna supplied the copious archival photographs , letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text . lanza , who calls columbo `` an enigma wrapped inside a press release , '' treats his subject with respect , yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography . columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled , flawed , ambivalent , and stubborn , and lanza makes no excuses for him . at the same time , the chronology is authoritative , and there 's abundant humor , even when considering columbo 's inner torment ( referring to columbo 's pet name for his adored carole lombard , lanza refers to the singer 's despair at not getting enough `` quality pookie time '' ) . lanza describing columbo emerging from a swimming pool : `` ... a sight no less mythical than venus rising from her half-shell . his dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair , the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator . '' such vivid images tantalize on every page , but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness ; it represents solid , well-researched journalism . columbo 's love letters to lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation , demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans can not allay unrequited passion . an excellent read , and the cast of characters are richly drawn
lester young.what more can i say ? he was the most incredible jazz player of all times . the king of tenor saxophone.he recorded this session in <NUM> , three years before his death , with some outstanding companions : teddy wilson , vic dickenson , roy eldridge , freddie greene , gene ramey and jo jones.what a hall of fame ! ! just listen to the magnificent version of `` i 'll guess i 'll have to change my plan '' , a tune rarely recorded.this is some of the greatest lester , a real masterpiece ; for lester 's playing , but also for teddy wilson , jo jones , and for an amazing roy eldridge.i guess you 'll play this tune for hours.roy 's solo on this tune ranks among the greatest things ever done on a trumpet.the four other tunes are very great moments of music too : lester 's improvisations on `` i did n't know what time it was '' or `` this year 's kisses '' , a tune he recorded with billie holiday some <NUM> years before.the jazz giants is a good title : noone will ever play that way
snoop dogg is one of my favorite rappers . i 've grown up listening to him since i was a child while he was rhyming on dr. dre 's `` the chronic '' . i 've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums ( `` the game is sold ... '' ) and when he dropped a decent album ( `` paid the cost ... '' ) . `` the blue carpet treatment '' would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me . this album is full of laced beats and good rhymes . `` think about it '' comes off real strong from snoop laced with a dope beat . the radio hit `` thats that ... '' with r. kelly gives listeners a nice r & b tune to listen to . as well as the other hit `` i wan na love you '' with akon , another hit for this album . as i said in my title , this is what `` cali iz active '' should have sounded like . that cd was so horrible and failed to follow it 's concept . this album followed what that concept should have been . most of the guest appearances are form cali . `` candy '' would feature goldie loc , mc eiht , e-40 , and the dogg pound , and a real nice tune to ride to . `` lax '' with ice cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from biggie 's `` going back to cali '' in the hook . i 'd say for some reason , my favorite song is toward the end with `` imagine '' with dr. dre . and d'angelo . possibly because that piano laced throughout the song . snoop would close the album with `` conversations '' with stevie wonder , showing off that he 's trying to get his mind right . other guests include the game , b-real from cypress hill , george clinton , and kam ( where the hell have you been kam ? ? ? ) . although this is a good cd i 've heard from snoop in a minute , it still has some rough parts . `` <NUM> lil ' crips '' sounded kinda weak to me . and i was n't feeling the song `` beatin ' up on yo pads '' although it 's a positive song about him coaching and playing football , but it 's a good song , so i 'll make it my honorable mention track . if you heard that this album was his most consistant since `` doggystyle '' , you heard correct . we 're more than aware that he 's not going to drop another one of those albums , but this is a real good one from snoop . if other west coast artists drop albums like this , we might have the west coast making a comeback . and being a fan of west coast rap music , i am more than ready for it . if you thought snoop fell off , well he gives doubters `` tha blue carpet treatment '' . lyrics : a- production : a- guest appearances : a- musical vibes : b overall : a- my favorite tracks from this album : think about it , thats that ... , candy ( drippin ' like water ) , gangbangn <NUM> , lax , which one of you , i wan na [ love ] you , psst ! , imagine , converstions honorable mention track : beatin ' on yo pads peace everyone ! !
this was my first diskworld novel and i was blown away - the characters and story are both real and entertaining and it 's hilariously well-written .
this dvd has been taken from a early-forties era documentary film made with stateside audiences in mind . it was probably shown in theaters before the main shows during the war years . one of the big pluses is that the film is in color , and that the color is strikingly good for a combat film . directed by academy award winner william wyler ( best known for 'ben-hur ' and the original documentary of 'the memphis belle ' ) , the film depicts life -- and death -- in a p-47 thunderbolt squadron based in italy . it gives the viewer a good look at italy , not just the base itself . the strafing runs are excellent , taken by a camera mounted in the planes on actual missions . for a wartime propaganda film , it is quite honest and deals with the suffering of noncombatants , showing bombed-out buildings , children playing near a burned corpse , and haggard , war-weary men and women . the aerial footage is excellent , the dialogue is good , and the quality of the picture is also good . the film also shows the tragic results of a thunderbolt crash quite graphically , as if to remind the viewer that war is a dangerous game and that there is never any guarantee that the pilots will return from their missions . this color film runs around <NUM> minutes . it is well worth the price
this cd is great for the entire family . the songs are catchy and it 's not a big deal if you 're caught singing them around strangers !
a true fan of pokemon would enjoy this movie . it is now my two son's favorite of all the pokemon movies in their collection of movies
van go gan is excellent . i 'd been waiting many months to recieve this cd and was thrilled and surprised once it arrived . every song is strong in it 's arrangements and vocals . in my estimation every track is interesting but with `` kiss life '' , `` international '' , `` sunrise sunset '' being standouts . this cd also contains a unique spin on `` now sue '' and never get tired of hearing `` i need you '' which has interesting harmonies and background vocals . as one reviewer stated some songs are simple and uncluttered , it 's just the vocals and a guitar done acoustically . this cd is always in rotation in my player and highly recommended
after that wham ! broke up it was almost inevitable that george michael would become a solo star , he had already had a solo hit with `` careless whisper '' `` a diffrent corner '' and his duet with aretha franklin `` i know you were waiting '' was also a hit . `` faith '' was released in <NUM> and it also sold around <NUM> millions copies , it was without a doubt george 's most comercially succesful album . `` faith '' shows maturity but it also continues with catchy uptempo songs that wham ! were famous for , it 's a great mix between effective soul-pop like the title track and slow personal ballads like `` father figure '' . it also had a great streak of <NUM> # <NUM> hits on the billboard charts . george also became the first white male artist to reach # <NUM> at the r & b charts . first single `` faith '' is a catchy uptempo that almost became a trademark for him . it starts with a face-up organ for most of the song but eventually a one-chord guitar is introduced too . it 's a hell of a song . `` father figure '' is a far more moody song , infact it 's a soulish ballad that feautures gospel choirs and a somewhat mysterious sound . both faith and father figure were # <NUM> hits . `` i want you sex l & ll '' is indeed <NUM> diffrent version of the song , it 's <NUM> minutes long . the first one is soul-pop but the second in more retro-soul with horns , something that phil collins would have been proud of . the song was considered very controvercial upon it 's release , both the title and the lyrics were offensive to many people and the song was banned from certain stations and would only be played at late night on mtv . the song was a # <NUM> hit in us nonetheless . `` one more try '' is a touching ballad about a man not willing to get into a new relationshiop cause he had been hurt so many times before . it was his 4th # <NUM> hit from `` faith '' . `` hard day '' was never released on single but would have become a hit too i think . it 's a uptempo song that reminds me of `` i want your sex '' . `` hand to mouth '' was also a non-single , it a great touching slow paced song about the american dream . it tells the story of <NUM> diffrent people that both want to experience the american dream , but none succeeds one shoots at people and the other one ends up becoming a prostitute . critizism to reagan 's america , simular to the recent single `` shoot the dog '' towards bush . `` look at your hands '' is a jazzy song that also brings up social issues , this time domestic violence . `` monkey '' is a catchy uptempo aswell , it was his 5th # <NUM> hit and it 's not hard to understand why . the ballad `` kissing a fool '' only reached # <NUM> and was the last single from this album . it sound alot like the upcoming material he was going to release later on . the upcoming song are remix of `` hard day '' and the last one being a third version of `` i want your sex '' this one is very slow paced though . overall , a great solo debut for george that not only sold incredibly well but also is flawless from song <NUM> to song <NUM> . all songs are worthwile , and he makes a good mix of catchy uptempo 's to touching ballads . a <NUM> 's classic without a doubt
this is a brilliant film , about a woman whose life is shattered , first by untimely death and then but the discovery of betrayal . this is te best film of the trilogy by far , with outstanding performances by binoche and others . this is a real woman , who suffers and learns to renew herself , through art and love . i was deeply moved by this film , totally drawn in
i 'm a huge fan of <NUM> , <NUM> , and <NUM> but this movie just gives me everything i want -- -- -- great acting , great fights , good sets , great stunts , and the best score ever . my only <NUM> problems with this movie are the americans being portrayed incorrectly and no yuen biao showing his true skills . i mean yuen biou is no jet but he is better than <NUM> % of movie martial artists . but , jet is in full form and only in fist of legend wil you see anything close to that you are seeing this . also the baddie ( who is not a bad guy , just more fo an opponent for jet ) in this movie has n't looked this good since shadow ninja . i have seen this edition and it is the full <NUM> min . with a decent ric myers commentary
as you would expect from oxford , this is a very well done edition of the play , with a comprehensive introduction ( though i wished for a little more theatre history myself ) that covers the major issues in this `` problem '' comedy ( though it is not nearly so much a problem play as , say , troilus and cressida , in fact being much closer in many ways to measure for measure ) , several textual appendices , an index , useful textual- and foot-notes ( there seem to be a great many phrasings in this play that need explanation -- a result of revision ? ) , and two of shakespeare 's direct sources in erasmus and painter . there were a few points when i disagreed with the interpreations offered in the footnotes , but overall , the apparatus is excellent . as for the play itself , the main action concerns the efforts of helen to recapture her husband bertram , who is given to her by the king as a reward for curing his fistula . he does not think she , as a physician 's daughter , is worthy of his station and flees to the wars in italy without consumating the marriage . the comic subplot involves the exposure of the cowardice of his companion , paroles . helen evnetually fulfills the requirements bertram sets out in a letter -- to obtain his ring and bear a child by him -- through a bed trick , and the play ends where it began , with the king ( echoes of lear ? ) offering diana , who helped in the trick , her choice of husband . overall , a very good edition of a less popular play .
nicholas reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music ... a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to keep you moving ! !
i received my item very promptly and am very pleased with the dvd . thanks - would recommend this dvd . one of the best for eddie murphy
tisha campbell is a underrated actress with a big beautiful singing voice . while america gives these bitches like ashanti , britney , hilary and lindsay the limelight and pass on tisha ! not right yall ! every song on this album is slamming . capitol should have done a better job promoting this wonderful album . `` push '' is a funky track which enlisted the help of tichina arnold on backgrounds . `` all good things come in time '' is a quiet storm classic song . `` brokenhearted '' is a slice of perfect pitch heaven . `` love 's got a hold on me '' is a sexy slow number that captivates any ole heart . so in parting , the next time somebody complains about not any real singers , cop this album . how does america think that britney , ashanti , hillary and lindsay have vocal talents ? i have britney & ashanti . these girls need to go to vocal camp and learn a thing or two from ms. campbell martin . these girls could n't hold a candle next to tisha 's four octaves . think about that , the next time yall complain about no talent girls
this cd is a great collection of early to recent more early van morrison . i bought the album primairly for the song `` cleaning windows '' , but foung many more favorits on this album after purchasing it
`` the who sell out '' is one among ( at least <NUM> ) several who master pieces . with its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting , the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining who album . <NUM> was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the who were among the pioneers of that trend . this is obvious from the first track of the album `` armenia in the sky '' . the outstanding single `` i can see for miles '' is among the very best psychelia songs recorded . the acoustic `` mary anne with the shaky hand '' is another who favourite - beautiful melody , great rhythm and intelligent lyrics . actually the lyrics are overall great on this album - with wit and homour . songs like `` odorono '' and `` tattoo '' are rarely included on who compilations - and they 're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album . `` our love was '' and `` i ca n't reach '' are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album `` a quick one '' . i might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case . these short tracks works great in the context of the album . only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place . townshend 's acoustic `` sunrise '' is quite beautiful , but `` rael '' feels somewhat longwinded and dated . most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format . try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals .
loved this movie~ rather refreshing to see <NUM> filmakers work on one film using tim roth as the bellhop who was just fabulous~ chapter <NUM> certainly threw me off guard : ) its a keeper in the collection dark humor comedy
the title of this movie refers to the widow mrs. henderson , a rich member of england 's upper crust at the beginning of wwii . having lost a husband years earlier , and a son to wwi , she needs something to do , and so buys the windmill theater in london . pouring her money into it and pulling some political strings , she turns it into a first class theater that runs shows with young , beautiful , nude women in it . her aim , to entertain young english lads before they are sent of to war . this she does , but various tragedies strike along the way , such as one of her `` actresses '' getting pregnant by a married soldier . this dvd set includes several features , one of which is the story of the real theater and interviews with actual actresses who worked there . yes , this movie is based on real-life events and people , and it seems the producers went out of the way to make the movie as historically true as possible . all in all , this movie is a great combination of history , tragedy , and comedy , and worth watching
this disc is merely further proof of what the world already knows . yo yo ma was in fact born to play the cello , it is simply fantastic . it is a must own for me , it feels the air around you with such wonderful tones . although some classical snobs might complain that this is nothing more than a pseudo classical album , who cares . they should find the nearest emergency room and have someone remove the poles from thier * sses . no apologizes are needed hear , this disc is all that it needs to be , which is absolutely magnificient ....... peace : the * hot * wax * ki
if i were to rate the packaging , i would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made , i 've had the discs fall out several times myself . but it 's a beautifully packaged and recorded document ( in its appearance and sound ) that i listen to constantly . one problem i have when i look at the roster of talent , is i 'm reminded or our own mortality ; so many of these people are now dead , and the era that followed can never replace what was here . that could be good , though , they all sound so alive here , enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage . as an aside , i wonder why people call a death `` passing away , '' or just `` passing . '' they did n't `` pass , '' they died ; there 's no shame in saying it . richard manuel , rick danko , paul butterfield , muddy waters , carl radle , and pop staples are all dead ; go ahead , say it . i do n't think they 'll mind . nobody flinches at the word `` suicide '' when talking about richard manuel , but let rick danko peacefully drift off in his sleep , and he `` passes away . '' these things have always puzzled me . back to the music ; it 's all good , so much talent crossed that stage that night , the audience had a real treat . the band 's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics , and i understand the guys resenting robertson 's appropriation of the writing credits , but these are men who have definitely walked the walk , and because of that , they are certainly able to talk the talk . you can hear the heartbreak in rick danko 's delivery of `` it makes no difference , '' and the effects of the hard life in richard manuel 's voice in `` the shape i 'm in , '' and even more so in `` acadian driftwood . '' his voice here is hoarse and ragged and perfect . levon helm summed up manuel 's demons quite well in in the band 's `` authorized biography , '' and in his book , `` this wheel 's on fire . '' he said `` that 's between him and his higher power , and i 've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it . '' he is still shaken over it this many years later , you can see it in the video , because here , he just clams up , takes a big drag on his cigarette , and looks off somewhere into the distance . i can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends , and the knowledge that it will always hurt . this is relevant to `` the last waltz , '' because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys , from the beginning , all the way through , until huge success started to splinter that element . they were so good , and to watch this , knowing that these five will never grace a stage or studio in this form again , has the feeling of ending , of winding down , and being forced to say goodbye when you do n't want to say goodbye . even though the sequencing is out of order , and there were a few omissions from the show , it 's still a magnificent document of one of the greatest live performances of the era , one of the best
the title track `` mercy , mercy , mercy , '' alone , is enough reason to buy this album . this recording captures the electricity of this particular show to the extent that the listener may at points truly get a feeling like they 're sitting in the room with the band
i do n't mean not very good , i mean not as good as people say it is . i really do n't understand why people think zahn is so brilliant . zahn is an excellent storyteller , but honestly , he is n't a very good writer . the trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies . `` luke reaches for his lightsaber , and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on hoth and had to use the force to get his lightsaber from the snow . '' it 's not necessary , and i groaned every time zahn did it . james luceno knows how to make appropriate and timely references . zahn fails . i personally liked the specific technical jargon , but i 'm surprised that most other people did , too . the story , though , what can i say ? it 's a good story . grand admiral thrawn is the most awesome person i know . it was genuinely hard to be happy seeing the empire defeated this time around . i hated c'boath , but then again , you'te supposed to . the noghri are a fascinating creation and their story is followed all the way through . everyone we know from the movies are there with a role , and act appropriately , although you never get the feeling that you 've learned anything more about any existing character . new characters , like mara jade and talon kaarde , are superb additions to the saga . creating characters really is zahn 's strongest point , i feel . the books fall victim of being written before the prequels , and being early eu novels in general but that is no one 's fault , and the `` errors '' are reconciled easily enough . as a trilogy , it is consistent and drives towards a consistent goal throughout . one other thing about the story , and i think this is why so many people adore these books more than i think they deserve , is that it is epic . i have yet to read another star wars book or series that approaches the expanse and import of this trilogy . it really concerns a huge part of the star wars timeline , and as a story matches the significance of the movies themselves , unlike any other books . that does n't make these books the best books , most interesting , or best written , but i think it is that epic feeling that makes this series so popular , despite being unspectacular in several ways .
the most important question is simple and straight forward ; is this two disc edition of `` the green mile '' worth the upgrade ? yes . the three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director . while the previous edition released in <NUM> looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition . i suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve ( along with improvements in digital technology ) the look of the film . we get a terrific and informative commentary by writer/director frank darabont . unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene ( and the possibility of creating a `` director 's cut '' ) most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased . the two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process . it used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves all the trims . we also get a great <NUM> minute documentary on the challenges ( and fears ) that darabont faced in making another stephen king project . he was afraid that he would be seen only as a stephen king director ( or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now ) which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk . we also get tom hanks make up tests , michael duncan clark 's screen tests , the teaser trailer ( along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser ) , original theatrical trailer . we also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film . i would have liked a commentary from hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track ( although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although i doubt it would as valuable ) . nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $ <NUM> extra dollars this is the edition to get . i should point out that many retailers ( costco among them ) have this available for $ 9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain . reviw of the film below : `` the green mile '' the third film made by frank darabont from stephen king 's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to darabont 's version of `` shawkshank '' . based on the five short serial novels ( now available as a single novel ) published back in <NUM> . this marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace . it 's not that it is n't involving it is but the third act of the fil is where the film picks up its momentum . nominated for four academy awards ( including best picture ) this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from tom hanks in the lead . well worth picking up for fans of king 's work but , more importantly , for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality .
this volume is a must have golf psychology primer . it is clear , easy to understand , can be enjoyed by any level of golfer
as a devoted jigga fan , this album was everything and above what i expected . every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes . jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at nas ( takeover ) , radio cuts ( i.z.z.o ) , emotional wordplay ( song cry ) . highlights include `` girls , girls , girls '' , `` never change '' , and is topped off with `` renegade '' which in my opinion contains hip-hop 's greatest verse of the past <NUM> years by eminem . even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper . jay has been called commercial , but who ever says that ai n't listening .
what 's not to like about lightning in a bottle ? you can scarcely argue with its roster of talent . it features odetta , ruth brown , b.b . king , solomon burke , shamekia copeland , dr. john , , buddy guy , clarence `` gatemouth '' brown , honeyboy edwards , shamekia copeland , mavis staples , robert cray , keb mo , bonnie raitt ... the list goes on . natalie cole was bluesier than i ever would have imagined . as were steven tyler and joe perry of aerosmith . i 'd seen david johansen in his blues incarnation , so i was n't surprised by his transition from new york doll to buster poindexter to bluesman . also very good were some folks i 'd heard of , but had never heard : india.arie , angelique kidjo . i was n't as impressed by rapper chuck d. although his anti-war version of `` boom boom '' certainly had its heart in the right place . john fogerty 's version of `` midnight special , '' which he had recorded with ccr , did n't really bring anything new to the song , but it was pretty good . macy gray , doing `` hound dog , '' was better than i 'd expected too . i 've found her voice a little irritating on some of the songs i 've heard of hers , but it 's hard to go wrong with a straight ahead tune like `` hound dog . '' see it with someone you love . or alone .... but if you care about the blues as an art form , do see it
another great story in the world of dragonlance ! i was so sad at the end of the war of souls trilogy , as i thought it meant the end of the world of krynn for me ... i was wrong , and i celebrated the day i found out that margaret and tracy were writing prequels . however , after the star wars debacle , i was slightly concerned that this was going to be a `` phantom menace '' . i am glad to say it is not . this book takes place between autumn twilight and winters night , and revolves around riverwind 's evacuation of the slave of pax tharkas after the rebellion , and tanis , raistlin , sturm caramon , flint , and tas 's search for the hammer of kharas - used to make the dragonlances . this book focuses largely on flint , which awesome considering that he played a much diminished role for the majority of the series . flint leads the companions in the search and has to deal with the dwarven bureaucracy and xenophobia in thorbardin . compounding the difficulty is an especially clever and ambitious draconian who has fooled the world into thinking lord verminard still lives . i swear , fans of tas will love this book - as always he has some of the best lines and gets himself into the strangest situations . my only criticism , [ which is not aimed at the authors ] and one shared by many reviewers , is the abysmal editing . there were missing words , spelling errors , type-o 's and so forth . while this does not detract from the well-conceived plot , it does slow the natural flow of the read . hopefully the publishers will take an extra week for editing on the next instalment . anyhow , this was a great read for fans of the series ! relic11
i saw jon randall play live with emmy-lou harris in nottingham earlier in the year and was amazed by his angelic voice and his lovely songs . this cd is just wonderful and with some highly talented background singers helping him with bone achingly beautiful harmonies , you ca n't go wrong
my little thomas fan loves any of the thomas dvd 's , no matter how many times he watches them . they are his favorite and i do n't think that will change for a very long time . thomas provides great life lessons like sharing , caring , and friendship . they get a thumbs up from me as well !
it is almost impossible for any album on amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall <NUM> star rating , yet different class has managed to do just that . although pulp has several really good albums , this is their best in my opinion . it is n't just that the songs are musically compelling ; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex . when this album was first released in england it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation . critics declared it a masterpiece , and fans bought it in astonishing numbers . the album also is deceptively political , in that it features class difference in a large number of songs . there are many musical highlights on the album , but what i find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison , while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast . fans will always differ on their favorites , but few will question that the album starts off strongly with `` mis-shapes . '' `` i spy '' is one of my favorites on the album along with `` disco <NUM> , '' which follows it . `` sorted for e 's and wizz '' is another stunner . but seriously , all the songs on the disc are at least good , most are very good , and two or three are great . but the best of the bunch is unquestionably `` common people . '' `` common people '' is simply a great song on multiple levels . musically it is incredibly compelling , one of those tunes that once you hear it you ca n't get it out of your head , with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around . but this would merely make it a good song ; what makes it great is the story the song tells . an art school student is noticed by a fellow student , a rich girl from greece , who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people . there is a definite sexual come on , as she says that she wants `` to sleep with common people , like you . '' at this point you think you know where the song is going , to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all . but the song instantly takes you in a different tangent . what follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected . our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money , a notion she laughs at . at this point the song turns very serious and dark , as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair . he tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over , but to truly find out what it would be like to live like `` common people '' would mean learning what it means to have no choices , no outs , no control . he sings : you will never understand how it feels to live your life with no meaning or control so instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning , we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off . i know of no other song like it . pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs , but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites . it definitely goes onto my all time top <NUM> . there are four pulp albums that i think any serious music fan should own : his 'n ' hers , different class , this is hardcore , and we love life . if one were bound and determined to own only one pulp album , one might go with hits , but this different class is so good that i just ca n't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well . trust me : if you do n't own this album you need to get it today . your ears will thank you
in phineas finn , anthony trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young irish member of parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the liberal government . a dispute with his party regarding the irish question , however , results in his leaving politics and returning to ireland . phineas redux brings phineas back , but the slogging is now harder . the vicious infighting between daubeny ( disraeli ) and gresham ( gladstone ) has soured phineas somewhat . he is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named quintus slide ; and many in his party , including some of his friends , believe that the irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with lady laura kennedy . at one point , the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at phineas , but misses . matters turn still darker when j. bonteen , a political rival to phineas , is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with phineas at the universe club . the major set piece of phineas redux is the trial of phineas finn for the murder of bonteen . opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until mme max goesler , whose love finn had rejected in the earlier volume , conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal . if trollope were a lesser author , everything at this point would be all sweetness and light . here , however , phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether . what trollope presents us with is an updated version of the book of job , with the difference that phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses . his good friends rally round the young m.p . and slowly wean him from his depression . the pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is mme max . phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted
blue rodeo , out of canada where they are rightfully gods , continues to fly under the us radar ... what a shame , especially when one stacks blue rodeo against lesser talents . `` <NUM> days in july '' is the gemstone of this richly talented group . combining elements of the eagles , the byrds , poco , the flying burrito brothers , twinges of psychedellic memories , <NUM> 's style chord work * which comes off very nice * and at times , vocal harmonies which bring a sweet hint of the everly brothers , this group , which can rock with the best or slow it down to a nice mellow , has a sound of their own . at once , the lyrics are memorable and catchy . the vocalists , cuddy and keelor , each bring their own qualities which never grow old with cuddy having impressive range while keelor brings at times , a nice raspiness with a clever edge . `` bad timing '' , one of the great tunes off this gem , would soar on the country charts if given a chance . with the exception of `` til i gain control again '' * brilliantly covered earlier by crsytal gayle and later by willie nelson * , all the tunes are penned by cuddy and keelor , as are their efforts on other blue rodeo albums . i had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at the ramshead tavern in annapolis , maryland . they did not disappoint . if you 're looking for great music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio , this is a must ! i would also suggest their dvd , `` burning snowmen '' , which chronicles them over time . if you can , find a way to one of their concerts ..
first generation of electronic sound , very relaxing , makes me return to good old times ....
the book `` a sense of duty : my father , my american journey '' is really an american story about coming of age and about father son relationships but with a huge twist of circumstances . we are dealing with a family torn apart by the loss of the vietnam war and their subsequent separation . author quang x. pham is shipped to the usa after the fall of saigon with his siblings and mother . his father who is a member of the south vietnamese air force stays behind doing his duty to the very end . thus begins <NUM> years of imprisonment in the so called `` re-education camps '' while his family adjusts to a new life in america . the author deals with cultural and language issues and some degree of racism and bigoted treatment . however , the deeper issue for him is not having his father there for him . there is also his lack , at that young age , to fully realize the significance of what his father had done with his life and how well he had served his old country . the book is an eye opener for those of us who have wondered what it was like for these new comers to our shores . when his father does come to the usa after being released from the `` camps '' he found it tough going . his marriage fell a part and he found that all those lost years with his children , who had grown up without him , haave created a huge gap between them . his children do not really know or understanding who is or even who he was . the book follows the growing appreciation and understandings that quang eventually gains for his dad . as he learns more about his father 's past and sees his personal courage and sense of duty and what drove him to become the man he was . when the author himself wears the uniform of marine aviator and fights in the gulf war , he begins to gain more insights on the sacrifices that his dad had made for his own country of south vietnam . we take this spiritual and emotional journey with the author as he gradually begins to sense what factors and motives drove his father on his own personal journey . the book also details and addresses some old history from that time period and that war . most americans have either forgotten or never knew about our national attitudes and polices with regard to the war and lack of regard for our allies the south vietnamese . it may make for some interesting but uncomfortable reading . it is a well-written and poignant story that embraces two very different wars . his story unites two different generations into an emotional bridge between father and son . it is touching and deeply moving . the author does a great job of making the reader feel a part of the experience . this book receives the military writer 's society of america 's highest book rating of five stars ! this book also receives my personal endorsement
in school my class and i read the book the wish giver . this book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small , chubby , mysterious little man named thaddeus blinn . when each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way . the moral of the story is `` be careful what you wish for '' . this was a very interesting book . i really enjoyed it . bill brittain was a wonderful author . i highly reccomend this book .
this film shows a <NUM> speakeasy . elmer gantry is feeling no pain , and walks around to collect money on christmas eve for the salvation army . his sleaziness and dishonesty are quite apparent . after hopping a freight train , he jumps off to avoid being robbed . he seems to live without working , just going from town to town . [ a crooked gambler or a confidence man ? ] next he shows up at a revival meeting , where a young woman preaches and passes buckets for donations . [ is this entertainment before radio and movies ? ] elmer 's attempt to meet sister sharon falconer is rebuffed ; she knows the type . can a salesman switch to a new line of products ? [ many say it 's the personality not the product . ] elmer 's speech is quite popular with the audience . but what makes him give up smoking and drinking ? or inspire his speeches ? there is another scene where a member of the audience begins to bark ! revivals grew out of the rural frontier , where people gathered like at a social event . a revival in zenith can bring in church members , converts , donations , and publicity . but the revival company needs a guarantee to cover their fixed costs . [ no one thinks of cutting costs . ] george babbitt explains why they must fill the churches - so people wo n't be tempted by other diversions ( like politics ) . sister sharon 's speech moves the crowd . it 's a successful social event . the film shows how the press can turn public opinion against the revival meeting . [ no mention of their hidden agenda . ] there is an interesting philosophical conversation in the editor 's office . elmer shows his dialectical skills ; he learned rhetoric at his seminary school . god 's will brought sister sharon to zenith , she will be able to build her tabernacle . there is a large amount of populism in his speech ; he attacked powerful corporations . [ rural farmers were hit by the depression in <NUM> . ] elmer 's call for popular revolt seems quite radical . he leads an attack on a speakeasy , then a brothel . local gambling dens are overlooked . elmer 's past catches up with him : a blonde in a hotel room . this is a trap to photograph him in the act , a trick often used against reformers . they ask for a huge amount in blackmail , and for sharon to deliver the cash . the publication of the photos are a front page scandal . attendance drops off . some rowdies show up to create a disturbance . [ did shutting down local vice hurt the wallets of the local ruling class ? ] a man who went deaf suddenly appears . after sister sharon lays her hands on him and calls for his healing . it works ! [ no ringer here . ] but a discarded cigarette causes a fire and a panic . is this the work of a devil ? no fire regulations ? sister sharon leaves for a better world . [ i do n't know if this film is true to the book . it is a good story , but the ending seems weak . ] why did people in rural areas turn to revivalism ? <NUM> saw the beginning of the great depression for them . other organizations like the populists or the socialists were suppressed , their leaders jailed . religion was the only way they could assemble together without being stopped . that is why the corporations were against them .
wonderful harmony , great voices , beautiful music . this group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful
in america is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy . it is also about hope . the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way . they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs . the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks . besides , a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child 's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life . i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons . if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see . if for nothing else than the performances of `` mateo '' and young `` kristie . '' just amazing .
i just finished the historical atlas and while the book does a great job of touching on so many subjects in such a small space , it leaves a little to be desired because it does not focus on any one point in the city 's development enough . i would have enjoyed the book more if it had a little more detail on how landmarks came to be where they are , and what the political an social culture of the city was at different time points that influenced the way the city developed . i suppose that was n't the book 's intent , though . also , it would be nice to get a follow up chapter on the city 's continued development since <NUM> . overall , i thought the book was a good intro to nyc history , but i think i 'm going to try a more in-depth history to fill in some gaps

despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing , this is a great release form the sisters . an album after being absent for <NUM> years ? ! what more can any clark fan expect . i 'm surprised to see contributions from karen and dorinda in terms of writing . since twinkie has been writing the music for <NUM> years , i figured that the case would be the same . what a nice surprise . karen and dorinda are both great song writers .
the 2nd installment of the adventures of superman is only as good as the 1st season . if you like the old days when life was much simpler , start collecting this entire series . great features , interviews , crisp , bright picture in glorious b & w

this is what country music lacks today , the passion of john anderson . all these mindless , & quot ; popcountry & quot ; songs are no match for any song by john anderson
i do n't know how familiar i can say i am with krzystof kieslowski . i 've seen 2/3 of `` the decalogue '' his ten-hour masterpiece and now i 've seen the first film in his three colors trilogy `` blue . '' i think anyone who sees a film by kieslowski will have a hard time disputing that he was one of the great directors . he 's not credited as being one of the great directors , but he is credited as being a great director . hopefully , in the years to come , his brilliance will become acknowledged . `` blue '' is a strange film ... it does n't follow the typical rules of storytelling . it has a plot , but the images it uses play as big a part in telling the story as the plot does . then there 's the music . rarely has the music been as important to a film as it is to `` blue . '' juliette binoche ( who won a french oscar for best actress for this role ) plays julie , a young woman whose husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident . julie was in the car , but made it out alive . once she heals up , she finds herself being badgered by friends and composers for her husband 's last composition ( her husband was a famous composer ) . the movie 's turning point comes when julie calls an old friend that she knows is in love with her . after they do their thing , she moves into an anonymous little apartment building in the hopes of escaping everyone she knows . she fears being hurt again and decides to have no friends , no acquaintances , and no family . then , in a kieslowski-like turn of events , she meets her husband 's pregnant mistress . there are a lot of movies about people losing loved ones and trying to deal with it . in kieslowski 's hands , however , this formula seems fresh and new . there 's no denying that kieslowski and his co-writer krzystof piesiewicz understood the human condition and humans in general . none of the scenes in the film feel artificial or unneeded . kieslowski does n't waste time filling the screen with pointless scenes , but has it shaved down to the essentials . as i said , this film is very different . unique would sum it up quite good . while i 'd be lying if i said i understood the significance of this , there is something he does in the movie that i was quite fond of . in certain scenes , while julie is talking usually , loud music will begin playing and the screen will fade to black . after a few moments , we fade back into exactly where we were . while i have n't seen the other films in the trilogy quite yet , i 'm looking forward to them . any fan of foreign cinema should see this film ... if you have n't yet discovered kieslowski , you need to . grade : a
my watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world . the premise of the film was disturbing to say the least . i have never been a true fan of charleton heston who in my opinion always has overacted . however , edward g. robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played . his performance was truly heartfelt , bringing to mind the current debate on `` ending one 's own life with dignity '' . i shutter to think that this is life as it should be though . but robinson 's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him . i found the other actors to be somewhat bland . perhaps this was acting at that point in time , but some actors can make the most of roles and others can not . the story line was unique , but the script was lacking . a re-make today by steven spielberg might be worthwhile seeing . perhaps the most striking element i took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up
based on the rejection of the & quot ; hypodermic & quot ; theory of advertising , the idea that we are not hapless victims is something most students of media will here about . propaganda is not as powerful as we believe , but our own desire to buy is very powerful . his views on the negativity of our consumerism are what make him and his work so different
reader beware - <NUM> plus pages , so this is no book for story time . extremely prolific , james a. michener writes as only he can write about the caribbean , that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by cuba , puerto rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape . this is a powerful history of these islands , and james michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to castro 's cuba . this is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from , as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel . you will learn more from this book about the caribbean sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you , and you will have more fun doing it ! i gave it four stars simply because with a book this size , there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts , and there were . if it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a pulitzer
to finally be able to see this terrific doris day variety show in all it 's restored color and fantastic sound was something to behold ! day looks and sings like a dream and it 's just ashame that she did not do more of these types of shows at this point in her career . the highlights for me were to be able to view the show without the laugh track .... you could really enjoy the music .... and of course .... day 's <NUM> 's redition of her big hit sentimental journey .... do n't think she has ever sung better
bon jovi is a band that may not be the best one ( the best one 's were led zeppelin , rolling stones or pink floyd ) , but their record-sales say otherwise . there is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated , as well as that they went big on jon bon jovi 's coiffeur and outlook , though . nonetheless , i think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the <NUM> 's offering people catchy , competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the mtv . all in all , that 's how metal sounded in the mid-80 's ( just take whitesnake or def leppard ) . personally , i have always been an advocate of this band , turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it . yes , bon jovi has made couple of cheesy songs ( `` always '' ) and some both cheesy and too commercial as well ( `` it 's my life '' ) . `` it 's my life '' was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts , but , if there are any open-minded music passionates there , you will notice that other bands had it as well ( van halen had `` jump '' , kiss had `` i was made for loving you '' ) . one has to take the band as a whole , and simply ca n't deny the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like `` new jersey '' or `` keep the faith '' . so , if you are too narrow-minded to rate this , you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower . before `` ktf '' was released bon jovi came into the studio very motivated and full of energy after a well-deserved 4-year- break that immediately followed the incredible `` new jersey '' tour . they had sold out stadiums , giving over <NUM> concerts all around the world and the tour itself consolidated their position on the music market and confirmed how well they do on-stage . but unfortunately it also put on the brink their common career as a band . `` five different guys took five different planes to five different places . there were no goodbyes '' - jbj once used to say . no wonder `` keep the faith '' was the ultimate , long-awiated album in the <NUM> 's and this waiting had <NUM> major purposes : <NUM> ) to finally write off the larger-than-life <NUM> 's survivor as a mere , temporary , fashion-yielding hair-band <NUM> ) or to prove people that jon & richie were in fact much more than `` living on a prayer '' and were capable of adopting to the changable <NUM> 's music scene ( with grunge at the forefront ) . for the first group of critics , like the above-underwritten amazon reviewer andrew mueller being sic and tired of bon jovi 's recent expansion , the very album - no matter how good it might turn out to be - was a blessing so much awaited to prey on , that he boldly , blatantly and with a smirk on his face dismissed even such masterpieces like `` dry county '' ; and that doing this with a mere wave of a hand , claiming it 's `` pointless '' or `` longish '' . pathetic indeed , but it shows how much stirr there was once the album has been released . fortunately , the cd speaks for itself and proves again that if bj 's star was ever to be thwarted for good - then it should have been done much earlier , namely right after their second `` <NUM> fahrenheit '' . ironically enough , their debut album was received very well on both sides of the ocean , and most of the critics that hated `` slippery when wet '' ( see acclaimed british music magazine `` kerrang '' ) showed much warmth and sympathy towards it . as far as the second group of people - they once again got a longplay that fully satisfied their crave for tuneful , melodic rock ; yet not an ordinary hair-metal this time . jon knew it well and it was n't only for his change of haircut . the singalong choruses remained the same , the peculiar bj-flow that makes people tapping their fingers as well ; yet the album is much more than that , being a lot more mature in terms of lyrics , diversity and overall coherence . if the title song was to become the new `` living on a prayer '' and `` bed of roses '' a new `` i 'll be there for you '' , then ok - it would indicate that a new era for the band has just begun . but if someone ever bought `` slippery when wet '' just for <NUM> songs dismissing the rest , then he/she is not going to do this this time , with this album , i 'm telling you . the epic `` dry county '' was reviewed and summarized many times so far , but i do n't know if it abides any summary in fact ; since this is one of the songs you must hear and relish in it every single time , peruse every single tune , from the very beginning , climaxing with richie 's solo , and fading away with dave 's keyboards . i was on a concert in germany a month ago ( `` have a nice day '' tour ) and you ca n't imagine what a surprise it was for me when they played this one at the very end of the show ! whooah , this is one of the moments i will remeber until the end of my life . with tears in your eyes , you live for such moments . `` dry county '' is also undoubtedly the most accomplished , advanced and ambitious band 's effort , looking at the entire 20-some-years-career . it is a class for itself , compare this epic to `` stairway to heaven '' , `` shine on you crazy diamond '' or gunsnroses ' `` november rain '' . i wont't exaggerate at all if i say this album is worth having just for this single track , since it is one of the most important songs that have ever been recorded . let people like andrew mueller - with full respect towards his work and criticism - long live they in their blissful oblivion dismissing `` dry county '' as `` pointless '' . but `` keep the faith '' is a lot more than `` dry county '' , i tell you . `` if i was your mother '' , which is my second favourite track here , is a huge bow towards grunge music ; `` fear '' as well . it clearly shows that guys took into account changing fashions and wrote these two almost-heavy-metal tracks . the `` mother 's '' riff is incredible , merging pearl jam , nirvana and guns n roses . `` in these arms '' and `` i 'll sleep when i 'm dead '' are happy-rockers that can be hummed any time on a party , somewhat reminescent of the recent albums , like `` <NUM> in the shade '' or something ! `` little bit of soul '' and `` blame it on the love of rock n roll '' are two very good tracks - yet again in another mood - that close this marvelous album and , merging soul and blues , make a final statement about the incredible diversity `` keep the faith '' offers . of course `` bed of roses '' was a huge hit and is arguably their best ballad ever , whereas the title track - being the first single at the same time - made it into the us top20 , is very heavy with incredible sambora 's guitar-solo , and it also smacks somewhat of grunge . overall , this is an incredibly miscellanous and diverse record that you wo n't get bored of ... never ! the only reason why i 'm not giving full <NUM> stars ( but 4,5 ) is because i 've got acquainted with the take-off material from those sessions , and it stirrs the entity for me , i do n't know why but somehow it does . it gets my goat that the band not always makes the right choice when it eventually goes to make the final song-selection . tracks that appeared recently on the jubille `` 100,000,000 million fans ca n't be wrong '' , like `` the fire inside '' , `` sympathy '' or `` temptation '' really should have made this great album . had these great songs been included istead of cheesy ballad `` i want you '' or mediocre `` woman in love '' , it could have been one of the greatest and most diverse albums in music history . probably other bon jovi-fans agree with me . anyway , this is an incredible album , almost as good as `` new jersey '' . only `` nj '' did n't have <NUM> less strong songs , it was almost perfect ... well just kidding , ok it had terrible `` bad medicine '' ; - ) ) this is a must-have .
i have n't read anything by flannery o'connor since `` all things that rise must converge . '' i fell in love with her stories . there is so much life in them . i read this work to get an idea about her `` sitz im leben '' , her life-situation , her milieu . a lot of it is correspondence , and there are some presentations as well . i am wondering if it speaks to the modern would-be novelist as much as it spoke to writers of her time and place . she says that one needs to write out of the context of where you are : the place , the people , the geography . this is mandatory , not optional . this book is for writers . i appreciate her writing about how to be catholic in the south , a very small minority . she has contributed much to finding faith in the stories of life , even violent and brutal stories . i look forward to my next work of hers
i had n't heard anything about this movie when i bought it , but the cover caught my eye . i ended up with one of my favorite movies ever . this film is very much a coming of age film about a young boy going through rough times and dealing with the guilt of a tragic mistake . this film pulls at the heartstrings and appeals to the eyes . for lovers of art house films , this is a must have . often times hazy , often times gritty , and always beautiful , this film will not disappoint .
i remember reading this work years ago in connection with the study i was then making of american jewish literature . my impression was much that of another amazon reader . it is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience , but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling . it may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with henry roth 's `` call it sleep '' which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness . this work is a more externally directed narrative , and has its virtue in giving a picture of one person 's move to the new world
i am a former cheerleader and cheerleading coach and really enjoy this dvd . i bought it for my young daughter and loaned it out to some of my cheerleaders when coaching . it teaches the basics : the motions and what they 're called , some cheers and chants , and one really fun dance routine . it also goes a little bit into what it means to be a cheerleader for your school and what will be expected of you and the code of conduct that you 'll be expected to follow . it does not go into jumps or stunting at all . the stunting is definitely something cheerleaders do n't want to learn from a dvd , but i was disappointed that they did n't teach any jumps . another reviewer somewhere else , a former cheerleader , gave this dvd low marks because she expected to get a good workout from it and relive the good-old-days . let me just point out to everyone , this is an instructional dvd for beginners . it 's not a workout dvd and it 's not for cheerleaders that already have a lot of cheer experience . also , the organization that put this dvd together is the uca , one of the biggest cheer-instruction organizations out there . they 've been conducting cheer clinics all over the country for many years . other cheer organizations do some motions differently or have different names for them . there is no right or wrong way , but aspiring cheerleaders should know this in case they make it on a squad coached by someone trained by one of the other groups . always follow your coach 's instructions and do n't challenge him or her with these differences . one more word of advice for aspiring cheerleaders : unless you live in a very rural , small town with a small student population and are sure there wo n't be much competition at try-outs , take gymnastic classes . cheerleading has become very athletic and competitive . to increase your chances in the more populated areas , you will need tumbling skills . dance classes - especially hip-hop - would n't hurt either . yoga - to increase balance and flexability - would help a lot , too . good luck
the crumbling wall against tyranny is the most interesting book that i 've ever seen on the american revolution , our sytem of government , and the current state of affairs . the book is authorative , yet humorous at times . complicated legal concepts are explained in terms that i , a mere high school/trade school grad , can easily understand . i was particularly impressed with the authors ability to relate experiences of growing up in a small town to our national government ( chapters <NUM> & <NUM> ) . i , too , grew up in such a small town , albeit my small town was <NUM> miles away and considerably colder , yet it seemed the same as my little town . in summary , i was very impressed with `` the crumbling wall against tyranny '' and i would recommend it to any one interested in american government especialy the parents of students who are studying or will be studying the constituion .
this novel was difficult for me to get into . the noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry . after training myself to think in terms of the language , i found myself so engrossed in the story that i moved through it at a steady pace . definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding
this is the best book on boxing i 've encountered . the author does a good job of explaining technique and providing drills for exercise . however , any book on boxing will be inadequate for learning how to box . good boxing skills ca n't be learned from a book - just the way you ca n't learn to dance well from a book . to physically know how to box you need a trainer and you need to get in the ring and spar . to master the techniques , it must feel right . you acquire that feeling by watching your trainer and having him/her correct your mistakes . you have to be physically next to that person ( anyone who 's learned to box or dance will tell you this is true ) . you polish those techniques and gain confidence in using them through sparing . yet the author does deserve credit for putting out a fine book
this is a great movie that just gets better with the years . released in <NUM> it had to compete with `` gone with the wind '' and `` the wizard of oz '' , so it ran a little under the radar . when it comes to the revolutionary war <NUM> % of people think gen. washington at valley forge , brandywine and the climatic battle at yorktown va. maybe more interesting and just as important was the war that was fought on the american frontier . that is the subject of this movie and it is done well . a boyish henry fonda plays gil martin and claudette colbert ( who received top billing over fonda ) stars as his wife , lana . clothing and props are authentic as well as the flintlock rifles that are used . john carridine does a great job as `` caldwell '' , the loyalist leader of the indian forces that attack the `` whig '' settlers . best of all it has been digitally remastered and looks better than ever . a special features section explains how this was done . it is good to finally see this movie on dvd and it should be in the library of everyone who enjoys historically based movies
when i first read this book i became fascinate with the story , the characters seems to be very representative of the so call & quot ; lesbian nation & quot ; about the sisters and queers . also establish the transformation suffer by the lesbian & quot ; type & quot ; between the decades of <NUM> , 1970,1980 and <NUM>
... when i discovered it in hawaii . whenever i listen to it , i remember the peace i found there , and i used several of the songs at my wedding . in fact , the main song `` shores of avalon '' became the basis of the theme to my wedding last year . i also used one of the songs `` full moonlight dance '' to create a dance ensemble piece with persian , middle eastern and ballet influences , which was performed at a concert in burbank , ca in <NUM> . i tried to write to tina malia to tell her how much i love the album , and also think the musicianship is fantastic , but could n't get a message through . perhaps she is a true gypsy . anyway , i come into contact with lots of different world music , and this album consistently rates as one of my top favorites
even though this set has <NUM> dvds , it 's really chopped up and feels incomplete . some of this i know is a result of technical difficulties ( such as the who still playing while the broadcast was disconnected ) , but there are songs i specifically remember , and looking forward to seeing . i was very disappointed to not have the complete concert , or complete sets from bands ( and no led zeppelin ! ? ! ? ! c'mon man ) . it 's still a landmark concert , the set from queen was amazing , and the proceeds go to a good cause , but that does n't mean that i 'm not disappointed . when will the complete dvd come out
this book seriously makes you think . not only is it suspenseful , it 's a teen angst novel , too . it shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far . the characters are belivable , and sometimes you hate them , and other times , you wish that they 're your best friend , especially mark , who later on in the book has a suprise secret that will leave you in a cold sweat
first off , i recommend that you buy this book if you are at all interested in knife fighting . this is one of the first and one of the classical american books on knife fighting . it covers all of the basic techniques that american forces have used for many , many years . at the same time , this book is a little short on techniques , and it is entirely absent the escrima techniques that have become very popular over the past couple of decades . if you do n't look at this book as everything for everybody , you will find it a very good buy and not be disappointed . on the other hand , if you 're looking for the snappiest way to open and close your balisong , you 're going to have to look elsewhere , as this book was written before that time
while most of the one year chemistry texts cover more or less the same principles , the order varies , the illustrations are similar , but they vary most in the way they explain the material . it is in the vocabulary they use and develop that helps the student develop the intuitions , understanding , and skills the authors are after . this is a very well written text that is useful for non-chemistry majors as well as science students needing an introductory course in chemistry . i am reading and working through this text with my <NUM> year old son . yes , he is bright and interested in science , but the text is clear enough for both of us to be able to grasp and understand the principles each section of each chapter is presenting to us . not only does this text focus on teaching the basic principles of chemistry , it also includes historical notes in the margins , and the text focuses on the practical uses of chemistry to illustrate its principles through practical applications . while other texts also have these features , i believe this text to be quite accessible to even those without a strong previous grounding in science . each chapter begins with a series of bullet points introducing what is going to be discussed along with a short essay . i like the marginal notes and illustrations as well as the `` give it some thought '' feature that asks the student a question or two in order to clarify understanding and ensure a grasp of the principles introduced in that section . like most modern textbooks , there is also a liberal use of color to aid in presentation and guide the eye . the authors also provide occasional `` strategies in chemistry '' boxes that encourage the student to develop a certain kind of thought process and ways in looking at the principles of chemistry . at the end of each chapter is a section called summary and key terms that hits the highlights of each section in a paragraph or two with the key terms in boldface . then there is a section called visualizing concepts that have basic problems with illustrations in order to get the student to work mentally on the material learned . the section of problems has a series of questions for each section with the red numbered questions having the answers in the back of the book . there are also a series of handy tables provided as appendices and standard charts on the inside of the front and back covers including the periodic table . again , many of these features are included in other texts because there has been quite a bit of convergence on what is to be taught in a one year introduction to chemistry course . the differences are in the way things are said more than what is covered . i think this is an excellent and very useful text for learning the basics of chemistry and why it matters in our world
this is the 3rd & culminating text of jung 's cw trilogy on alchemy ( see cw11 psychology & alchemy & cw12 alchemical studies before reading this one ) . jung obviously devoted considerable time & effort into the study of alchemy -- because he perceived an amazing parallel with his theories/model of the psyche & the process of individuation . i think it amazed him that the alchemists intuitively evoked such general principles of transcendental alchemy prior to the development of western science -- indeed , they were simultaneously immersed in this development such that modern chemistry evolved from it . oddly , some are now advocating the use of chemicals ( drugs ) in lieu of psychology -- e.g . for schizophrenia . maybe the tail is wagging the horse ? of course , this is a difficult text . the alchemical series may be the most difficult of jung 's already difficult texts . but , as jung demonstrated himself , sometimes the way to learn is to just jump in feet first -- absorb as you can . eventually , the material will start to sink in -- subconsciously if not consciously . give it a whirl . this text also has some very interesting quotes : p. <NUM> `` there is something serious in every joke . p. <NUM> if one does not understand a person , one tends to regard him as a fool . p. <NUM> it seems as if christianity had been from the outset the religion of chronic squabbles , and even now it does everything in its power never to let the squabbles rest . remarkably enough , it never stops preaching the gospel of neighborly love . p. <NUM> the creative mystic was ever a cross for the church , but it is to him that we own what is best in humanity ... 'where there is no vision , the people perish ... the mystics are channels through which a little knowledge of reality filters down into our human universe of ignorance and illusion : a totally unmystical world would be a world totally blind and insane ... the few theocentric saints who exist at any given moment are able in some slight measure to qualify and mitigate the poisons which society generates within itself by its political and economic activities . in the gospel phrase , theocentric saints are the salt which preserves the world from decay . ' ( quoting aldous huxley in grey eminence <NUM> , pp . <NUM> , * 296. p. <NUM> fantasies always mean something when they are spontaneous . p. <NUM> never do human beings speculate more , or have more opinions , than about things which they do not understand . p. <NUM> nothing changes anything else without itself being changed . '' how profound can you get
* disclaimer : i am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what i am addressing . * i do not mean to say that bennett and hacker have all the answers , but their `` ordinary language '' approach , along with their debt to wittgenstein , ryle , kenny and strawson , says something about their book . most contemporary philosophers of mind ( sprague , strawson and hacker , among others , excluded ) have rightly dismissed the soul , but have decided that there is something `` mysterious '' about consciousness , or perception or emotion , or what have you . in response , bennett and hacker have shown what `` consciousness '' really is : the conscious acts of people existing in the world . this is why we know that other people are conscious actors : they do conscious things such as watch birds , or play chess , or eat ham sandwiches . if michael tye 's or david chalmers ' or colin mcginn 's problems of consiousness ( e.g . that i can know that you feel the same pain that i feel , or that you see the same color that i see ) are indeed problems for you , you should read this book ; if it does n't prove to you that they are not problems at all , at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions
this cd is just okay . the early jb ballads are the thing here . gives you a good idea of a good chitlin ' circuit performance as typically done for black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response . the standouts here include the extended version of & quot ; lost someone & quot ; which leads into & quot ; please please please. & quot ; even without being able to see the infamous cape routine , it 's quite entertaining . but overall , vol . <NUM> is better since that cd plays up the more uptempo stuff that put jb on the map
what can one say about this book that has n't been said before ? `` speaker for the dead '' is fundamentally different from `` ender 's game . '' those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology , which is a welcome change of pace . `` speaker for the dead '' is by turns gripping , moving , frustrating , interesting , preachy and grossly manipulative . it 's not perfect , but what is ? wise readers will stop the ender series at the end of `` speaker for the dead '' and pretend that `` xenocide '' does n't exist . do n't say i did n't warn you
after watching `` tupac resurrection , '' i found myself with a much greater appreciation for 2pac 's music . i was also amazed how 2pac 's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if tupac himself was narrating his own documentary . although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life ( and death ) , it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2pac 's narration . tupac lived an amazing life , even if it was tragically cut short . tupac resurrection , then , is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of tupac or rap in general . i watched this movie with my brother , who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all , and even he enjoyed the movie . it is just that 2pac was such a charismatic , intelligent , and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to . and , this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life , from birth to death . if you are a fan of 2pac , this is a must-have . as i said before , after watching `` tupac resurrection '' i gained an even greater appreiciation of his music . even for those that are n't fans of tupac or even rap in general , i highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing , becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium , and then dies a tragic , early death . the only thing i have left to do is quote roger ebert 's review , because i really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says , `` let 's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music , but might have it in you to see one . this is the one . '' i highly recommend this movie to everyone . rap fans or not . tupac fans or not
i was laughing hysterically when i read dicks review of john lennon , i looked at the other things he reviewed - aprox . <NUM> albums , and he was bitching about them all , gave them all one star , so the only albums he reviewed were the ones he disliked .... oh yeah except for the beegee 's , he likes them . lol so forget peace and love and understanding- its all jive talking .
if some one had told me this film would turn into a story of an actual war between nations , i would have watched it sooner . the reviews i had read for it made it sound like a rip-off of akira , and the first hour or so makes you think it just might be it . a group of friends who are in a sort of xtreme motorcycle sport find themselves in the middle of their nation aphrodia invaded by the nation of their enemy ishtar . they quickly find themselves under military rule , and have to deal with life changing in such a time period . the group eventually decides to do some guerilla action and attack an enemy tank that is always in their stadium . then , just as the tank is destroyed and reinforcements are coming up , and the hero is about to be run over ... a free io soldier fires a missile into the octo and destroys it . then the movie becomes a story of a nation fighting for their freedom , as the group joins the free soldiers who are fighting ishtar all the way back out of io . eventually the hero , at first sympathetic , is convinced to join forces . the final battle takes place in the capital of io , and what a climax it is . overall , the film boasts fine animation and retro <NUM> 's anime design . the action is well done and the mecha designs even better , and the storyline is also exceptionally well done . you get a good sense of a population under foreign rule , and its good to see an anime exploring such depths . also , the politics of a nation in exile fighting for their return is equally unique . maybe its because i 'm a political nut , but i found it all interesting . if i had known i would have enjoyed this film , i would have watched it far sooner than i did . oh well ... i bought the dvd the minute i saw it . i 'm proud to own it . and thats my word
i own every danzig-era misfits release and to me this is hands down the best one of them all . a solid album with <NUM> awesome tracks plus a bonus track of studio screw ups . every song on here is a great listen plus the sound quality isnt that bad compared to his other recordings . there are alot of reviews claiming walk among us is there defining masterpiece but i disagree ; its great but not as great as static age
nature 's way . two of the most powerful words in the english language . and yet we believe it is completely unnatural to relinquish our `` three-squares-a-day '' mentality . after all , what could be more natural than eating ? problem is ... we are digging our graves ... with our teeth . if nature 's way is powerful , then transformation is even more powerful . if you are ill , if your cholesterol is high , if you are atherosclerotic or hypertensive , if you have diabetes , if you have an autoimmune disorder , could there be a chance that you 've developed the foregoing condition ( s ) one bite at a time ? could there be a chance that you 've eaten your way to disease ? if so , dr. fuhrman 's claims of recapturing and restoring ones health are valid . this is n't quack medicine . to wit , he cites hundreds of scientific studies which he , himself , collated in his `` chapter notes . '' i must admit i was skeptical upon reading this book . after all , how can we improve our health by cutting off our own fuel supply i reasoned ? upon initiating a gentle refeeding program at the end of a seven-day fast , i found that i had more energy than ever before . i also made a self-discovery during the fast : i had a sinister food addiction . sinister , because this addiction was unbeknownst to me until i started to fast . i discovered that throughout my adult life , i had simply been eating when i did not need to eat . life-threatening diseases do not always shout at us with warning signs . they rather whisper . toxins in the body do not always announce their presence . i have always questioned the misnomer of `` sudden death . '' is a death really sudden if it represents the culmination of self abuse and a behaviorally-driven , ongoing toxic lifestyle ? do n't we give greater precedence to cleaning our cars , than we do to cleaning the machinations of our own bodies ? do we honestly believe that a protein-rich , sugar-saturated , fat-based diet is helping us ? look around you . obesity is ubiquitous . perhaps you , yourself , are overweight or obese , or wallowing in a seemingly endless downward spiral of disease and debilitation . there is hope . you can indeed , as dr. fuhrman claims , recoup good health . not only can you function with a few relatively simple modifications , you can also flourish . conversely , you can , as they say , `` continue to do what you 've always done , and you will deserve to get what you 've always got . '' for the price of six big macs , you can do a `` <NUM> '' by simply investing in this book . this book will change your life ... forever . sorry i am indeed to only award it five stars when it deserves a galaxy
this band is pretty good i think it had potenial to become better & quot ; bonethrower & quot ; is prob the best song on here but i could be wrong all of the songs are worthy and could be hits its alot better than limp bizkit and puddle of mudd which come from the same record company as these guys ..... but i put this band in the standards of soundgarden which is saying alot if you like soundgarde
from track one to thirteen i found they we where all great . i picked up on a lot of new york influences in the writing of the lyrics . man this cd is great i got it last wednesday took a drive and have n't stopped listening to it , and now i ca n't wait to see him next tuesday , rather them . if you are a bright eyes fan , or have just started listening to them , or have n't heard them at all this will either a : want you to get more of his stuff or b : just listen to the cd over and over it is that good . he really brought it together with just great writing , great formations of the songs , and just overall chills when i listen to it . i know all of his albums are personal , but this one is just great .
one of my favorite books . i read this again a couple of months ago . florentino ariza 's <NUM> year unrequited love for the haughty fermina daza is an amazing allegory of human love . when fermina marries another man , florentino does n't ever give up . doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together . in a way he is a ridiculous don quixote , undaunted by reality , pining over a lost cause . somehow this bizarre little man hopes on . no , he does n't hope . he insists . he becomes president of the local shipping company , he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind , his love of the arts mirrors his love for her . why does this work ? marquez is just a genius . he simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words . and so they come to life
this is a solid rock album . but it 's not as good as their previous effort & quot ; spiritual machines & quot ; . the sound has more bottom to it ( thanks to bob rock -- or no thanks ? ) but at the same time it is n't heavier , which is strange . at first i was very disappointed with the album ( i have all their previous recordings ) , but it eventually grew on me . however , if this is a new direction for the band , i do n't know if i like where it 's going
if you loathe exercise videos in which the instructor is telling you `` good job - keep it up - way to go - that looks good '' when you know they ca n't see you , this is an excellent alternative . cindy is clear in her instructions , of course her body is inspirational , and she does n't insult your intelligence . the video itself is shot in some beautiful locations and the music is n't overbearing . the actual exercise sequences are challenging and continue to be so - even if you use this tape several times a week for a few months like i did . the best thing about this video is the results - i used this video several years ago and got down to a healthy size 4/6 . i just ordered the dvd version to get me back into shape after having my first baby and ca n't wait to start this routine again !
this is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which is a shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting the jackpot with the `` spider-man '' franchise , has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving <NUM> movie . i was in a town on the southernmost tip of chile when i first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have hbo . not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the tv set back then . co-written by billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother 's psychic gifts the story is based ) and tom epperson , the plot revolves around the disappearance of jessica starlet , the daughter of a wealthy resident of a georgia backwater town . tired of blind alleys , the police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , a single mother of three sons , who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds a suspect in donnie barksdale , the abusive , white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters for annie is her attraction to wayne collins , her eldest son 's teacher and jessica 's fiancee ; and buddy cole , another of annie 's customers , a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child . while it 's not perfectly constructed , the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters ' voices and motivations throughout . raimi 's expert direction is full of sumptuous southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story . credit needs to be given to jamie anderson 's cinematography and neil spisak 's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot . some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns , including katie holmes as the spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear as the seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; and giovanni ribisi as the deeply troubled buddy . in the smallish role of valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count as she cringes from donnie 's scarifying dominance over her . but it 's the wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as annie . with a convincing southern accent , she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband , protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us . the dvd is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews , the movie 's trailer and a video of neko case 's `` furniture room lullaby '' which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric , character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer
i could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about . or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film , and find out that way . most of you probably know it by now , as it is . a few good men is on my ( and my wife 's ) list of top ten movies of all time .... with plenty of good reasons . as it has been said in many other reviews , the acting in this film ( from all the supporting actors as well ) is excellent . the story is good too .... very interesting , actually . it would be easy to look at this movie as simply a `` blockbuster '' kind of movie .... which , essentially , it is . it 's got a-list talent in front of , and behind the camera .... it made a hell of alot of money at the box office , so yes it 's a `` blockbuster '' . but it 's also a damn good story , as mentioned before . another thing i liked about this movie , was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between tom cruise and demi moore 's characters .... something most other films on this scale would have done . and i know it 's been said in many other reviews , but i 'm going to say it again anyway .... jack nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie . no , not because of that famous `` you ca n't handle the truth .... '' line . but because his acting really is that good . it seems so natural . his mannerisms are so natural , that he could pass for a real life military leader .... i am in the military myself , so i can vouch for this . and even though this movie is over two hours , i was never once bored .... you wo n't be either
i had never heard of the borowitz report until a couple of days ago , when a girl in my dorm showed me this book . i opened it up to a random page and saw the headline `` bush may lack gene for human speech . '' i started giggling as i read the piece and by the end of it i was laughing hysterically . this happened again and again as i flipped through the book until i realized i was laughing out loud on every page . no book has ever made me done that before . ( as for my tv viewing habits , i am a huge fan of the daily show and this book is right up there with it . ) the book is based on a daily e-newsletter called the borowitz report which i have now signed up to receive every day . if the guy can manage to write columns each day that are as funny as the ones in this book , i do n't know how he does it . this book is at the very top of my list of recommendations . you wo n't be sorry you got it
if you are a true alanis fan , the first rule is you must own everything she has done . second is you must love everything she has done ! this is a must for any collection to enjoy for years to come
this is a great album . it is perfect for doing chores at home , driving in the car or plugging away in the cubicle . i took a chance on this ablum because i enjoyed `` pins '' and `` maps '' from fever to tell and i am glad i did . `` golden lion '' , `` way out '' and `` cheated hearts '' are my favorites .
i bought this for my dad , ( a willie fan ) but having a chance to listen myself found it to be a charming , innovative amalgamation of simple , sincere , sometime sinister , musical thought based on a recurring theme . a `` stand alone '' accomplishment from an american icon
i love this workout cd . it is simple & i get a really good workout from it . i like that they have three <NUM> minute segments & you can do them all or one . the butt segment is my favorite section
most people somtimes wonder why this is more expensive then <NUM> 's hammer horror series since this has got <NUM> movies and the series has got <NUM> but that 's because in my opioin the hammer series was cheaply made if you are starting out go for this includes hammers first frankenstein and dracula movies plus the original mummy plus <NUM> dracula sequel 's and a frankenstein sequel the hammer horror series skips and freezes this is a boxset of seperate movies on separate disc 's thank god universal did n't get this ide
this book has opened my eyes and gave me a completly different view about myself , beliefs and authority that i have over myself . it 's one of those books that states things that we all know about ; it just makes you aware of them and teaches you how to use it in order to become successful in your life . you must read this book !
texas is home to many different musical styles , and adolph hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings . what strikes me is that while many would label his music as & quot ; diverse , & quot ; hofner would probably have just called it & quot ; music. & quot ; the fact that hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me , for i believe he is one of the great texas recording artists of all time , which puts him in grand company
i was quite surprised to see a biography of james tiptree , jr. at all , let alone such a magnificent one . ms. phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus . i ca n't imagine that any details of tiptree/sheldon 's life are not captured here . certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women 's role in our society . this bio will win several awards , no doubt about it . quite simply all you could ask for in one volume
wintry , restful , appropriate , delightful illustrations accompany one of my favorite robert frost poems . my children will enjoy this poem as much as i do
think a christmas carrol with a modern-day twist to it and you 've got family man . a tale of a man who chose buisness over pleasure . when told that he would get a higher-paying job out in the big city , he agreed to fly over there and take it . . . leaving his girlfriend behind who wanted to marry him really badly . he promised that he would come back and everything but never did . now , a few years later , he is the rich and fancy buisness man that he always wanted to be . but , one night he is confronted by a man who claims that he can give him a glmipse of what his future might have been . now it 's come true . and now he 's trying to get his buisness future back
just having discovered karen rose , i loved do n't tell , but was disapointed with have you seen her . i thought i 'm watching you was way better and i am glad i was not disappointed a second time . i 'm watching you combined all the essentials : suspense , great plot , developed , likeable characters with a past , and non-stop plot twists and turns . the romantic piece of the story was written in well , and was not overpowering as in have you seen her . i ca n't wait for rose 's next novel
tofcm was a awsome book . i enjoyed all of the authers different stories that were still under one over all subject . at times this book bored me in to a sleeping stuper but lucky most of the it scared me back into awakenes . at times in could not put down the book . then when that story was over and a new one came i got loney for the old story . over all some of the authers can wright and some of them ca n't .
i 've attempted to give five stars to 'shamrock diaries ' so i ca n't really give the same to 'on the beach ' despite it being stylistically similar to its predecessor , and nearly as good . really , a very , very good album with only a few clunkers . great melodies , great atmosphere
i knew the cultures were different , just never knew they were this different . i am anxious to read another book . not because i love it , but because i am amazed at who can survive it
this piece is haunting and beautiful . the collaberation of the chieftains and multiple female artists from around the world is so pleasing and mesmerising , i felt transported to another place and time .
this cd is by far my most favorite kenny chesney cd of all time ! i love each and every song on it . even the bonus tracks are fantastic ! a must have for the country music fan ! ! ! !
obviously mr. t. hardin is suffering from some musical mental problems . he would apparently refer the knuckle-dragging , amateurish , talentless stylings of the hundreds of bands that play the same three notes a thousand beats per minute while some oaf screams and growls unintelligible garble supposedly using all sorts of elaborate words for 'kill ' that neither the band nor the fans know how to use or say properly . ok , now that i 've gotten that rant over with , let me continue on to what you really want to read . this was actually the very first manowar album i heard . a friend picked it up the day it came out , let me borrow it after he listened to it once , and never got it back ( sorry darren ) . i was forever hooked . the first half of the album is classic , well produced , straight ahead metal . fantastic , clear solos on each song . the title track is a classic manowar anthem . it sums up what they are quite well . 'blow your speakers ' is not only another trademark metal anthem , but is also the closest manowar has gotten to an actual `` hit '' in the u.s. `` carry on '' , one of my instant favorites , is and inspirational rally cry ; the kind manowar is known for , among other things . `` violence and bloodshed ' is a fast and furious return to the heavy metal beginnings and vietnam theme that has n't been seen since the first album `` battle hymns '' . all in all the first half of this album is just in your face heavy metal . the second half is a return to the days of long , long ago . 'defender ' is one of the last things that the late , great orson welles ever did before his passing . i listened to this track at least <NUM> times in the first week i had this album . it aptly sets the tone for the rest of the record . a rich narrative that opens to a powerful crash of truly heavy metal . from this point on , this album does it all . beautifully clear and powerful bass lines . articulate and soaring lead solos . earth shaking drums . and the absolute best vocals on any recording of the time . 'drums of doom ' pounds you into 'holy war ' like a charging team of mammoth beasts which then throws you into the 'master of revenge ' , a mystical segue into 'black wind , fire and steel ' which blinds all with the relentless speed and accuracy of both music and lyrics . all done at a rate that almost defies logic . manowar have definitely cemented there place as the kings of metal with this album forevermore . all those who refuse to believe it can go back their amateurs and goons . leave us and make room for the true men of heavy metal .
writing out the storm is funny , smart , and inspirational -- like jessica herself . there 's no & quot ; authorial distance & quot ; here . she 's tapping us on the shoulder and saying , & quot ; try this. & quot
if you like gangster flicks , especially of the cockney 'firm ' variety , then you need to see this movie . sexy beast is a fantastic but underrated indie classic . like some of the other reviewers , i could watch this movie over and over again . gal dove ( ray winstone ) is a retired london mobster now living in spain , going to fat in idyllic bliss with his former porn actress wife dee dee ( amanda redman ) and their best friends , a married couple they 've known from when they were back in the life . into their domestic paradise enters don logan ( ben kingsley ) , another 'old friend , ' showing up unannounced , telling gal he has a job for him and `` no is not an answer . '' logan is one of those small wiry guys who make up for what they lack in height and muscle with an extra dose of psychotic meanness . crime boss teddy bass ( excellently played with menacing reticence by ian mcshane ) is planning an ambitious heist on a prestigious bank , logan is to help assemble the crew . logan wants gal in on the job and , as far as he 's concerned , he 's already made gal 's mind up for him . for logan it is only a matter of how little stroking he will need to do before he strikes . in one scene , it 's late and everyone is in bed , except logan who is in the bathroom shaving . standing in front of the mirror he starts thinking about gal 's refusal earlier in the evening . he begins muttering . needing to relieve himself , he continues thinking and muttering as he urinates all over the floor . by now , having worked himself up into a rage , he runs out the bathroom with shaving cream still on his face , down the hall and , screaming `` no ! no ! no ! '' storms into gal and dee dee 's bedroom kicking and punching the poor man out of his own bed . another scene in the movie shows logan sitting on a plane which will soon depart . thinking nothing of consideration for fellow passengers , or rules and regulations , he lights up a cigarette . when one of the passengers mildly protests , logan calmly but coldly informs the man that if he must put out the cigarette , he will be putting it out on him . when a flight attendant intervenes , logan gets up , grabs his bag and -- after telling all onboard he hopes the plane crashes and they all die -- demands to get off . after being removed and brought to airport security , logan explains to the security officer the incident was all a case of nerves . he concocts a tale about a male flight attendant groping him while boarding ! with a straight face , he tells the man that he felt violated and was literally in shock , not even realizing he was smoking a cigarette ! of course , he does n't wish to make a fuss about any of it and would just like to leave and forget the whole thing . he walks out the airport , right into a taxi and back to making gal 's life hell . i could n't stop laughing ! ben kingsley does for sexy beast what joe pesci did for goodfellas . both portray sociopaths , incapable of true consideration and comapassion . the way they selfishly crash through life is so disturbing it 's comes off comical . not giving too much of the story away , but gal does return to london to do the job . however , not for the reasons you might think . instead , something occurs which makes gal feel it necessary to get to london , complete the job and return to spain quickly as possible . ian mcshane is brilliant in this final segment of the film .
this is a great cd ... it doesnt quite show her true potential like `` stripped '' but its an excellent debut ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! britney move way outta the way . hahaha cant wait for christinas `` back to basics '' aug.15th ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
as good as it was when first published ... even more meaningful after <NUM> years . as valid now as it was then
this was always one of my favorite albums/tapes & i wanted the cd . it is in great condition . thanks so muc
_victory_ is the first conrad that i have read since reading _heart of darkness_ and _the secret sharer_ in high school . i was unsure what to expect before i picked up the book . in any case , i did n't expect it to be what it was -- so contemplative and so concerned with notions of isolation and the ability to act . despite the abstract themes , the book is neither slow nor unreadable . an adventure story wraps the whole thing up : a recluse on a deserted island breaks his solitude and rescues a girl from a life with a semi-shady gang . this act of kindness starts a chain of events that brings violence and change to his small world . the story moves along nicely , and you can read for the plot even if you are uninterested in the bigger issues the book raises . i found that i was interested in them . heyst ( the main character ) has been infected by his father 's skepticism and analytical viewpoint and never manages to find a way after that to engage with the world or other people in it . his few attempts at engagement are awkward and almost unwilling . everybody in the book is to some degree isolated . wang removes himself from chinese society to go native . mrs. schomberg is locked behind her mask of fear . mr. jones and ricardo are set apart because of the obsessive fear the gentleman has of women . alma/magdalena/lena is set apart by her past . everybody is trying to connect , but ( with the exception of lena ) always on their own terms and always within limits . it 's tempting to read conrad 's own background and separations into the mix , but i 'll leave that to the conrad scholars . worth reading
wow ! great quartets played with real gusto and dynamism by the prager string quartet . the sound is incredibly crisp and clear . the performances are impeccable . you wo n't be disappointed
this is dino at his best for christmas and throw in sammy & frank , what more could you ask for ? if you are a rat packer , this is a must have to complete your christmas music collection
this is an amazing , beautifully written first novel . not only is the plot first rate , the characters are drawn with a rare degree of perception and even compassion . the relationships are realistic and change as the investigation proceeds and when the murderer is caught . the dialogue is natural , and reflects the personality of the character speaking . there is also wonderful humor in the descriptions and the dialogue . this is the mystery to lend the friends who think mysteries are shallow , formulaic and generally not worth wasting time on . this is the book to lend to friends who love good writing . i ca n't wait for the next
if you wanted to write a game for a pocketpc device this would absolutly be your book . however , i 've been writing utility applications i find myself using this book over other references . this is the best lightweight wince/pocketpc progamming book out there- games or not . harbour covers topics in a very easy-to-understand way- from graphics and sound to networking . no matter what the issue i usually go to this book first , then then web , then one of the other wince books i own if need be . if you 're new to wince ( esp . coming from a non win32 background ) this book is exceptionally great
my favorite film of all time . i have the original dvd but bought this one purely for the bonus material , which , as far as i 'm concerned , is worth every penny . new interviews with all the main characters , including johnny depp . interesting commentary from lasse halstrom and peter hedges if you like to know the ins and outs ! ! ! money well spent
i really enjoyed this concert dvd . the sound is excellent . the performance is mesmerizing ; it was one hell of a show . occasionally , i was a little distracted by the post production editing which detracted from the show . that is my one complaint . i 'm not familiar with all the artists that assisted with the show , but i am assuming it was a huge a-list of hip hop stars . i would definitely see the gorillaz in concert after watching this dvd
this is just a delight . there is sadness , but it is handled beautifully and believably . the voices are so well suited to the animation . on the second disk do not miss `` sid on sid '' that is hilarious . there is plenty of ice age information for those who are interested , for the rest of us this is just fu
an x-ray of the venezuelan way of living . only after seeing this movie , which might seem like fiction but it is not , one can understand what it is to live in a latin american city like caracas : a city packed with drugs , violence and corruption - where regular citizens are on their own with no protection whatsoever . the sad part is that for us , venezuelans , watching this film feels `` too close to home '' . i know at least <NUM> people who have gone thru similar experiences
this is an excellent portrayal of the enron fiasco . it utilizes footage and sound bites , and interviews , it 's absolutely amazing what happened ! this film is a must see for everyone
i own every season of i love lucy .. this is another hit . great characters , funny storylines .. great punchlines .. i love i
one of the things this offers is real insight into the creative process . if you 're having writer 's block , i recommend these lectures for you . igor 's ideas may well help in clearing up some of the problems we create for ourselves
but i bought this one . could n't help it . the music was such a prominent part of the film , more so than any other film i 've seen . it was a good film , ok . i 'm not in love with it . but the music was in tune with the great parts of the film- never ever witnessed this before . witness : samuel jackson slipping on the gloves and coldly assasinating chris tucker . could that song , do n't even know what it 's called , be more shocking , fitting , pretty much every adjective . and then the end of the flick with jackie driving with a tear in her eye singing along- i do the same thing without the tear . truth told i did n't know much about this music before i saw the movie . but it makes me feel like i was there and that makes my life more exciting and that makes a good album . pulp fiction ost was really good too but to put it straight up , jackie brown is black soul that white boys do n't get the pleasure to hear . boo-yah !
but , why did columbia take so d # @ * long to give us the actual set order for philharmonic hall ? i found `` the complete concert '' to be unlistenable , knowing that some nitwit could n't be bothered with treating this music with the care and attention to detail that it deserves . flow is everything . oh , now they care , for $ <NUM> bucks . how nice ! and , for my money a box set really needs more rareties to be worth that hefty price tag . maybe berlin and tokyo are supposed to be the inducement to buy , but most real fans sprung for those long ago . am i wrong
zevon become famous with `` werewolves of london , '' a satirical critique of the world 's womanizers ( past and present ) , but as true zevon fans know , there was much more to this man than `` aaaaaoooo , werewolves of london '' and a three-chord progression that is as infectious as it is cutesy . the true warren zevon was a poet of sorts , a man who tackled difficult subjects ( `` excitable boy , '' for example , with a final verse that still gives me shivers ) , but still remained a sensitive man at heart ( `` accidentally like a martyr , '' for example ; do n't deny , it moves you ) . from the you-know-what hitting the fan in `` lawyers guns and money , '' to the purely delightful recitation of `` i need a truck , '' to the heart-wrenching `` tule 's blues , '' to the rockin ' romp of `` nighttime in the switching yard , '' to the world 's most famous undead thompson-gun toting anti-hero in `` roland the headless thompson gunner , '' excitable boy remains a rock 'n roll classic . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it 's a staple rock album . it is by far wittier and more creative than most rock albums ever produced ; sure , there are n't too many screaming electric guitars ( oh my god , is that guy playing a piano ? ? ? ) , but excitable boy is quite simply one of the best rock albums ever made . warren zevon was a folk/rock artist like none before him ... and , it 's safe to say , like none we will ever see again
my <NUM> & <NUM> year old love this movie . they love to dance to the music . garfield is so entertaining . this was a great buy .
i love this show.rated tv-pg for language , some drug use and sexual content.canada : pg.13 and up.certain episodes:9 and up
absolutely a positive influence for our young people ! ! ! i cherish her music , what a wonderful young woman with an amazing voice ... whatever she sings ! ! ! the next best voice of perfection
i enjoyed all the personal stories . it is a very inspirational book , all the exercises are fun and helpful . it is easy to read and really get into . this book is a great way to really get to know yourself
this is a must for that ole school flava his harmony brings pure pleasure for relaxation highly recommen
it is an amazing journey through our deepest fears and questions about life whether personal or professional . the first part goes through those questions all of us have or have had combined with real life examples and a second part where the author shares his insight as to what to do with all those questions and answers we start to get by reading the book
great childhood pictures of karen and her brother . this video is non-stop music combined with photos and videos from the past . especially for those who heard the carpenters on the radio day after day , this video is a real treat .
simply put , this was an outstanding book . if you are a guy then vince flynn 's books are for you . lots of action with just a touch of romance . you become very attached to the characters , epsically rapp and rieley . in the mitch rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that , very well written . i am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but i finished this book in two days , impossible to put down
i have good instincts , folks . just like all of you who 've already givin ' this a glowing review . i checked this out from the library a few days ago and was immediately floored . so much so that i 'm thinking about not reteurning it ; telling them i lost it an ' just paying for it . i 'm amazed at the gracefulness that comes across when you put together two so distinct an ' so different voices . louis ' scratchy , gruff , yet likeable an ' melodic croon an ' ella 's smooth-as-silk , soothing an ' intoxicating voice incredibly , to me , go perfectly on these duets here . from that first opener 'let 's call the whole thing off ' , done so sly an ' flirtatious on both parts , to 'gee , baby , ai n't i good to you ' to the ever-engaging 'autumn in new york ' and 'stars fell on alabama ' one of the greatest standards ever written ( `` and in the center just you and me , my heart beat like a hammer , my arms wound around you tight , and stars fell on alabama last night '' ) . that is what romance is , kiddies ! oh , an ' i ca n't forget 'summertime ' . ahhh , yes , 'summertime ' , with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love , happiness , sunlights an ' flowers ; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted . yeah , i know what you 're thinkin ' ; `` there he goes , layin ' it on thick again . '' well , i ca n't help it . in a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music i 've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years , it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who truly appreciate talent and genius . there 's no show-boating here , no bone-headed braggadocio , no studio gimmicks . this is what music is .
gives you so much insight into your own world . thank you for this book . it has helped me see the truth as it really is . not how i would want to see it
i love this movie ! ! i remember the first time i saw it , i was about 6-7 yrs.old , on a plane & on my way to puerto rico . eighteen ( or so ) years later , i bought it & watched it with my family , it brought back so many great memories , we loved it all over again . i love the music , the dancing & the actors/actresses , the only reason why i gave it <NUM> stars is because it is an <NUM> 's movie ! we all know how <NUM> 's dance movies have the bad fame of neing corny ! i have to admit , it did have some corny and bad acting moments , but all in all , i think this is an amewome movie , i love it & recommend it
please let me recommend this album from the bottom of my heart . i have heard it about a million times , but everytime i discover something new . tina 's voice is simply beautiful . a little bit of trivia ; tina dico 's real name is actually tina dickow , but her name was changed to make it more appealing to the english language . now you have something to tell your friends while listening to this superb album
a great book ! the author is big on automotive history , so you will know more about the industry and the people that formed it . walter chrysler just seems to be the man he tells the story around . i have found interest in other people from this time frame to read about too from this book
i do n't know how the guy does it . they keep getting funnier and there are always ones i 've never seen before , as well as the ones i 've always loved . you wo n't be disappointed if you are a far side fan . if you 're not a far side fan , well , then i ca n't help you
as the review below states , `` the tokyo blues '' is one of horace silver 's best albums . but with all due respect to mr. jones , let 's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the cd they are thinking about buying . recorded in july <NUM> , six months after a successful and impressionable tour of japan , `` the tokyo blues '' is silver 's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the pacific . each of the disc 's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of japanese culture or tradition . but do n't think silver went so far as to incorporate japanese music on this album , for this is classic hard bop from one of the master 's of the genre . the band here is the famous quintet of 1959-63 ( blue mitchell on trumpet , junior cook on tenor sax , gene taylor on bass ) with one exception -- john harris jr. replaces roy brooks on drums , who was ill at the time of this session . while `` the tokyo blues '' may not quite live up to `` song for my father , '' it is as good as anything else this quintet cut , including `` silver 's serenade , '' `` finger poppin '' and `` blowin ' the blues away .
this book is great . between the pictures and the sense of humor in the text , you ca n't help but smile
now , i 'm not trying to hate on the original . obviously , it 's a classic . but , come on . it 's boring . it 's black and white and slow . and i 'm sure it scared your parents and was shocking and all that good stuff . but it needed to be updated . the two main characters ( including the candyman ) deliver some great acting . i 'll admit the other characters are a bit weak , but that 's made up for by the zombies being incredible . this movie really shows ( by driving the point home a few times ) how humans do n't know how to treat each other . it 's not just a horror movie . it actually has a point to it and makes a humanitarian statement . rent it , buy it , whatever . but check it out . it 's a great movie
wow ! just wow ! i am impressed with this one . i was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when i first heard about this one , seeing how i normally associate tim meadows , with flat , not very funny , comedies , when he stars , and very vague cameo and side roles in other adam sandler and will ferrel main headliner movies ! but this one , wow ! he is really a talented individual ! i should n't be so quick to judge though . his role in boogie nights , also featured some wonderful comedic actors by mr. meadows , and he was the comic relief of that movie , featuring marky mark . i also like how this movie , once again paired up nick nolte and mr. meadows , for the first time since <NUM> hours ! nothing short of brilliance , i say ! while mr. meadow 's role was much more dramatic in hotel rwanda , keep in mind , he did show a sufficient amount of that `` angry black '' character he is famous for in <NUM> hours . definitely pick up this movie ! you wo n't be sorry ! mc white said : you 'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up , and memorize all of the main character 's names ! two thumbs way up ! ! !
i 'll make this short and sweet . i used to work in spin . i did advance , which is creating media events for politicians . in other words , for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information . i 'll let others speak to the eerie connections to orwell 's foresight . i 'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case . that which is represented in this piece is true . the observations are astute . the prognosis is grim . i wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers . buy it . watch it . watch it again . share it with friends .
this has pretty much summed up my own life story in mark 's great use of symphonic music intertwined with his brilliant fiddling dexterosity . i highly recommend this selection -- it is the story of his life put to music . i know him personally
look , i am not a dancer . and i am a classical , not a salsa musician . however , i found the disk quite entertaining and helpful . gigi and pedro do not come across as so elegant and skilled that it seems impossible for the average person to copy . yes , both know what they are doing and are quite fluent in what they communicate . the instruction on the disk allows you to watch their whole demonstration from beginning to end or go through each set of steps and turns lesson by lesson . you also have three choices of camera angle . the default is from in front . you can also choose looking down from above , or from the back . this multi-view method allows you to see things in the dance that a simple 2d presentation from the front actually hides . the names of the steps are given in spanish , but even if you do n't speak the language you will pick up on the names quickly ; it is not hard . i did miss the discussion of how to communicate dance steps through hand motions that i have seen in another salsa series . one is n't going to call out the names of the steps as gigi and pedro do throughout these disks . it is the subtle way one moves the hands and touches the partner that communicate what is to be done next and that is as much a part of learning the dance as the footwork . still , a pretty darn good set of instructional disks
this seems to follow a typical pattern of danny kaye movies : a zero turns into a hero . however , you 'll also find laughable moments like kaye 's other works . it 's funny , but it 's not one of his best movies . if you could see this for free , i 'd recommend watching it . otherwise , you might want to watch one of kaye 's other , higher quality movies .
the anthology is a very good collection of <NUM> live shows from bruce dickinson 's , pulled from many sources . dvd one has tattoo millionaire tour live footage ( dive dive dive ) , and skunkworks live . the dive video is poor quality shots , and the sound is not the greatest . my favorite is the skunkworks footage . that album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden . it 's good to the footage done when it was still fresh , and laugh at bruce trying to be `` alternative '' . disc two is just scream for me brazil in yet another package . good song set , playing bruce 's best solo work ever ( chemical wedding material ) , but it 's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens . pretty disapointing disc , could have been left out , made the package cost less , and no one would have missed it . this keeps this dvd from getting <NUM> stars disc three is the cool best part of this package . the promo videos are just nice to have in one spot . the tyranny of souls promo video is interesting , and where else are you going to find the samson footage . all of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video ( like knowing the `` tatooed millionaire '' video was directed by the pink floyd `` learning to fly '' directory ... now the connection is made ) . nice job with the last disc . overall , i feel the skunkworks video and the promo material are the best parts of this collection , and make it worth the <NUM> dollars i paid for this . i would suggest to all to try an pay under <NUM> dollars for this collection , because the bulk of these dvd 's is filler on disc two , and i would feel ripped off by it . if you have been a long time maiden/dickinson fan , get this anyway .
i had never heard of tom braxton before this cd and boy was i pleasantly surprised . this is definitely a nice album to listen to
this resource tool serves as a practical , easy to use guidebook for the work our teachers do designing performance assessments that parallel state assessments . spence has the ability to take complex concepts and translate them so that practitioners can make sense of the research and best practices . this is a & quot ; must read & quot ; for teachers striving to increase academic achievemnet for all students
there are far too few movies that are made just for fun these days . down periscope is proof that you do n't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie . my teenagers loved it , setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers . kelsey grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role , playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie . known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of admiral graham ( bruce dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well ) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub ( an old rusty diesel boat ) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern navy . fortunately grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone . the crew consists of stereotypes , from the flatulant cook , to the grizzled old veteran , to the spoiled son of an admiral , to the basketball star , to the spit-and-polish xo , but the actors manage to bring them off with charm , especially the electrician who grammer notes has `` absorbed a lot of voltage '' . in addition to the big laughs , there are the little scenes that bring a smile , such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to `` see if the other rooms are still tilted '' ultimately it is a feel-good movie . it does n't highlight any great moral conflicts , but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch ! of special note , san franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the `` mothball fleet '' in suisun bay and the docked sub shots of the `` stingray '' are the uss pampanito , a sub open for tours at pier <NUM> - you can even see the other piers at the end .
this story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success . whether success is a relationship , career , business , or any other endeavor , the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same . to put this in context , the <NUM> chicago bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era . while other teams may have had more success over time , or had <NUM> less loss , this team is widely regarded as the most dominating . in addition to the on-the-field success , the team created media stars like mike ditka , jim mcmahan and `` the fridge '' , along with established all time greats like walter payton , mike singletary and dan hampton . so what happened ? how did it blow up so fast ? a classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place . the players and the team became successful by playing harder , and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation . at first this focus ( the <NUM> defense , the frenetic play style ) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage , but like most of us with any kind of success , once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created . in addition , they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press , and became infatuated with their own greatness . once that happens , it slips away quickly . the detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team , are depicted clearly . after reading this book , which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other , it is hard to find where to place the blame . everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission . for the football fan , this is a great book , full of strategic detail and player reactions . for the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success , the lessons here are easy to see , though often difficult to avoid . the book is written exceptionally well , in that it flows easily , is always interesting , follows a nice chronological progressions , and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled .
common sense is a must read for all citizens of the usa and world seeking liberation from long established regimes . in this short , but well written published pre-revolutionary work , paine makes the argument for a complete separation from england . in a time when many were not sure separation was the correct option , thomas paine spells out <NUM> % revolution in clear english that provided the spark for the declaration of independence . it was the straw that broke the camel 's back and there would be no turning back . a true piece of fine usa history
i love watching the episodes without commercials . this show is the best !
a look inside the real world of modeling and it 's past and present stars . tons of information about the history of modeling in here . it drags on a little bit at times but is otherwise very interesting and entertaining . i 'd def recommend it to anyone in the biz or interested in becoming a part of it . :
my husband bought this for me <NUM> years ago and i wore it out . i absolutely love it . luckily he was able to find me another copy . i would buy more if i could find them
the boswell sisters were the 1st group to truly use jazz in vocal harmony , there arrangements by lead singer connie boswell were innovative , and full of jazz syncopations and the blues . this pioneering jazz vocal group would influence and pave the way for groups as diverse as lambert , hendricks & ross to todays take <NUM> . a great cd of great new orleans jazz harmony vocals . the bozzies are backed here by combos that feature such solosists as bunny barigan , eddie lang , joe venuti , jimmy & tommy dorsey , among others
this movie is one of those `` must own '' movies that belongs in anyone 's collection , and definitly should be included in every gay man 's movie cabinet .
i 've decided he 's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time i read one of his books . discworld currently has <NUM> titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off . his mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels , and i simply ca n't get enough of his writing . a reviewer has compared him to geoffrey chaucer . he reminds me more of douglas adams , or perhaps s morgenstern . great company , is n't it ? he 's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer , damn funny , clever and observant to boot . he 's also very easy to read . a master of characterization , and if there 's anything else you like about reading that i did n't mention here , assume i simply forgot . he 's awesome . another reviewer mentioned jonathan swift and pg wodehouse . why such hallowed company ? because pratchett belongs there ! truly , i 'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series . you should do the same , and begin your quest at the library because he 's got to be there . he 's awesome ! yet another reviewer said jerome k jerome meets lord of the rings . yeah , that works too . why do we , as reviewers , compare authors to other authors ? because it 's easier than thinking . in the case of terry pratchett , it 's probably because we 'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy . he 's so unique that we just do n't know how else to cope with his greatness . even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving , does n't it ? that 's how all readers react to pratchett . reviewers simply do n't have the good sense to keep it to themselves . i could call his writing fantasy , but i could likewise call what douglas adams wrote science fiction . in both cases , i would n't be wrong , but i 'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point . a rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they 're shouting out , loud and proud , a big fat `` bite me ! '' i love terry pratchett 's writing , and i completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author . or favourite , i should say , since we 're being british . he 's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever 's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud . i 'm simply thrilled that there 's such an extremely talented and prolific author who 's been working for years without me being aware of him . now i have much catching up to do , and i will love it .
eda goldstein does a great job of describing , in detail , ego psychology from a historical , theoretical , and practical perspective . i was particularly fond of part ii dealing with the ego and its functions and defenses . she writes with a clarity that is difficult to find when reading books dealing with detailed theoretical perspectives . i would highly recommend this book to socials workers and pyschologists alike . it is a wealth of information that you will find yourself referencing again and again
i am a law student who read this edition of blackstone 's commentaries for a jurisprudence course , and it was a great experience . blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among greek , roman , and civil law . he also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights , property , civil procedure , and criminal law in england . these sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law . in addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of england 's government at the time just before our nation 's independence and why it had been superior , at that time , to any other form of government in all of europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty . i highly recommend at least volume i to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government . his explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how english government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from england . any scholar , student , or avid reader of political science , law , or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work . ignore the earlier critique of the font , the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate . the only real difference is `` f '' is used in place of `` s '' everywhere but in the last letter of words ( `` greateft '' `` fortrefs '' `` fubject '' etc. ) . generally it 's very clear when the `` f '' is an `` s '' although there are a few confusing exceptions ( e.g . `` wife '' is `` wise '' as in the `` wife laws of england ... '' ) . the first edition included footnotes where blackstone cited english , latin , and roman works and these are reproduced here as well .
this release by `` 20th century masters '' is part two of their loretta lynn greatest hits compilation . this one covers the second part of her career , and like vol . <NUM> , the sound and recordings are clear and original . there are <NUM> songs here , beginning with `` wine , women , and song '' and `` fist city '' , and ending with `` i lie '' . in between , there is a duet with conway , and the controversial `` the pill '' . yes , there could 've been more songs included , or even more popular songs chosen instead of those provided here , but this is a solid offering that will not disappoint
thirty years ago dr. kassirer was my chief when i was a medical house officer in boston . ( that will serve as my disclosure of possible conflict of interest although we have had little contact since that time . ) he has been a wildly successful nephorlogist/researcher , clinician and teacher . as editor of the new england journal of medicine , he constantly expressed concerns over possible conflict of interest and its influence on published medical literature . this book is a highly researched and extensively documented look at conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in the medical literature and other closely related areas of medicine . sometimes there are situations where potential conflict of interest has little or no influence on our decision making . as amply documented in on the take , there are other times when conflict of interest may impact our decision making to the detriment of our patients . this book examines when and how the harmless potential conflict of interest moves into the realm of a serious , even ethical , dilemma . amazingly , these conflicts may extend beyond the published medical literature to consensus papers and clinical guidelines increasingly embraced by the government and major medical societies and these conflicts of interest may even intrude into organizations designed to protect the consumer like the fda ( food and drug administration ) and the cdc ( center for disease control ) . we as physicians minimize the extent to which potential conflicts of interest influence us in our medical practice - a view not widely shared by patients or government regulatory committees . dr. kassirer presents a number of suggestions to improve the situation . some of these are already being implemented by major medical journals . others will depend on the integrity of individual practitioners . this book should be a must-read for medical students - both those planning to do medical research and those who will use the medical research to guide their medical practices . martin g. kistin , m.d
this book compiles about <NUM> issues of spidey 's earlier adventures , going through many important chapters . it does n't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes , perhaps because most spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume . if you 're new to spidey , snag this ... if you 're not new , still get it to fill in your blanks = )
this book is so funny because of the character 's attitude . it even has strong words , like `` makintosh '' .but i like it best because it has poems that rhyme
if i was going to hire an escort he is the one i would want . penelope and brett made a great couple . her father -in- law wanted her to date again after losing her husband on a bucking bull . she has to convince him she has a boyfriend so he quits sending every eligible bachelor in town to her office . brett shows up and steals the show . he stands up to her father -in-law and wins the respect of the whole town . this is an excellent movie
before i read this book , i was a fanatic of the movie bambi . i still am , but it 's very different from the book and it seems like <NUM> minutes after you read the book . i could see everything that was described in the text of the book . it really has an effect on emotions . some things are lighthearted , some things are truly heart breaking , there 's even a few laughs . everything is described in much detail . i felt like , at one point , that i was bambi running for the first time in the meadow , drinking in the warm air . i could hear the dogs barking , the hoofbeats , and the gunshots . i highly recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film . now i just need to read bambi 's children
this a compelling true story in which anyone who reads it will be swept up . it is about three men , israel carmi , jochanan pelz and arie pinchuk , who form the jewish brigade , a division of jewish soldiers from israel , in the british army- '' the first official jewish fighting force since the fall of the judea to the roman legions '' . at the time when jews are being victimized and lead like sheep to the slaughter , the jewish brigade , with a yellow star of david emblazoned to their uniform , fighting for the jewish people , and their homeland of israel , shows the world that jews can fight back and win . it also tells the remarkable story of arie pichuk 's sister leah , and her escape from the nazis , surviving as a fugitive in the ukraine , before joining the anti-nazi partisans . after the war , the men witness first hand what the nazis have done to their people , and set off on a course of identifying , finding and killing nazi officers who have participated in the holocaust . their hatred and ferocity threatens to overwhelm them , until a chance encounter with an orphaned jewish girl sets them on a more constructive course-smuggling jewish boys and girls into israel , despite the british blockade which tires to prevent jews from entering the ancient homelnd from which they where forced out by the romans two thousand years before . it is therefore a true narrative about the re-establishment of the state of israel , where jewish children can grow up insafety and live as free men and women , in a free homeland of their own . that is zionism , which has been so maligned by evil forces , who want the jews to fall pray to genocide again . every descent person , jew or gentile , needs to dedicate themselves to ensuring that israel survives as a jewish state in which jews can live freely and safely . anything else will guarantee another holocaust . israel and the jewish people are faced with the same genocidal hate today , that the jews where faced with during world war ii our heroes play a role in defending israel after the fledgling state is attacked by five arab armies , hellbent on genocide . am israel chai . the people of israel live !
for anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they `` gave away '' ..... for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way ... have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better ... or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when `` feeling '' was what life was all about , this movie should be right up your alley . it is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times ....... and still like it
this is my 3rd book on real estate investing and i must say that each is totally different , with different ideas and different strategies . i think it 's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know . i like how she talks about goal setting , something i 've learned from tony robbins and that i feel is really important . i like how she calculates the rate of return . i like her differing point of views . i would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book . overall i learned a lot , despite having already read <NUM> other good books . a few things i did n't like : i would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties . and especially calculating if i can afford it or not . the information she gives is quite good , but since this is the most important topic i think it deserved even more . the book is well worth the price and if you 're serious about investing i highly recommend it .
i was shocked as i looked at this movie plenty of times and passed it up , until i read an article in fangoria # <NUM> article on stuart gordon , and decied to rent it . i would say the asking price is to high $ <NUM> is more reasonable . this movie does not get boring . the action is good , the plot is good , the acting is actually very good . this movie has already been broken down so no need for me to do so . overall if you are looking for a good movie that will keep you awake and interested check out `` king of the ants '' , it is a good flick and doubt you will be dissapointed i know i was'nt
these were my two favorite movies to watch on those all night parties back when i was in school , something good to have on in the background . dazed & confused -- the year is <NUM> . it 's the last day of school , and it 's time for the new seniors to do some hazing on the new freshmen ! paddling the guys with those wooden boards , and making the girls look like fools . now that 's that done , we spend the rest of the movie drivin around , getting dazed and confused ; hanging out at the pool hall ; and trying to find a party to go to . fast times at ridgemont high -- the year is <NUM> . sex , drugs , and rock n ' roll is the story of this movie . jeff spicoli is a surfer dude who always being harrassed by his scrict teacher : mr. hand . the teacher wo n't even let spicoli enjoy a pizza that he ordered in class ; no respect for stoners . we 've got other characters like brad hamilton who 's having a hard time finding himself in his senoir year , going from job to job - but he does find a cute girl swimming topless in a pool ( played by pheobe cates ) . his sister explores her sexual life . and of course , we have the nerd . like i said before , two awesome partying movies - like the name of the box set says
i have seen the movie and bought the sound track . having marinated my bones and psyche with tibetans for over <NUM> years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures , america and mongolia . as music is the one art form that transcends cultures , it is intersteing to hear the blues united with their asian cousins . the phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in tibetan monks chanting with the ability to produce two tones simultaneously . paul pena , a black , blind , blues singer from california , copped their gig and taught himself how to do this . he went to tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category . it is an exposure of the roots . like mongolians do n't get the blues . for any armchair anthropoligist , this cd is a must . the movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that paul faces , distantly empowered by the deceased physicist , richard feinman , who went to tuva on his last journey . paul 's trip is peppered with stickers that they paste up , & quot ; feinman lives & quot ; feinman was a great thinker from far rockaway , n.y. who collected stamps from tuva as a child . this record is strange and profound . irresistable for any thinking person
first of all , i would like to say in my behalf that i 'm no logic expert , and that i had to cut popper 's book in chapter <NUM> just to read an introduction to logic before i continue further in my personal experience with popper . this book is a classical one , i had just seen references to it before , so i decided to give it a try . boy , i was so out of my territory i felt really confused at times , but finally manage to get through the technical issues . this was a hard reading book for me , but i do n't regret the month i devote to it , all the effort was worth it . so , why do i gave it four stars then ? well , just because it was hard , sorry , i do n't have a better argument , but it 's true , if you do n't poses a solid background in logic this would be a hard reading . i 'm not going to talk much about this book content since i do n't like that much , and everybody seems to do that , there 's even some really good reviews in this page that make a better job that the one i could . finally i will like to say that if you are interested in the philosophy behind scientific work , this is a wonderful book
being an animal lover , a volunteer dog walker at our local shelter and a cat owner , i always read non-fiction books relating to animals and amazing gracie will be one of my favorites that i will remember . the author 's writing made it so i did n't want to put the book down , it made me laugh , cry , and educated about adopting an all natural diet for our pets . it prompted me to purchase the other three books about `` three dog bakery '' to learn more and as i already knew , people who love animals can make wonderful things happen in their lives as well as their pets . now we need a `` three dog bakery '' in milwaukee , wisconsin
excellent work from a local band from my own hometown . very unique stuff to say the least - i know of nothing that compares . though you should check this out if you dig hank iii 's new album , or vice-versa . dark country at its best
another great cd by zombie . every song is good ; no skipping tracks on this cd
this dvd/cd combo is a very worthy effort by coheed and cambria . it includes all of their hit songs and they are a joy to watch live . the only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the dvd is sub-par . this doesnt mean that it is bad , it just isnt the kind of quality i would expect from a big time band like coheed and cambria . even though the audio isnt that great , i still watch the thing all the time . the best part of this package is the cd that comes along with it . this is worth buying this product alone . i suggest putting the cd on full blast and watching the dvd on mute . all in all i give the dvd <NUM> out of <NUM> and the cd <NUM> out of <NUM> which averages out to a decent <NUM> . this should hold anyone that needs a coheed fix until they put out their next c
`` the beatles - the capitol albums vol i '' . . . i had to get a copy of this box-set collection of the first four american issued albums by `` the mop tops '' . i was a sophomore in high school that year when the beatles first entered into the consciousness of the world . . . and these four albums re-present exactly the `` sounds '' we first heard in our experience of the band that changed music forever . `` meet the beatles '' . . . where we first saw the `` mop top hair styles '' and the half-lit faces we would eventually come to know better than our own face . . . and where we first heard `` i want to hold your hand '' ! `` the beatles ' second album '' . . . with their cover of `` please mr. postman '' . `` something new '' . . . with so many tracks that became synonymous with `` the beatle movie '' -- `` a hard day 's night '' . . . `` beatles '65 '' . . . my absolute favorite beatles album . . . and the one that was current in my last year of high school . . . with my favorite `` no reply '' . . .and that feedback amp noise that introduces `` i feel fine '' . for me this collection of american issued albums from the original master tapes is nostaligia . . . so many memories associated with these album covers . .and the song sequences . .and even the `` echo '' quality to the sound reproducton . . . but it is much much more . . . these were great songs and great performances and great recordings ! when you listen to them even now , you realize why the beatles were so special and such a phenomenon . . . and why they probably will never be equaled ( although there have been and are and will be many contenders trying to do that ) . i am glad these albums were issued in their origianl format and sound . . . and i am glad that i lived my youth through the times when all of this was `` live '' . . . now we only have the recordings . . . but what great recording they are ! : ) thank you john , paul george and ringo !
dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather , the divorce of his parents , and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up , 16-year-old john grady cole heads for mexico with his friend lacey rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen . they find a hard , darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer . cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed , and he needs to be . every time he shows love or compassion for another , he is made to suffer for it , and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere . cormac mccarthy 's prose style is challenging at first , but i soon grew accustomed to it . his long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel , and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the texas/mexico border region to vivid life .
an armored car driver ( burt lancaster ) involves himself in a robbery scheme in order to protect both himself and his ex-wife ( yvonne de carlo ) , whom he still loves and is now married to a local gangster ( dan duryea ) . this is a hard , uncompromising example of film noir , featuring great performances and generating true suspense . the finale of this film is certainly no cop-out and demonstrates that , although films of the 40s were not as graphic as those of today , they were nevertheless often edgier and tougher than most of what comes out now
whut ? thee album was better than any solo effort from e-double . it hurts me to admit that becuase i am a huge fan of erick sermon , but i have to say it . i consider reggie on the top ten list . he ( in my opinion ) is one of hip hops finest lyricists ! ! ! everything about this record was good . his creativitly & humor , hardcore raps , etc . you all really should include this in your next purchase . high quality hip hop material , no filler what-so-ever . a
i loved the movie in the way it is not too grose for children to watch , but is has suspence , mistery , ghosts and other paranormal all mixed into one . easy to follow and loved the amount of background informatio
in this <NUM> disc set , the five antoine doinel films are released . all are by françois truffaut . the first film , `` the <NUM> blows '' or `` le quatre cents coups '' was previouslly released by the criterion collection but was taken out of print until this version was released . truffaut based it loosely on his own troubled adolescence . it follows <NUM> year old antoine doinel 's youth playing hooky from school , later running away from home and eventually sent to a juvenile deliquent center . the second film `` antoine and collette '' or `` '' antoine et colette '' was originally a segment of a film titled `` l'amour à vingt ans '' or `` love at twenty '' it follows his life as he is in his late teens working in a phonograph record factory . the third film , `` stolen kisses '' or `` baisers volés '' covers his dishonorable discharge from the army , his reunion with his girlfriend , and subsequent attempts to find a steady job the fourth film , `` bed & board '' or `` domicile conjugal '' skips ahead to after he is married . it covers his wife 's pregnancy , his son 's birth , and an adulterous affair he has with a japanese woman . the fifth and final film , `` love on the run '' or `` l'amour en fuite '' covers the process of his divorce and reunion with an ex flame . the films wer made between <NUM> and <NUM> and jean-pierre léaud reprises his role for each film . the films are very impressive and quite rare for there to be series like this . each film has some fine secenes and some interesting comedy . the acting is good and many scenes are well photographed . the box set has some excellent special features also . out of the five discs , four are numbered . for describing the special features , i will list the unnumbered disc as the last one . disc one contains the first two films . <NUM> blows and antoine & colette . the supplements for the <NUM> blows are similar to ones in the out of print version . there are two audio commentaries . one is by film professor , brian stonehill and the other is by robert lachenay who was a lifelong friend of françois truffaut . the commentary by lachenay is in french with subtitles . there is also audition footage for three of the child actors in the film . jean-pierre léaud who played antoine , patrick auffay , who played rene , and richard kanayan who played abbou . there is also footage of jean-pierre at the cannes film festival for the screening of the film and a theatrical trailer . there are also two television interviews with françois truffaut about the making of the film . it also contains the short film , antoine and colette . disc two contains the film stolen kisses along with the following special features : there is news footage of truffaut 's participation in the sucessful attempt to shut down the <NUM> canne film festival to support students and striking workers , a tv spot of truffaut and jean-luc goddard showing ther support for cinémathèque française founder , henri langlois at a time when his job was in jeopardy , news footage of french cinema vip 's protesting against the planned removal of henri langlois from his job , excerpts from a tv interview with truffaut discussing actor jean-pierre léaud 's portrayal of antoine , and a video introduction to the film and events surrounding its release presented by film historian serge toubiana . disc three contains the film bed and board with the following supplements : behind the scenes footage with interviews of some of the cast & crew , a tv interview with jean-pierre talking about the film being the last in the series ( before truffaut decided to make the fifth and final film , ) a tv interview with truffaut and bernard revon discussing how the write the scripts , and a scene from a truffaut documentary where he discusses the character of antoine doinel . disc four contains the final film in the series love on the run along with the following truffaut and marie-france pisier talking about their work on the film and their feelings about the film , scenes of a tv interview with truffaut talking about his feelings on ending the series , there is also a theatrical trailer . the final unnumbered disc contains : françois truffaut 's <NUM> short film , `` les mistons '' or `` the mischief makers '' about some young teenage boys who attempt to sabotage the relationship of an older couple . the film also has oprional audio commentary by claude de givray . it is in french with english subtitles . there is also a primer for the film presented by serge toubiana , a noted film historian . there is also a <NUM> minute interview with co-writers claude degivray and bernard revon . a scene from a <NUM> documentary titled `` françois truffaut , '' a <NUM> tv interview with truffaut , and a slide show of movie posters for the four feature length doinel films . this set is a must buy for those who like the series as well as criterion collectors , and fans of françois truffaut 's work
i have to give atb hard props on this album ! ! ! this is one of most listened to cds ever . if you are into deep chiller trance this has got to be a must for every techno , trance , and elektronica lover out there ! !
true to the topic , it transports you right there . historical and old , but still current
people snicker when i mention skee-lo b/c they do n't understand what an incredible complete and great album this is . this is one of the best albums i have ever bought
since i am one of the characters involved i can truly say that pete earley captures the events more precise than those of us on the inside looking out . the chilling things he describes are true , and the scary part is they are still happening , everyday . it is a must read for anyone truly interested in how the justice system really works
i purchased the re-mastered version , and it sounds like it is live , i.e , you are there , only clearer . the songs are breathtaking , heart-breakingly lovely , and overflowing with joy , like a cool spring breeze blowing on you with the hot sun above . sorry , pat -- i think i broke that one getting it out .
sundown towns goes a long way towards explaining the us ' pervasive racial problems by examining a phenomenon many white people had thought dead and gone : sundown towns ( cities or neighborhoods where racial minorities were not allowed to live or even be present after dark ) . it would be tempting to dismiss loewen 's research as merely anecdotal , but obviously more concrete evidence can rarely be found : even the most racist townships took care to mask their anti-black and minority rules through sleight of hand and legal double speak , and city limit signs that used to warn minorities not to linger after dark have now mostly vanished , but there is simply too much material here to ignore . and the honest reader will have to admit that much of what loewen writes about sounds familiar . we 've all heard excuses for why blacks and whites tend to live separately : the blacks like it that way , they do n't care about good schools and nice houses , etc , etc . we 've also heard plenty of `` blame the victim '' stories indicating that it is black laziness and racial inferiority that prevents them from moving to the suburbs . and we 've all heard other whites making disparaging comments about minorities and not protested , thus becoming tacitly complicit . reading some of loewen 's stories about the race riots and lynchings that helped create the sundown towns , reminded me of some of the histories of the nazi rise to power in germany during the 1920s and 1930s . so many of the methods for dealing with despised groups , whether whites against blacks or nazis against jews , are terrifyingly similar : economic boycotts , terror bombings , sabotage , etc . and the language used by so called `` white patriots '' warning of the threat posed by black migration to an area reminded me of nothing so much as the screams of osama bin laden and his followers for the annihilation of the west to defend islam . ( yet another reminder that we humans are all indeed `` brothers under the skin ! '' ) i already knew i lived near one of the more infamous sundown counties , but as i read this book i began to suspect that some other communities and neighborhoods i 'm familiar with may be sundown as well , and that 's something i intend to investigate for myself . as a southerner with long ancestral roots in the former slave owning regions , i have always been aware of the dark history of race relations there . it was with some surprise ( and i hope a forgiveable amount of satisfaction at seeing such hypocrisy revealed at long last ) that i read that sundown towns were and are far more pervasive in the north and west , and that the southern states , far from being exceptions to a rule of general tolerance , were merely the most prominent examples of nationwide intolerance . loewen provides some excellent reasons for why sundown towns are bad for their residents as well as the people they keep out : the cultural aridity , the fostering of racial stereotyping , the unwillingness to try new ideas or customs . and he ably restates what the supreme court said in the brown decision back in <NUM> : segregation has a degrading , scarring emotional and physical toll that makes it completely unacceptable . lowewen suggests some interesting methods for confronting and hopefully putting an end to the sundown phenomenon , including a call for a residents ' rights act that i fear will take a seismic shift in national politics to ever have a chance of becoming law . ( to start with we 'd need a president and vice-president who do n't live in sundown towns themselves ! ) more realistic suggestions emphasize action by concerned volunteers willing to research and ask the difficult questions needed to shock the many out of their complacency . this is n't a comfortable book to read , but it may come to be considered as important as gunnar myrdal 's an american dilemma in helping americans deal with the quandaries of creating a truly equal multi-racial society
i first saw laura as a young woman , but i had not seen it for many years . however , the aura of laura remained with me through those years . i decided to buy it after i had seen a screening of it . i was reminded of why i liked it so much . the stars are real and convincing . gene tierney was beautiful as the mysterious laura . dana andrews was handsome and to my present-day eyes , very convincing as the astute detective mcpherson . vincent price is a real charmer as the erstwhile fiance shelby . clifton webb is charming as he always was as waldo . otto preminger was a wonderful director and kept the story tight and convincing with all of his characters . the scenery was limited and tightly held . i was particularly intrigued by the rain ; it rained constantly , and some of the most interesting dialogue occurred during the various rainstorms . laura has become my most watched dvd because i 'm constantly seeing little things that i missed before . in addition , i adore the apartments of laura and waldo because they were decorated then pretty much as i want to decorate now . waldo 's bathroom is to die for . incidentally , i watch the extended version because i love looking at gene tierney 's wardrobe .
while this might not be for everyone , it is something to behold . i happened upon the ' o ' show , as she spoke about it ( wayback when ) and i was very intrigued . before that episode ended , my order was being placed for the dvd version , here . i purchased the cd version , after watching the movie . it was beyond words ( i found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie ) and i 'm incorporating the secret in my life as well as my family . i listen to the cd version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work , at night . it has helped me immensely and i 'll continue to do so . i 'm so very glad that i decided to check here for the hardcover book ... hooray , the price has been reduced ... yipeee ! i 'll get that as soon as i 'm done with this review . thanks rhonda byrne and aloha from hawaii
the story is about a young boy called jp whose life falls apart after his grandmther 's death , but chaos really starts to heat up when they win an old farmhouse . soon the house is ffilled with people he can not stant they are against all the morals he believees a person shold have . so at first jp defies his mother and ehr group of friends , then he tries to fit in but either way he can not . everything jp holds dear and dependalble unraveld withen the firdays at his new home so he is left with nothing but the bare threads of his once normal life . while this happened his mother and her group of lost friends are starting to weave the threads belonging in ther lives and to find themselves . the books strength is that the book grabs the floor benth you and there is no cushio to soften the fall on the hard really on the issues of love
i 'm not very familiar with the books of daniel handler ( lemony snicket ) but , even by judging this film alone , i 'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than harry potter . the kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round . the story centers on three adorable and gifted children who 're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire . their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious count orlaf ( jim carrey ) who hunts after the bauedelaires ' family fortune . the main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child , namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians . most fairy-tale do n't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea , but `` lemony snicket ... '' entirely revolves around it . equally effective are , of course , the ghoulish landscapes , the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters . most of the time , it feels like you 're watching a typical tim burton film and that 's a giant compliment , since his style is practically unique ( sinister , witty and heart-warming all at once ! ) . there 's a lot of cgi here but not to the point to annoy you , since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects ( the leeches , aunt josephine 's seaside-house ) contribute to the morbid atmosphere . the cast is terrific as well , with jim carrey as count orlaf in one most memorable performance to date . i have to admit i initially feared that carrey 's performance would be far over-the-top , but he 's surprisingly mature and convincing . the bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are billy connolly and meryl streep in the most important supportive roles . the great cast is completed with respectable names ( luiz guzmï¿½n , catherine o'hara , jennifer coolidge , cedric the entertainer ... ) in small roles . sublime film . it 's funny , it 's interesting , it 's creative ! i recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art , if you like jim carrey , and if you like unique plots , highly recommended for all type of audiences !
i am a big fan of alan jackson , and & quot ; who i am & quot ; is , in my opinion , his best cd . there are two excellent re-makes of earlier songs on this cd , & quot ; summertime blues & quot ; and & quot ; thank god for the radio & quot ; , and they are both very good . i especially like jackson 's guitar playing on & quot ; summertime blues & quot ; . this cd spawned several other hits as well , such as & quot ; livin ' on love & quot ; , & quot ; gone country & quot ; , & quot ; i do n't even know your name & quot ; , and the title track . all songs on this cd are typical jackson : great ballads intermixed with some fun , up-tempo songs . this disc has a little bit for everybody . country fans are sure to enjoy this fine cd from alan jackson
i bought this movie last year on a hum bug . this movie really surprised me . i really enjoyed it . my daughters love it as well . we watch it constantly and the soundtrack is awesome too
can you believe i just saw this movie . i had the pleasure of listening to liz murray at an awhonn convention . it 's not even that she is a seasoned speaker ... she told her story . i instantly was drawn to her . if you think you have problems ... well you can hardly believe someone could overcome all that she has . i left that convention with a whole different attitude about life . i can hardly wait for my girls to watch it , because all i have done is talk about her
this dvd is great for adults and children alike ... filled with hours of pluto !
i acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating . ann coulter is a conservative genius . she pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else . she is intelligent , and makes very good arguements . the only reason this book got <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> is because the last chapter was a bit dull . this is some of her earlier writing , and therefore was not the best . she should have put this chapter closer to the beginning , so it would n't be the last thing the reader remembers . other than the last chapter , this book is filled with great humor , while still being informative and making her arguements . she includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias ( even though they say they do n't ) ... this book should be on everyone 's must read list ! !
i saw her in concert and the next night i drove to another state to see her again . wow , she does sound better than her recordings . her voice is so sweet it brought tears to my eyes . genre ? i love jazz , folk , blues ... hey , its roots . she 's beautifully and purely lizz . i ca n't wait till she gets back to the states . you ca n't hold a moon beam in your hand
this is one of the better movies i 've seen in quite awhile . it is a love story , but not your typical love story . the love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from alzheimers . the biggest selling point of the cast is ms. rachel mcadams . i saw her in wedding crashers and i 've been anxious to see more of her work . she is gorgeous and she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie . i predict her as one of hollywood 's up & coming stars ( at least i hope so ! ) . for a guy whose father suffers from alzheimers , this movie really hit home . an interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young ( their courtship ) and the period of their golden years . this is a must-see movie , even for people who do n't normally care for `` mushy '' movies . in a single word , this story is unforgettable .
starting in <NUM> , the new york city program in ballroom dance now includes <NUM> children from all burroughs of the city . this documentary observes <NUM> year olds learning body discipline , social etiquette , appropriate attire on their way to achieving a sense of self respect , personal dignity . some of the children inhabit neighborhoods where they stumble across drug addicts and dealers each day . the teachers of <NUM> different schools reveal secret tricks to overcome physical and social awkwardness in children and open them to their potential for becoming accomplished through structure , practice and smiling . the children openly discuss their fears ( my dad cheated on my mom ) and hopes ( do you like girls ? ) between classes as they march toward the selection process for the citywide competition ( bronze , silver , gold levels ) quarter , semi-finals and the glorious finals outdoors in sunlight . the music is charming nostalgic , the dancing exhilarating ; the children 's enjoyment of their bodies in motion is contagious . recommend also seeing the original japanese dvd shall we dance ? to see the transformative power of dance to change adult self image and relationships .
this ( <NUM> edition ) is an updated re-publication of davies ' <NUM> book . in the new preface , davies ( mathematical physicist , prolific writer , recipient of the faraday prize , the kelvin medal , and the templeton prize ) suggests the possibility of something quite outlandish -- that if humanity can somehow survive the full future of the universe , that upon the universe 's thermodynamic and quantum demise , our descendants might scramble into a new universe of their own manufacture . the assertion brings several thoughts to mind , we might begin with , well , let 's say , idea-heisting [ i 'll not say plagiar_sm , that would be a bit harsh ] . ( frank tipler famously envisioned this kind of scenario in a universe headed for a `` big crunch . '' the big crunch has currently fallen out of favor with astronomers and theorists , and davies ' invented universe envisions the currently favored thermodynamic `` big fade away '' scenario . ) it also might strike us as unrealistic or even arrogant ; but , foolish or not , davies ' reason for such 'optimism ' is unveiled in the following <NUM> pages . what follows is a fast-paced and critical tour-de-force of the state of current and emerging scientific theories and prospects ( promising and otherwise ) for the future . there are many outstanding discussions , one centered on the mathematics of self-similar scaling -- the `` mandelbrot set '' being a famous example . davies believes that , in principle , science will one day explain , comprehensively , how the world works . do n't hold your breath , we 're not exactly close to that day just yet . in some significant areas , notably the deepest theoretical understandings of biological and mind sciences , there seems to have been rather little progress at all . from popular treatments [ like glossy spreads in national geographic magazine , or discovery channel shows ] , one might be led to believe that great insights have been gained into how biological evolution proceeds and how life arises spontaneously from non-life . davies surveys the competing claims and theories in these disciplines and exposes them as being starkly impotent to date . ( there is a popular myth that only religious fundamentalists are skeptical of the neo-darwinian story line -- but many of the most penetrating minds of modern theoretical science and mathematics , including werner heisenberg , niels bohr , john von neumann , and kurt godel , among others , have found the darwinian story to be non-compelling at best , and on some points glaringly wrong . as davies points out , a world in which 'natural selection ' was the great generative engine , supporting only reproductive advantages , many life forms that we observe , like elephants [ low birth rate , long gestation period , etc ] , could not have been 'selected ' into existence . it does no good to protest that elephants should not and could not reproduce like bunnies -- in a truly darwinian world there simply should not be elephants [ or humans : striving to discern whether the universe might be headed toward a 'big crunch ' or a 'heat death ' can offer no reproductive advantage for beings given to contemplating such things ! ] . one thinks of many darwin-confuters in the plant kingdom . a world built by darwinian mechanisms would be populated only by masters of mitosis , and perhaps sex-maniacs that mated like bunnies , although sex itself , a comparatively inefficient means of reproduction [ obviously when compared to mitotic reproduction ] , is another intractable problem for the darwinian story . ) davies , like many noted physicists , is well studied and articulate in theoretical biology , and finds the state of neo-darwinian evolutionary theory to be mostly a patched-up , just-so story that is easy fodder for skepticism . he does , however , believe that stuart kaufmann 's ideas concerning holistic approaches to understanding complexity may be more fruitful . however i give a wrong impression if i seem to suggest that the book is largely about biological evolution , it is not . this is but one of several illuminating discussions , most of which understandably center on mathematical physics . davies , an epistemological optimist at any rate , expects that theoretical biology and mind science will one day succumb to our advancing knowledge , and that we will know , exhaustively , how the world works . but to know how the world works is not to know why the world works . even if science should attain a reductionistic `` theory of everything '' and a stunning cadre of holistic theories explaining all features of 'emergence ' and 'complexity ' , the big why question ( s ) will remain , and any answers will remain as matters of faith , not strict science . science speaks to `` how , '' but why should this be so ? why should there be an explainable world and why should it contain world-explainers ? one can deny teleological inference and many materialists insist [ religiously ] on doing so , but the denial is one of personal choice , not actual science . the world is 'up to something , ' and this fact is fundamentally written into the new physics . the mysterious profundity of `` why '' always remains . in the day that davies foresees , when physical science has achieved its final triumph , it will not have dispensed with god and it will not have written purpose out of the world . well , that 's the book in a nutshell , but there 's much more to it . i 've read something like ten of davies ' books ; most of them being either 'good ' or 'very good ' ( with one notable exception ) and this volume fits either category , except , perhaps , for that wild assertion in the new preface
you did n't think you 've seen the last of `` the annoying thing '' , did you ? well now he 's back and better than ever with an all-new album featuring the new hit single `` we are the champions ( ding-a-dang-dong ) '' based on the song by queen . other songs include `` i will survive '' , `` ice ice baby '' , and `` copa banana '' . in comparison to the uk import album , the us album exclusively has revamped versions of eiffel <NUM> 's `` blue ( da ba dee ) '' and rednex 's `` cotton-eyed joe '' , two of my favorites . the uk album , however , exclusively has froggy versions of `` i 'm too sexy '' and `` the final countdown '' , as well as the full version of `` go froggy go '' , the bizarre `` crazy jodeling '' , and the even more bizzare `` nellie the elephant '' . also there 's `` super crazy sounds '' which sounds so totally mixed up and around , if you know what i mean . either way , i like this new album a whole lot . better than the first , even
this album is without any doubt one of the most original cds i have ever heard . the success in which kearney mixes musical styles is astounding . what makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies , good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks . there is so much here that one most listen to the album a good <NUM> or <NUM> times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work .
i came here speak no english . i learn english from just this book . i can read and write english . very good book . i thank author
this film is so sweet and whimsical . the cultural aspects depicted in the film are what amused me the most . the two love stories intertwined into one main plot is very well put together . this has been my favorite film for several years now and just watching it again made me remember just how much i love it . i highly recommend this international film for those who like to venture into other cultures for entertainment . this is a must see ! love some of the music as well !
mr. minter comes through again with a hard hitting reporting style that comes up with stories that are n't reported adequately elsewhere in the media . taking investigative journalism to places that other pontificators only dream about richard minter tells more stories about the war on terror that americans need to read . in a style somewhere between tom clancy and bill gertz , minter delivers style and prose that is easy on the brain , flowing and captivating . i was glued to the pages . it was an enjoyable read that provided a great perspective into many under-reported aspects of the war . his bias leaks through as a conservative and hawkish but the prose does n't come across as an ideologue . he backs his information up with interviews and facts and provides supportive information that i found to be entirely persuasive . the material is well researched and he presents an exceptional bibliography for further reading . this is a book that everyone should read , conservatives and democrats alike . minter finds pieces and interviews that no one else has and this niche makes for great exploration of the subject materials at hand .
mr. parker 's first album with this group , o'neal 's porch , rightfully received excellent reviews , appearing on ny times top <NUM> list , and so on . the group did release another album a couple years ago with a vocalist , so this is essentially the second album featuring only the quartet . it was released in late march by aum fidelity through their website , which is why i , and it seems the below reviewer , have heard this cd many times . i 've listened to it almost every day for the past month , and i still look forward to listening it . parker has said that he would like his orchestra to sound like a quartet- no easy feat considering the huge sound of it . at times i feel like this quartet sounds like an orchestra , and not because they play particularly loud or aggressive . as a matter of fact , this album is in many ways very straight ahead , full of melodies , walking bass , in the pocket drumming , and intertwined sax and trumpet . the reason i say that it sounds like an orchestra is that sometimes you can just hear something bigger than the four players . it has nothing to do with volume . it might be that they play so naturally , effortlessly , and with such confidence in each other , that they become not only `` a whole greater than the sum '' , but an entire new entity . that may seem like hyperbole , but anyone who has seen william parker play live knows that many strange things are possible . more simply put , i think anyone can listen to this album and right away `` get it '' . this is not avant-garde , or free , or straight ahead , or whatever other label there is . it is excellent music- and it also makes my crappy hour long commute somewhat enjoyable .
lonely hearts of the cosmos is the greatest book every written about the search for ultimate answers about the universe . but the science is secondary to the gallery of scientists who are revealed in all their pettiness , persistence and ultimately greatness . the story of allan sandage - from boyhood dreamer to discoverer of mysteries - could be a book in itself . this is a book of almost poetic prose - a real page-turner that i could n't set down . get it toda
only negative so far is that i wish the stretches would each last a little longer . otherwise , it 's thorough , not too difficult , and tamilee is very informative , serene , and motivating . highly recommend
houston is doing it big . slim thug , pall wall , chamillionare and mike jones . all there albums are great . but slim thugs sticks out due to the neptunes.like a boss would n't have the same attitude if the neptunes hadnt made the beat . 1.like a boss 2.click clack 3.3 kings 4.already platinum 5.i aint heard of that
how to think like leonardo da vinci was a book i was required to read for a class and honestly was not thrilled about , but i ended up loving it ! if you have any interest in da vinci , this is a good book to read , and even if you do n't , it will make you think more about what kind of thinker you are .
this , ladies and gentlemen , may be the best vocal jazz album i have ever heard ( i say have heard because i 've only listened to maybe fifteen albums in the genre ) . by just destroying any credentials i had in the previous statement , lets move on to the review . this is a west coast jazz classic , truly one of the most overlooked outputs of the cool school of jazz . while not as technically competant as `` kind of blue '' , i manage to listen to it just as much , if not more . every song included on this disc is a classic standard , and baker 's version of `` my funny valentine '' is the greatest version of the song , beating out sinatra 's rendition by a mile . the instrumentation itself is flawless , as mr. baker 's trumpet playing guides the band . he was as adept at the trumpet as he was at singing . the low-key and minimalist style of the band is perfect for the songs , and is one of the best bands in jazz history . influential and flawless , this is a must-have for any fan of post-war jazz
i do n't know how i missed this jewel until now , but i 'm glad i finally found it . i have n't been this moved by a work of fiction in a long , long time . i found myself so drawn to charlie and to what was happening to him , to his longing for acceptance and love , and to his quest to make sense of his world . the desire for acceptance and love -- from oneself and from others -- is something all people have in common regardless their iq . i cried as charlie regressed , all the while knowing what was happening to him , realizing the profundity of his loss , yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science . i ca n't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book 's ending was predictable . for a while , i thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love . when fay put the female mouse in with algernon , i kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out , first with the mouse , later with charlie . one possible ending would have been to let charlie have his high iq but , unlike algernon , be able to integrate intellect with emotion . another ending would have been to go back to the lower iq , and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone . this of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book 's end and were able to truly take charlie in and befriend him . i think the author came up with a good ending by causing charlie to lose the intellect , but to have gained self-love and the love of others , things he did not have at the start of his journey .
the ross sisters-amber , sarah & julia- who make up everlife- rock out on their self- titled cd ! bright , sharp & upbeat these girls outdo most of the young male rock bands around today . i enjoy every track on the cd but especially enjoy what i like about you , now or never , and the ballad angels cry . the latter song- harkens back to their christian rock roots and is very uplifting and inspiring ! it should be noted that the girls write many of the songs on the cd and play guitars as well . this is not a manufactured act but a real band ! this cd deserves to be a big hit- buy it now
best comedy since bbcs the office . fantastic details . can watch it over and over again , and discover new things every time
little britain is quite simply the funniest comedy out there today . i laughed till i cried . these guys are amazing and have created unforgettable characters that you want to see again and again , in new surroundings dealing with their same problems , like we all must do . if you have a strong stomach and a courageous sense of humor , you will love little britain
i picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like <NUM> years before this dropped and knew i had to have it . im so pleased w/ this album ( and all of supas music ) that everytime i listen to it i like it a little more . one of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it 's over . i just got deadline in the mail today and it 's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds ive listened to this year . you can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving . a true masterpeice and future classic
this is a really good movie with an excellent excellent screenplay . the movie begins with the birth of punk , when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the sex pistols when they first came out , changing the course of music , and ends with the death of acid . as tony wilson puts it in the film , it is the `` story of manchester , '' that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw london and its record companies and start producing their own records out of manchester , and boy , has music history benefited from this decision . it 's interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in manchester began to age , they become less idealistic as they were in their youth , and more acknowledging of reality and its limits . my only complaint is that i wish the movie could have had more on joy division and new order , than on the happy mondays . why did tony wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in manchester 's battle of the bands ? ? ? the casting for this movie is outstanding , as well . two big thumbs up . p.s . i do n't know why they used the cover that they did for the dvd . it really has nothing to do with the film
this really is a comprehensive , excellent instruction book and it is appropriate for people at all levels of cake decorating experience . toba garrett covers everything from start to finish and at the end of each lesson she provides a self-quiz that will help you see how much you have learned , practice each technique and make sure you understand the terminology that goes with this exciting career/hobby . i teach cake decorating at a local craft store and i own my own cake decorating business and toba is an inspiration and my absolute favorite cake decorator . if you want to learn anything about the art of cake decorating , this book is worth the price ! it could replace all the other cake books in my library all at once . oh - and the recipes are fabulous too ! try the chocolate fudge cake recipe if you like chocolate cake , it 's out of this world . i want to mention that the recipes have the ingredient measurements for both a 5-6 quart mixer and a <NUM> quart mixer for those who are starting a kitchen with bigger equipment .
while i 'm not always a big fan of the musical-esque style of disney movies ( although the kids love it , and that 's what matters ) , sleeping beauty is one of the best orchestrated films i can remember . george bruns does a brilliant job of arranging tchaikovsky 's score from the sleeping beauty ballet . the recording itself is decently remastered , and the small ensemble performing is excellent . mary costa 's vocals are flawless and almost supernatural . if ever there were a disney soundtrack to own , this would be it
this was the most sophisticated popular music that i heard when i was young . joshua rifkin , who also plays piano rags by scott joplin on another record , arranged and conducted this music . `` both sides now '' ( win and lose are a strange trip in this song ) was a hit on the radio for years , competing with `` walk away renee '' and `` pretty ballerina '' by the left banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music . i soon bought the judy collins songbook with <NUM> songs that included eight of the songs on `` wildflower . '' the first musical thing i notice about these songs now is how often i hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes . the first song , `` michael from mountains '' by joni mitchell is in the key of e-flat , with a short introduction that repeats f g f g f g in the treble clef before judy collins starts singing those notes . the second song , `` since you 've asked '' by judy collins , which seems to be in e-minor , starts with an e and d alternating an octave higher over an e-minor7th chord , dropping through b-minor to a c chord with e d e d e d e in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to `` michael ... '' but with enough g , a sus.4 , d9 , a-minor7th , and b chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music . the words on such simple lines , `` take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood , all the willow winding paths leading up and outward , this is what i give . . . `` are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen . `` sisters of mercy '' by leonard cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and french horns . there is certainly more going on than i can describe . judy collins had done `` suzanne '' on an earlier album , `` in my life , '' and the combination of judy singing leonard cohen songs worked so miraculously that `` wildflowers '' took it in a very religious direction . `` priests '' has <NUM> verses , with the third verse : and who will shoot the arrow that men will follow through your grace . and when i 'm lord of memories and all your armor has turned to lace . the music seems a lot more complicated than a trill , possibly in b-flat-minor , with the notes between the staffs alternating between b-flat and a-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to c-flat . if you have never heard `` la chanson des vieux amants '' by jacques brel and gerard jouannest , you might not realize how sophisticated french popular songs had been before this album pushed american radio up to international standards . big bands had been popular once in the united states , and american music during world war ii might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer , but i lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that , when perry como and dean martin could have used a few more hits . there are some distinct instrumental voices which make the brel song on `` wildflowers '' interesting , but brel often worked with gerard jouannest to achieve musical complexity . so i suspect that this version is notable because judy collins ' french is so beautiful . the final song in her songbook , `` my father , '' ( on the `` who knows where the time goes '' album ) is about `` my father always promised us that we would live in france , '' and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world . contemplating intense desire is inspiring , but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly . `` oh , mon amour , mon doux , mon tendre , mon verveilleux amour , ... '' `` hey , that 's no way to say goodbye '' is a beautiful song by leonard cohen , soft with sorrow but hey . .
the german political and social philosopher jurgen habermas is heir to the semantically rich tradition of frankfurt school thinkers . these men ( and sadly , they are mainly men , although hannah arendt is in some sense in this circle ) were seriously threatened by the collapse of the weimar republic . their decision to go into exile in the united states should probably be controversial . habermas is profoundly influenced by marx , weber , freud , and talcott parsons , and wrote this book in the context of uprisings against the viet nam war . what we are seeing right now , bush versus gore in a contested election in which the very structure of the united states government is being questioned , could be illuminated by careful study of this book . i commend it to the attention of anyone who would better understand a moment in united states history which has been descibed as a constitutional crisis
what a writer ! the development of the thomas covenant character into a legitimate hero , and redemption of linden avery was quite a story to experience ! absolutely unforgettable ! well done
for an artist that has helped shape the musical map since the <NUM> 's , and remained a sterling producer , and also has a album workrate to put most musicians to shame , it 's truly surprising that brian eno , has so many absolutely essential albums to his name . here we concentrate on the period where he created/produced a series of defining 'ambient ' albums in the mid-late <NUM> 's , that although not the first to produce ambient albums , mastered the form to such a degree , that some 20-30 years on , these albums are frequently referenced , when discussing the genre . although as much an electronic album as it is an ambient album , the mood here is one of detached sounds , restrained instruments and a slightly eerie , and atmospheric solitude . using a system of two reel-to-reel tape recorders , and making the ( relatively ) simple process of layering sounds on top of one another , eno was able to make stark simple sounds , from such instruments as ... keyboard , synth , organ , but layer them in such a way that although the music rarely changes direction , it 's beauty comes in the form of its simplicity . the first track ... the epic `` discreet music '' is really nothing more than a melancholic & slight sounding relaxation drone . but its what eno does with the sound and the use of spacial sound , that truly makes this impressive . brief compositions of synth are gradually brought in and out of the mix , and although most listeners wo n't realise it on the first listen , but the relation of these elements changes over time , albeit it very gradually , and coupled with the subtle use of noise and resonance , it reveals a sound of soothing 'ambience ' that washes over the listener . the `` three variations on the canon in d major '' is more consistent with the stylisation of 'classical ' music , with it less akin to 'ambient ' music , and more in keeping with the compositional elegance and arrangement of piano led orchestration . which has a rather melancholy and restless feel to it , and the tone of the strings/piano feels vastly different to the synth-led first track , and its arguably the more immediate track , due to its more noticeable increase in volume/tempo , and although a more rounded sound , still remains very delicate and gentle . in fact imagine these beautifully crafted tracks as works for soundtracks for films that were never filmed , as it 's deeply beguiling and littered with the romanticism that became a trademark in eno 's series of 'ambient ' albums . as it 's all so precisely performed and tremendously realised , that one ca n't help but fall in love with this incredible album . if you picked up any of eno 's other 'ambient ' albums , i really ca n't stress enough , how utterly recommended this album comes , it 's not only considered one of his finest 'ambient ' albums , but also just a truly exceptional album regardless of the genre . utterly essentia
a great look back at many interesting and important time periods of ringo and the beatles , happy times , turnoil , post beatles , pesonal up 's and down 's . obviously the <NUM> of them tried to keep contact during the post beatles years and ringo was nice enough to keep all the postcards and publish them for the fans to read
hellogoodbye has recently become one of my favorite new bands . they have a unique emo sound , with a touch of techno . the best tracks on their debut `` zombies ! aliens ! vampires ! dinosaurs ! `` , in my opinion are their first single `` here ( in your arms ) '' , `` baby , it 's fact '' , `` touchdown turnaround ( do n't give up on me ) `` , and `` all of your love '' . their lyrics are just plain catchy , and their songs vary throughout the album . some are loud , and some are soft love songs . out of all the songs on the album , i can totally see touchdown turnaround as their next single . it 's a great song , with really fun lyrics . if your a fan of bright eyes , you 'll like this band . for some reason , they remind me of them in some songs . it 's a fun cd that can be played over and over again .
beginning with her personal experiences and attraction to the world of the theater , swados bridges the gap of her own life with the common experiences of a group of youngsters as they create their own musical theater piece about the dangerous world they inhabit and the small redemptions of daily life as they accomplish their goals . specifically structured , the exercises begin with personal experiences and expand to include the group as a whole , each phase furthering the creative community : direction , voice , movement , characters , improvisation , discussion , time , space , music and choreography , the conclusion , their own show . this very accessible handbook is directed toward a specific audience , young people from twelve to the early twenties , ages mixed for maximum benefit from the experience . from middle and high school , young people can perform these exercises before their peers at public and private schools and local community centers , all directed toward channeling creative energy in a positive manner , the resulting performance a theatrical experience for the students involved . all of the categories outlined lend to the expansion of students ' awareness , but a teacher/reader can improvise as necessary to accommodate his group for a performance outside of school , inside school , as a training ground for young actors in a dramatic school or community environment , even as exercises for a limited class time . in the context of the theater , mentoring focuses on the sense of family created by mutual experience , a spirit of togetherness that may yield lifelong friendships and artistic collaborations . this hands-on guide to theatrical performance is practical and effective ; if followed , it will enrich the lives of students who participate in the process . practical and specific , at play is a valuable teaching tool ; even more , it is the diagram for success in a field that enhances students ' life experiences and collaborative endeavors with their peers , the result empowering . luan gaines/2006 .

satirical . sarcastic . ironic . humorous . salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life . this book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy 's life . the story starts off with a moody teenager , holden caulfield . he is expelled from his third school , pencey , and decides to hang around in new york city before heading back home . in new york , holden experiences the highs and lows of his life . one minute , he is in a very elated state and then the next minute , he is down in the dumps . as holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in nyc , he realizes what the true world holds in store for him . holden encounters run down hotels , clubs filled with losers , and plain old phoniness . but he also meets kind and generous people who , in a way , provide a light to holden and shows him that the world is n't all that bad . holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends . when he tries to run away from it all , he encounters even more problems with money shortage , unfriendly people , and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything . salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they can not live with at all . as holden tries to rediscover himself and his values , he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets
if you want to hear george szell and the cleveland orchestra at the peak of their famed mozartean sound , look no further than this disc . these works , both originally chamber pieces , are perfect showpieces for szell 's chamber-music style of mozart playing . these recordings capture szell and the orchestra at the prime of their partnership , combining the punchy , almost gutteral orchestral sound szell favored with transparent delineation of details and almost scary rhythmic and tonal precision . there are other , equally valid styles of playing these works , but none that are better . of course the german dances , with boskovsky and his ensemble at the helm , are well played and enjoyable too , but they 're the icing on a very substantial cake . do n't miss the opportunity to pick up this budget-priced piece of definitive mozart interpretation
it 's <NUM> ; the ussr has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the east coast of the united states for the purpose of ... brinksmanship ? but hold on , there is a problem ; the soviet union is staffed with incompetents ! ! ( one of communism 's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel ) . the menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go . it leaks , and it is cobbled together with substandard parts . after heading out to sea , there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits . the men receive lethal doses of radiation , but unfortunately the doctor does n't know anything about radiation sickness ... he is only giving them aspirin . before long radiation begins to permeate the ship . the entire crew is in danger . the officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the americans , while others want to save face for the soviet union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die . as the submarine becomes more and more disabled , as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking , as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby american destroyer , as the submarines 's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat , the dread of the crew is really palpable . this movie was very suspenseful because i had no idea how it would end . definitely worth your time
when michael nyman first published this work in the 70s , it was the only book of its kind to discuss some of the most cutting-edge stuff going around . most musical texts avoided discussing the fluxus group as & quot ; music , & quot ; but nyman integrates these radicals easily , and provided the first discussion of the scratch orchestra ( cardew et al ) , and related topics . the book still contains some of the clearest discussions of these topics around . it 's great to have it back in print , though too bad nyman could n't be bothered to provide updates on some of the folks discussed , like hugh skempton
once again , audra mcdonald proves that she 's the best musical theatre singer since streisand . while many fans might quibble with her selections ( mostly covers of rock and pop songs ) , her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none
this is a wonderful collection ..... normally in box sets you get a lot of fluff with a classic or two if your lucky .... well this set offers up pretty much nothing but classics . harvey is of course a legendary film and performance by stewart and the bonus features on this dvd being the introduction by stewart himself is wonderful . the two westerns are interesting because destry rides again is a very very early film for mr stewart and something of a minor classic while winchester '73 is a major movie which many feel brought back the western in the early <NUM> 's and also ignited a decade plus reign of mr stewart as a major star of westerns as well as working with this same director anthony mann on many occaisions . this version of winchester '73 .. while showing some age on the negative is pretty high quality but the bonus audio track which runs the feature length with mr stewart is priceless . so ... what 's left ? ony two of alfred hitchcocks greatet films ... vertigo and rear window ..... the remastered versions which look great and feature wonderful bonus materials on the makings of the films and restorations of them .... i do n't want to waste your time with plot lines etc ... for all <NUM> films .... but want to congratulate universal for giving us `` all killer , no filler '' on this james stewart `` collection '' .... a great value and a wonderful look at some of the most important work by this hollywood legend
this film is as slow as a day in your own childhood but with plenty to do and see in the nothing of it all . the vivid transparency from which the director coaxes all the many simple details is astonishing . this sort of cinema must be very hard to bring together as almost no one can really pull it off . the japanese director ozu was the master of it.and this is about as close as can get to a modern version of him . it 's really about the events of two brothers in childhood and i ca n't say enough good about it . i have seen it twice and i can only imagine it getting better with successive viewings . the only sort of awkward bit for me was when nature talked back in the guise of woodland hags etc .. but i never thought nature needed a human voice to speak for itself
i 've picked up all of badfinger 's album and this one is the best . my favorite tracks include got to get out of here , dennis , in the meantime , and meanwhile back at the ranch . the production is fantastic - big thanks to chris thomas - and the band is tight ! the guitar ending to meanwhile back is thrilling . the songwriting of the group throughout the album stands head and shoulders above any of the other albums . any potential hit singles to go along with day after day or no matter what ? no , but there 's not a weak song in the whole album . it flows perfectly , pulling you along with its sound , craftsmanship , and melody . what a crime it was for warner brothers to pull it after only <NUM> weeks ! a definite overlooked gem
let 's face it , what can i possibly say about robert rossen 's exquisitely hard-edged classic that has n't been said before ? `` the hustler '' is an astounding and uncompromising drama that seems as fresh today as it did <NUM> years ago . so often we 'll look back at the classics -- and , as is appropriate , they might seem dated . times change and that is reflected in cinema . `` the hustler , '' though , is one of the rare films that was so sophisticated , so intelligent , and so honestly raw -- that its power has not been diminished by the years . set in a very unglamorous world of pool halls and back rooms , `` the hustler '' is a testosterone fueled excursion into the life and pursuits of one of hollywood 's most notorious anti-heroes -- fast eddie felson . nominated for eight oscars , this refreshingly adult film cemented paul newman 's status as one of our greatest actors . the story of `` the hustler '' is surprisingly simplistic . a brash young pool shark sets his sights on defeating one of the game 's greatest players -- minnesota fats ( jackie gleason , at his best ) . but getting up on fats is n't enough -- no , he wants to crush his opponent . eddie 's naked and uncompromising drive eventually becomes his undoing as his winning streak turns to defeat . despondent and broke , eddie aligns with an equally desperate love interest . sarah , played by piper laurie ( never better ) , is a bitter alcoholic who has given up on life . but her complicated romance with eddie seems to hint at the possibility of new hope . eddie , however , ca n't change his spots overnight and an encounter with an unscrupulous manager ( george c. scott ) just might get eddie a second chance at fats . for good or for bad , it seems eddie is destined to go down that road again . paul newman imbues eddie with much cockiness , bravado , arrogance , ambition , and even desperation . in my opinion , it is newman 's best and most multi-layered performance . this ( along with `` hud '' ) celebrated newman as a new type of leading man -- someone you could like and despise at once . morally questionable , perhaps even amoral at times , newman was not afraid to be despicable . while only oscar nominated for this film , ironically he won roughly <NUM> years later for reprising eddie for `` the color of money . '' laurie , scott , and gleason all picked up oscar nods as well . the film is impeccably acted and beautifully filmed . not just for those with an interest in pool , `` the hustler '' is a searing drama that stands as a deft character study of a man figuring out what is important after all . while the collector 's edition seems to be handsomely packaged as a two disc set , whether or not it 's worth the upgrade from the special edition seems a bit suspect . both have widescreen presentation , commentary from newman and `` time '' film critic richard schickel ( among others ) , and features on `` how to make the shot '' and `` the hustler : the inside story . '' this new addition adds four featurettes -- '' life in the fast lane : fast eddie felson and the search for greatness , '' `` milestones in cinema history : the making of the hustler , '' `` swimming with sharks : the art of the hustle , '' and `` paul newman : hollywood 's cool hand . '' so it 's a judgment call whether or not you feel these extra shorts will add to your viewing experience . if you do n't own the film , then it 's a no-brainer ! either way , `` the hustler '' is a true classic . one of newman 's best ( if not best ) performances make this gritty and timeless drama a must own dvd . kgharris , 04/07
while i wish the disc clocked in longer than <NUM> minutes , it is crammed with fun songs that get you moving . the come ons do not have typical sound and i think anyone would enjoy this effort ! be sure to check out track <NUM> - i 'll show you why - my personal fave
if you have a king james version of the bible , the next time you read genesis , pay attention to how god is referred to . sometimes he 's called `` god '' and sometimes he 's called `` the lord '' . the reason for this is that the original hebrew text uses two different names for god , and the translators were careful to preserve this . when the hebrew text uses `` elohim '' it is translated as `` god '' . when the hebrew text uses `` yahweh '' , it is translated as `` the lord '' . if you carefully read genesis , you 'll notice that when genesis refers to god as `` yahweh '' , he seems to be very different than when he is refered to as `` elohim '' . for example , elohim is invisible -- he never appears to anybody nor can he be seen by anybody -- but yahweh talks face-to-face with people all the time : with abram , to jacob , and to moses and the <NUM> elders . elohim seems remote and regimented , whereas yahweh comes across as mischevious and irrascible . this has prompted some to propose the so-called `` documentary hypothesis '' which posits that genesis was formed by editing together two or more different books , each book using a different word for god and each book presenting a different picture of who god was and what he was all about . the book of j is the hypothasized book which used 'yahweh '' as the name of god . scholars try to reconstruct this book by bringing together all of the passages in the first <NUM> books of the bible which refer to god as `` yahweh '' . the result is startling : the same stories you 've heard all your life ( the tower of babal , joseph going to egypt , abram bargaining with god over sodom and gomorrah ) , when read together like this , take on a whole different level of meaning . this book provides two things in one handy volume : it provides a reconstruction of the book of j , freshly translated by david rosenberg , and it also provides an extended commentary by harold bloom , who is certainly the best reader alive today , and who is uniquely qualified to serve as a tour guide through the experience of reading j . so to review the book i 'd like to review each of these seperately . first , rosenberg 's translation . to illustrate just how good it is at bringing things out of the text which you ordinarly would n't notice , i 'd like to quote from his translation of the story of the tower of babal : `` we can bring ourselves together '' they said `` like stone on stone , use brick for stone : bake it until hard . '' for morter they heated bitumen . notice how this translation brings out the parallelism between the tower of babal and human society : the tower is made out mud bricks bound by bitumen , and society is made out of people bound by language . but people are also just made out of mud -- recall the creation story where yahweh breathes the breath of life into mud . baking the mud into bricks is symbolic of the people making themselves hard , and using bitumen for morter is symbolic of them using language and government to organize themselves . rosenberg 's translation makes available to us many of the puns and wordplay which other english translations unfortunately lose . now , to review bloom 's commentary . scholarly types are fond of dising bloom for his tendency to be speculative , to use his imagination to illuminate the reading of the text . but what they are forgetting is that j is a bunch of stories , written for us to experience ! to use an parable of rorty 's , its like a surgion describing your wife as a bunch of tissues and organs vs. describing your wife as warm and loving , important person in your life . yes , `` warm and loving '' ar n't medical terms , but that does n't make them a bad description of your wife . also , the very greatest literature , such as j is , will admit of more than one reading , more than one interpretation , more than one point of view . bloom here does us excellent service by showing us his point of view on the text , telling us how the experience of reading the text impacts him . the author of j did n't write j just to chronicle some historical figures -- the author of j wrote j so that we could read it , and by reading it , become changed into new people . _this_ is the aspect of experiiencing j which bloom 's commentary helps along , and this is the aspect which critics of bloom 's commentary are missing the most
the scold 's bridle , in my opinion , is one of minette walters ' best mysteries -- at least one of her best i 've read so far ! her characters are well-developed , and the reader does n't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be -- no one liked mathilda , it seemed . throughout the police investigation , readers are faced with learning of mathilda gillispie 's abusive and haunting background of secrets , lies , and deception . mathilda 's character , though dead as the story begins , is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters . having left all of her money to an unlikely person , her doctor susan blakeney , mathilda 's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit mathilda 's wealth . readers find that mathilda 's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as mathilda had . this part of the story , no doubt , leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations . walters does n't let on who the murderer is , and i 'll admit , i was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction . overall , i enjoyed this novel moreso than the ice house or the sculptress , but they are all very good books , and i would wholeheartedly recommend walters to readers wanting a good mystery
i got this cd almost exactly a year after hearing & quot ; not pretty enough & quot ; on a sampler cd i got from purchasing a present for someone . i immediatly fell in love with the song , mainly because it put my feelings into words about someone . after listening to the one song for a year , my boyfriend finally got me barricades and brickwalls for christmas . it 's awesome , and i 'm listening to it now ! her voice is amazing , with a touch of breathiness that adds to the overall effect . the lyrics are another thing , so thoughtfully written out and sung from her own heart . she actually wrote the songs herself . i 've never been a country fan , but the cd is making me change my view ( very slowly ! ) . i love this girl
`` intimacy '' is sexually explicit and raw , as one would almost expect from a european `` art-house '' movie . the sex scenes are n't really the focal point of the movie -- it merely establishes the setting for our protagonists , jay and claire . the story becomes quite intriguing as jay decides that he wants more than just anonymous weekly romp with claire . acting by timothy spall is excellent as usual . he is awesome in serious roles
'the mamas and the papas ' had a sound all their own , a unique kind of southern california blend , a harmony of at times melancholy beauty . they had one great singer , mama cass , whose 'dream a little dream of me ' is perhaps the closest thing they ever produced to a really great 'solo ' . their signature song and one of the unforgettable sixties song is 'california dreaming ' . it seemed to express a certain haunting longing , the longing for a place which then represented to many americans , california , the golden land of escape and new home . john phillips who like mama cass is no longer with us was the arranger , director who really made the 'mamas and papas ' into such a great group . it is strange even then their sound evoked a certain feeling of 'nostalgia ' but four decades later the jump of initial joy hearing them brings is truly complemented by the sense of a world long gone .
this is a good book if you have n't read any of the other books about feynman . a few of the chapters have been published elsewhere , such as in `` the pleasure of finding things out '' which in my opinion was a better ( more science-centric ) book . this book was more about his personal life and included some interesting information about his experiences with women and his time spent travelling
great book , definitely one of my favorite king novels . a lot more brutal and a lot better then the movie ( which was great ) . the only thing i did n't like were the exerts from `` misery 's return '' , i hate romance novels even if they are written by stephen king so i skipped over most of them . but the rest of the book was amazing and even though i 'd seen the movie and pretty much knew what was going to happen it still had me in suspense and hooked through the whole thing , i did n't want to put it down and finished it in <NUM> days ( which is fast for me ) . so if you 've never read a king book before this would be a good place to start
this is one of those great and rare movies from the <NUM> 's that you can not find in any video stores . i know there is some person out there saying `` well who wants to rent it '' to often to many times we get caught up in our own generation with our own music , movies and all the new things that technology has put out there to even give a movie a chance from a different era . i collect alot of movies and have tried to collect ones i watched when i was growing up such as tourist trap , curtains. , and the little girl who lives down the lane . today there are a lot of movies being remade like the amityville horror and the texas chainsaw massacre please do yourself a favor and watch these movies that were first made and copied so poorly also give the actors from the original movies a chance such as james brolin , marilyn burns and gunnar hansen as leatherface these are true and serious actors they really had to act , todays stars are usually standing in front of a green screen . i have to admit i do own some of the remakes but there will always only be the originals first . thanks yvonne and steiger you rule
i originally got this book when i first moved out on my own . i had some cooking experience which i gleaned from my mother , but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience . this book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook , and taught me most of the basics . years later , i 'm a much better cook , and though i rarely use this book 's recipes at face value , i often reference it for a guideline to dishes that i enjoy , while adding my own touches . also , when i 'm preparing to try something new , this is generally the first book i go to , even after all this time . other cook books have come and gone , but this one has staying power for me , earning it its five stars . a great purchase for a young adult , or even an every-day cook who just is n't very good , or who has a limited array of recipes . it is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from
saving private ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes , drama and action . during the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of wwii fought at omaha beach . not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood . tom hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as : edward burns , tom seizmore , etc . their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission : saving one man . the storyline is simple , captain john miller ( tom hanks ) has been assigned a mission from the general george c. marshall . the mission 's objective : finding private james francis ryan from iowa , whose <NUM> other brothers have been k.i.a . ( killed in action ) . conflict : private ryan is somewhere in normandy . where ? no one exactly knows . like captain miller says : `` it 's like finding a needle in a stack of needles . '' yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way . losing men as they go , many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others . it comes to a culminating end , one that might leave you with a tear or two . if you love war movies , drama , or like the period itself , i highly recommend you go out and watch this movie .
anyone who has worked in the area where psychology and religion interface will appreciate this solid , thorough and carefully edited work that is without par in the field . grounded in the actual experience of the `` theology of living documents '' , the articles are as much practical as theoretical and adcademic . thoroughly ecumenical , this massive reference work promotes dialogue between faith and theology and clinical theory and practice . if this is the kind of subject that interests you then you need to own this book . f.x . charet phd
i really liked this anime . a lot . especially the music . it 's so ... haunting . so of course i had to get my hands on the entire soundtrack . go get `` key to twilight '' . sometimes i just watched the thing to get the music . that 's not to downplay the goodness of the anime mind you . it was good . the only thing that made me sad was the open ending of the anime . you have to play the vid game for the entire storyline . and that sucks because as my husband says `` i have no game power . '' i had so many game overs i lost my passion for the game . i still do n't know how it ends . -sigh
many fans of the orignal chainsaw massacre would have me hanged for saying this , but the beginning is my favorite of the entire lot . it 's a great prequel ! the movie is completely brutal and disgusting and even funny in some twisted ways . leatherface looks totally awesome and the family is even crazier than ever . if you liked the tcm remake a few years ago , you 'll love this new one .
this is a very good tv show you have to hava it
the previous reviewer 's reference to this song having the sound of giorgio moroder is right on the money . i loved moroder 's work in the <NUM> 's and that 's what attracted me to this song . the rest of the album though is boring . this song makes up for that . bring on the video ! ! !
this homage to alfred hitchcock is a work of genius . the shower scene in this movie remains one of the best parodies ever . madeline kahn 's role is one of her best and cloris leachman looks as if she enjoyed playing her character . the casting in this movie is inspired .
instead of giving an individual review of each volume in this series , i decided to give one review on the final volume of the series . as a child in the 70s i grew up hearing these songs on the radio and the entire series really gave me a feeling of nostalgia . when i started collecting this series , i did n't always know each artist or even each song title , but once i spun the disc , the lyrics to these songs came back from the dark void of my memory . that was half the fun of this whole series . volume <NUM> was the one volume in the entire series that i remebered each song . volumes <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> and <NUM> are my favorite volumes . not each volume is a winner . volumes <NUM> , and <NUM> i felt were n't that great of volumes , but each volume contains at least 4-5 great gems . again , the entire series is great . this series and rhino 's did n't it blow your mind series are hands down the best series of <NUM> 's music out there . i give both series five stars . if there was one thing that i felt that rhino missed on these was that they did n't take each series out to five more volumes . the would have given have a nice day <NUM> volumes and did n't it blow your mind <NUM> volumes . either way , the have a nice day series is my favorite 70s music complilation series and it has gotten lots of use in my cd player . if you like quirky am pop from the 70s , then this series is for you . you wo n't regret it . if your looking for more of the fm style 70s music , then get time/lifes sound of the 70s . after reading several reviews for the various volumes in this series , it 's clear the some people missed the entire point of this series . this entire series was supposed to resemble or be a throw back to those infamous compilation lps from k-tel that were everywhere in the 70s . this series was n't supposed to have great songs . just memorable ones .
i can vividly remember when this type of music was `` new '' now it 's just very collectable . of the steamroller set i loved number <NUM> and this one . help us and save us i had the record albums . granted , the cover pctures were more enjoyable back then . aside from sentiment it is still lively music . buy one now
christopher walken is a former organized crime figure that gets kidnapped by a group of preppies that hold him for ransom . ( this happens right up front in the story so i 'm not giving anything away ) . the kidnappers realistically come off as bungling amateurs . walken 's presence is overwhelming ( even duct taped to a chair ) and he looms large over the whole story . great perfomance . throughout the film , the viewer keeps anticipating , `` somebody is going to really get hurt here '' . they do , of course . the story has plenty of mystery and multiple twists . there are gruesome execution and mutilation scenes . it has laugh out loud comedy - special mention to denis leary and his `` stingray boots '' . he plays a thug and is appropriately menacing and crude , but he is genuinely funny . . . even while brutally beating a man with a golf club . the r rating is appropriate . a well written and directed film . camera work a little unimaginative . good sound . if you are ok with the violence , you are guaranteed an entertaining experience with this film .

the series of `` golden age of american rock & roll '' released by ace could n't have a better end . during the past <NUM> years they have delighted us with a series of <NUM> cd 's with <NUM> songs each remembering the rock & roll era mostly with minor top hits between <NUM> and <NUM> . one reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was . now besides these series of <NUM> cd 's from the r & r era they have launched another <NUM> special editions with the same title : one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition . both deserve more than <NUM> stars . the song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight ! most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these were n't available after the time they were top hits . i never found them back on what compilation so ever until ace put them all together <NUM> years later . and with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm . therefore do n't hesitate . buy it together with the country edition and you will have <NUM> songs for utmost pleasure ; <NUM> songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them .

beginners & beyond is a wonderful place to start a yoga practice . it 's doable yet can be challenging , lots of great instruction , you can do the sets separately when you 're short on time or both together for a longer sessions , and it 's just plain fun ! even if you are no longer a beginner , like me , i think you will enjoy this . kundalini yoga for beginners & beyond is one of my favorite , most-used ana brett & ravi singh dvd 's
i loved the movie , so i bought the cd to go with it . this is the best version of chicago ever . everyone can really sing and sing well . i love catherine zeta-jones ! she 's fantastic ! renee did well too , i was surprised by talent . richard gere too amazed me with his talent . john c. reilly is absolutely amazing doing mister cellophane . queen latifah was great as well . if you 're not sure which chicago soundtrack to buy , i would suggest this one over the broadway ones , unless you want all the songs . they cut a few songs out of the movie , but it was no major loss . this is a great soundtrack and highly recommend it to anyone !
i have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the best book for interviews . the information i have learned from this book applies to almost any interview not just the police one . i found that i had already begun categorizing people so i knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business . i am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview . i feel extremely prepared for the interview thanks to this book
the only problem that i have with & quot ; specialist in all styles & quot ; is due to my own ignorance . that is , i do n't speak any other languages . therefore , the lyrics could be mocking me for purchasing the album , and i would know any better . but i do n't think that they are mocking me . i say that because the music contained throughout the album is just great . these ensemble from senegal is a group of clearly talented musicians . the latin-themed music combined with african beats is a pleasing combo that i find very easy to listen to . again since none of the music is in english none of tracks in particular stand out to me , but do n't let that stop you from picking this little gem out . it is an instant classic for any beginners world music collection , and will provide instant street cred for all aspiring music buffs
home & away : norrisman has been around for quite a while , basically since the mid-nineties - enough time to put out a couple of albums as well as several bucketloads of singles - but never really made waves away from jamaican shores until last year 's appropriately titled home & away . ray stephens ' easy listening flames rhythm provided the backdrop for this passionate , pleading love song ( as well as richie spice 's super earth alert , and morgan heritage 's lush in a ghetto ) , which met with respectable international success , and now heads up this latest long player from the uk 's greensleeves label . greensleeves are obviously giving the artist a well-deserved push here , with glossy packaging and great liner photos featuring norrisman trodding the train yards with a guitar strapped across his back like a jamaican woody guthrie , or something . it 's a classy package for sure , and without a doubt , it 's a classy record too . the familiar title track leads off , and is matched and even bettered by great cuts like seh dem bad , i 'm a free man , the ganja lover 's herbs to your nerve , and the bubbling armageddon on . the reliable lutan fyah ( another recent greensleeves mover with his excellent phantom war album ) shows up for the decent combination tune , after all , but other than that , it 's all norrisman all the way , and to his credit , he carries it off without so much as a misstep . most of the production credit goes to byron murray and his in the streetz outfit , and the backup is bright and lively throughout , with a very tangible - and very welcome - old school one-drop vibe . the only real detour is the delly ranks-produced move hard on the red bull & guinness rhythm , which just shows that norrisman is as comfortable up at the edge of the bump as he is with the roots and lovers material . home & away is a very strong release , and along with phantom war , one of the best rootswise long players of the year so far . next up on the roots release schedule is mr . perfect 's debut , giddimani . look out for this one - it could be another contender !
this amazingly beautiful album to me is the soundtrack of anatolia , of an era gone by when turks , greeks , armenians and other ethnic groups shared their lives peacefully and harmoniously . its sadness inevitably reminds me of millions who unnecessarily died on this soil in many wars fought in early twentieth century , of people forced to leave the only land the knew for unknown destinations and destinies , of the unimaginable hardships endured by its people . and more personally it takes me fom new york and puts me right next to my father 's grave in a forgotten anatolian village , <NUM> miles away
i love this book . i received it and refer to it often . i tell all my friends , especially those who show interest in wanting to change their lives . its probably the last `` self-help '' book on the subject i will ever buy and i have bought many `` manifestation '' , create-what-you-desire type of books . its simply amazing . thaaaaaaank you
i have the lp of this album and it is almost worn thru ! i decided that if it was available on cd i would get it as a birthday present to myself ! i found this to be one of the best purchases i have made lately . the remastering of the original songs is perfect and the bonus tracks are great ! joan 's voice is still clear and sweet and very easy to listen to . her voice got a more raspy sound on later albums . the bonus tracks were the icing on the cake for me . she covers a wide range of folk songs , from guthrie 's `` ranger 's comand '' to `` rock salt and nails '' by bruce 'utah ' phillips . it is interesting to note that the people who made the labels for the album did not know that there is a substance known as rock salt that is often used in shotguns as a 'varment load ' and therefore list it as `` rock , salt and nails ! '' no matter what you call it i found it to be one of the most haunting songs i have ever heard . all in all , if you like joan baez and/or folk music this is a must have . her version of `` one too many mornings '' brings back vivid memories of the '60s
it was in august of <NUM> that 15-year-old emmett till was sent from chicago by his mother to spend the summer with his great uncle , moses wright , in money , mississippi . on august <NUM> , till and some other black teenagers who had been picking cotton went to bryant 's grocery and meat market to get some candy . in the store till allegedly whistled at carolyn bryant . when her husband returned from a trip several days later and heard about the incident , bryant and his half-brother j. w. milam decided to `` teach the boy a lesson . '' on august <NUM> , they kidnapped till from his uncle 's house , too him to a plantation shed , brutalized the boy , shot him , and dumped his body in the tallahatchie river , having tied a seventy pound fan from a cotton gin around till 's neck with barbed wire . the two men were tried and found not guilty by an all-white jury . in january <NUM> their confession was paid for and published by `` look '' magazine . both men would die from cancer , milam in <NUM> and bryant in <NUM> . i do not remember when i first heard of emmett till , but the story of the black teenager who was killed by white men in mississippi for the crime of whistling at a white woman was a pivotal event in energizing the civil rights movement and i have known about it for a long time . however , i never saw a photograph of emmett till 's body until i was at the seattle art museum looking at an exhibit having to deal with depictions of race and gender in art , and there was a small photograph of till 's body on display at his funeral . the photograph was too small to tell any details , but you were struck by the swollen and misshaped head . it did not look human , but then to milam and bryant , emmett till was never a human being . the title of keith a. beauchamp 's documentary is `` the untold story of emmett louis till , '' not because the story has not been told , but because the people he interviewed , including till 's mother , mamie carthan mobley , along with several cousins and friends from that summer in mississippi , never had a chance to tell their story in court . beauchamp provides them with that opportunity , using newsreel footage from <NUM> as well . it follows the chronology of events , from till 's birth to the present and beauchamp 's own investigations into the case ( his chief claim is that up to <NUM> other people were involved in the crime in various ways ) . for just telling the story and covering the facts , beauchamp keeps things pretty basic in his documentary , letting people speak for themselves . the most unforgettable part of the documentary is when mobley tells the story of getting her son 's body back home . officials in mississippi wanted to bury the body before anybody got a good look at it and when mobley managed to get it back to chicago the coffin was nailed shut . but she got it opened and then describes what it was she saw in simple and graphic details , emphasizing not the horrors but the child she remembered ( e.g. , she smiles as she talks about how she thought emmett 's teeth were the most beautiful things she had ever seen and then remembering seeing only two of them and wondering where the rest of them were ) . it is only after beauchamp lets her tell of the pivotal point where she decides to leave the casket open at the funeral so the world can see what was done to her son in mississippi that we go from a school photograph of a smiling emmett till to the wrecked ruin of his face and head . this is the most disturbing image from the civil rights movement , but that is exactly why it is the most important one and why its publication in `` jet '' was an important catalyst . you really can not tell the story unless you look at the photograph , and teachers who want to show this documentary to their students should be prepared to defend their decision . in addition to mobley , it is moses wright , who stood up in court and pointed to the two white men who came and took away till ( there is a photograph of the dramatic moment ) , who stands out here . but it strikes me that somebody who is not mentioned by name , william bradford huie , played a key role as well . a journalist and author ( `` the americanization of emily , '' `` the klansman '' ) , huie was often criticized by mainstream journalists for using his checkbook to get stories . but it was huie who paid the murderers to confess in a national publication five months later . a follow up story revealed that the businesses of milam and bryant had gone under because they were ostracized by local whites . i am sure this did not happen because of the murders , which clearly the jury representing the town supported , but because of the published confession that took away the thin veneer provided by the not guilty verdict . this documentary received a lot of publicity because it fueled an effort to reopen the case . the u.s. department of justice did reopen the case to determine whether others in addition to milam and bryant were involved . the f.b.i . and mississippi officials worked on a joint investigation , and while till 's body was exhumed so an official autopsy could be performed , the federal investigation was closed in march of this year . consequently , justice in this case will not result in anybody ending up in jail , but rather with preserving the testimony of these witnesses for posterity ( till 's mother died after the documentary was completed ) . carolyn bryant ( now donham after her fourth husband ) is still alive and living in greenville mississippi . signs in her front yard warn that uninvited visitors will be prosecuted , an apparent indication that she believes the law in mississippi continues to protect her a lot more than it ever did emmett till .
this very complete volume is a lovely gift book as well as a useful reference book . the only weakness is the lack of emphasis on arm positions when doing the steps although they are illustrated in the photographs . i believe dancers who have experienced the following will find it useful too : when i was a student of ballet , i was frustrated by the subtle differences in the standards of different teachers . sometimes i wondered , & quot ; so how exactly am i supposed to do this ? & quot ; i did not enjoy being corrected for what a prior instructor had taught me and pronounced well-executed . this book would have clarified things for me at the time . now that i practice alone , i find this book invaluable . also , i support christine 's review dated may <NUM> , <NUM>
i have read several of barbara michaels ' books and have to say that this may actually be the best one i have read ! i borrowed it from the library and was so entranced by the story that i read it in one day . now i plan to purchase a copy from amazon for a place on my bookshelf - which is n't that easy to qualify for ! only the very best books gain a place there . and this book is a great one
i have always had a fascination about porfirio rubirosa and this book makes me realize that he really was the latin james bond and an inspiration for the subsequent books and movies . the book contains truely interesting no where else to be found facts and is written in such an easy to read way . i think that anybody that has ever enjoyed a james bond movie or book should read this book . i am sure that one day this book will be turned into a move
i first need to say , if it were n't for the dvd and all of its features , anywhere but home would have gotten three stars . i say this because , evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio . the cd : this contains the audio to the rock band 's performance live in paris . it also has the album 's most beautiful and stand out track : `` missing '' . the concert : the overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line . amy lee also has her share of troubles for this performance . she can sing her high loud notes pretty well , but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones . late into the performance , amy 's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her . she does however , know how to work the crowd . the bands newer tracks are well performed , and the covers they perform sound better than their own work . this is good and bad ; it shows that evanescence can play pretty well , but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live . the best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful amy lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band 's songs . awesome performances include : `` thoughtless '' `` breathe no more '' `` farther away '' `` bring me to life '' `` whisper '' dvd features : this disc is awesome because it has so many features . it of course has evanescence 's performance in paris . it also has music videos for `` going under '' , `` bring me to life '' , `` everybody 's fool '' , and `` my immortal '' . there is also a hidden video icon of evanescence 's band symbol . when this is activated , another live performance of `` bring me to life '' is played . the disc also has tons of rehearsal , bloopers , and on the road footage ; including evanescence 's tour with seether . the credits also have the audio to evanescence 's newest track `` missing '' . anywhere but home is an interesting concert and a fun look into evanescence 's life , i recomend viewing it
nice edition of this work . has good footnotes , and contains much besides the poem itself , including information on milton 's life , and a section on sources that milton used , and `` classic '' and modern criticism of the work .
one of the best novels i have ever read . this book has everything a good read should : characters that become real to the reader , a wonderful sense of place , a sense of history and knowledge . not only do you get completely wrapped up in the world of vine sullivan , but you also learn more about yourself in the process . a truly beautiful book that i ca n't recommend highly enough . i 've bought a copy for everyone i love
yeah , ok , the drummer is way off , his timing sucks and he looks alternatively sick , angry or distracted . maybe he was sick that day . but we have to remember that it is a live performance with all the screw-ups that come with it . betts is still a master guitarist and band leader . my only question is why is the sound on the cd so much fuller and better than on the dvd ? they were recorded at the same show ! i have to also highly recommend the <NUM> cd instant live set , recorded with this same band
another `` must buy '' box set along with numerous other american tv shows ( a list too long to mention ) . i live in the uk and the tv stations here seem reluctant to show classic tv even with the advent of satellite/cable . i used to be very envious of american viewers who had access to tv land , however i now see that they no longer show classic shows from the <NUM> 's preferring to now stick to shows from the <NUM> 's onwards . i purchased season <NUM> when it was released and laughed from start to finish , even my wife who never saw the original limited run of the show enjoys watching it and laughs just as much as myself . i ca n't remember much about season <NUM> although i will when i watch the dvd , one thing i do remember is that it was very funny and would recommend anyone to purchase it
i am very happy with my purchase . for over <NUM> years i have been wondering how this series ended . i never saw the entire series just a few episodes . it is a good show and i would recommend it
recently , my wife and i went on holiday to the bordeaux region to tour the vineyards . this book was extremely helpful in planning and executing the trip . as geography and 'terroir ' are key to understanding wine , i know of no other book that gives a better overview of this mysterious and elegant beverage . it 's a must buy for wine lovers
what would have happened if ian curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life ? it is a hard question to ask since i am a very devoted joy division fan but i also am a good fan of new order . i have to say that i imagine joy division might have recorded one ore two more albums and broken up : new order may have never been . so while it is tragic that curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of joy division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as new order . the band is very different from jd but in `` power , corruption lies '' , new order 's first , we hear a hint of jd with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period . the music on this album is more heavily synth and drum based than any of the jd material though maybe not as much as later new order work . by <NUM> synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the midi interface for synths etc . it was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified . all history aside , the album is great : it is upbeat , full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic . if you are buying the album just for `` blue monday '' ( a track so good even a horrible band like orgy could make a hit out of it ) you are in for a real surprise . you will find many of the other tracks to be great as well . `` age of consent '' is among my other favorites . this is another great track for dancing . also `` the village '' is a great track as well . if you are going to buy two new order albums get this one and substance . although they share a few tracks they are both great . i find that this album get far more play though . this is a must have for the new order fan of course . but also fans of new wave/'80 's music and joy division fans alike should also buy this one . this album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan . i highly recommend it ! -- ted murena
i dont know what some of these people are talking about up here dissing mr bobby v 's cd 's .. this cd is nothing but the truth for this to be his first solo project and to only have one guest apperance he held this cd down very well and i give him all the props in the world his and a few other r & b cds are the only ones that i can actually listen to from start to finish without wanting to skip any tracks .. and as far as the girl buying this cd over her book for school your a dummy for that one you need to get your priorities str8 then .... you should have been worried about your darn education more so than a darn cd .. you may have hated this cd .. but bobby has already made it .. have you
who knows how different the history of music as we know it would be like without this genius . every blues musician since and many classic rock bands owe him a huge debt . this is a must for any music collection
watch out , this book is addictive . my <NUM> month old daughter insists that we read it when ever she sees the book . the book provides a fun take off on the traditional song . the illustrations are also amusing . just be ready to sing the song over and over and ...
standout tracks : its funky enough , mind blowin , lend me an ear , let the bass go , beautiful but deadly , the doc & the doctor , no one can do it better , whirlwind pyramid , the formula , portrait of a masterpiece , the grand finale ( west coast version of the symphony ) . filler : the commercial skits are pointless are obviously put on to take up space . bottom line : doc was proof ( in the 80s ) that the west coast had emcees that can spit with the best of them . doc had a killer flow and a freestyle that can only be described as crazy ! the production by dr. dre and yella is superb at best . its unfortunate that he got into an accident and lost his voice and is now reduced to ghostwriting raps for dr. dre and snoop ( what you think i dont know ? ) . he could have been as big as jay-z was in the game without the commercial appeal that jay-z has . this cd is definetely worth being in your collection
cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century ; like borges and nabokov i return to his short stories often ( more than a decade after first discovering them ) , and can still get new things out of them . i agree with previous reviewers - cortazar 's precision with language rivals nabokov , kafka , proust or borges . i would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different , the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of ferlinghetti - cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion , and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this ( and other ) collections . this is a great introduction to cortazar , with many personal favorites : `` night face up , '' `` idol of the cyclades , '' `` house taken over '' and `` axolotl '' are all unforgettable short fictions . i would n't stop there - cortazar 's other writing is well worth investigating ( especially the second story collection , all fires the fire ) . cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late , with a number of key works currently out of print . thankfully , and for the time being , this is not one of them . -david alsto
i have had a few ballroom dance classes and this series is a very good supplement to them . series <NUM> handles the very beginning steps and does not go very far , but it is an excellent starter series . the instructors are very easy to watch and follow
this book shows what the great lineup of broadway shows was for 2001-2002 and it not only lists it barely , it goes into depth on huge hits like mamma mia ! and thoroughly modern millie . its really great
this is one of those books which needs a little introduction : in australia , the kelly gang is famous the way that dillinger or bonnie and clyde are in the us . this book shows peter carey trying ( with much success ) to recreate the rugged conditions of australian life , and it is very well-written in a kind of rough-backcountry slang . it shows how incredibly talented peter carey is , and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter
i 'm new to crime analysis but what i have read and been able to put to use , the information in this book is great . it does n't go into depth but covers the many areas of crime analysis and gives a good bibliography . for beginners like me this is a great book
i 'm a recording engineer by trade . i sit in little rooms with no windows and big speakers listening to the same song for <NUM> hour stretches for weeks in a row . every now and again a record will roll through that is actually fun to make . this sounds like one of those recordings . whether or not the players took this seriously or not will only be known to them and the production team , but the presentation comes across as if it was just a bunch of talented friends hanging around a studio and having some fun making music . with a great cover version of one of my absolute favorite hank songs , the album might have been able to leave one or two songs in the can ... but rip the album to an ipod and those songs can be the right breath of fresh air as you 're driving . the audio quality and production decisions of the recording should also be noted . yeah , there are some notes of questionable tuning but the their presentation is so believable the record would not have been served if those notes had been corrected . matt marinelli captured the sounds with perfection , and did n't over process or manipulate it later [ or so it seems ! ! ] . the record works for me in a big way and i for one am exceptionally happy to own a copy of this recording [ a client for whom i 'm going to start a project in a few months sent me the copy as a kind of template for the way he 'd like his project to come out ... if we get 1/2 way there then that is going to be one damn fun project ! ! ]
saw this group twice on this album tour . excellent . wore the album out . have the cd , a must have for true southern rockers
i watched this film when it was originally released theatrically . i remember that the response from the audience was much the same as the response i remember when i saw robocop ( had to sneak in ) in the theater : a few people clapped enthusiastically and the rest looked around at each other as if to wonder `` is it o.k . to have enjoyed this ? .... '' i , myself just enjoyed the well assembled action and the perfectly timed humor . a few years later i joined the army and a few years after that ... well you know what happened .... i have to say that i appreciate the satirical component of the film much more than i did at the time . at this point most people can appreciate that war is hell ( that cliché ' is for real , <NUM> % unadulterated , bone fide , certified , and not-likely-to-change-in-the-near-future , fact ) . even if one begins righteously , that is with a proper justification , the physical realities of what happens on the battle field are no less horrific . there are tools on the battle field that are there strictly to turn your average teeny-bopper into softball sized chunks of red stuff ( i mean that literally ) . verhoeven understands this and does an excellent job of contrasting that reality with the type of fantasy rationalization that is required to ( at least successfully ) prosecute large scale violence . for me the most poignant moment in the film is when then main characters confront the bugs for the first time and witness a fellow soldier being ripped to shreds . the female trooper who `` joined to have babies ... '' makes an absolutely blood curdling shriek and then turns to run . the look on the actress 's face and the sound of her voice , completely captures the feeling one gets when one is being fired at in anger . whether one admits it or not . i highly recommend this film . i think it should be required viewing .
i thought this was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book
i 'm very happy to have see this great band for the first time at the pearl jam concert in italy , it 's a very great band that make a great dvd concert , excellent atmophere and sound in this dvd !
read this to understand sting 's `` tea in the sahara '' reference for the first time , and to your very core . ( we 're all looking for the tallest sand dune -- the place with the optimal vantage point -- and we often lose our way in deserts of our own making . ) what an amazing book . i 'm so glad i believed gore vidal 's cover blurb about bowles ' art far exceeding that of other contemporary american writers . really , vidal says it best : `` bowles has glimpsed what lies back of our sheltering sky ... an endless flux of stars so like those atoms which make us up that we experience not only horror but likeness . '' beg , borrow , or buy at least a cheap paperback version : if you do n't read the sheltering sky , you 're missing out on greatness
& quot ; what 's in a name & quot ; is a perfect taste of rodney 's early years in the nightclub scene . you can even hear glasses hitting glasses and other various club noises in the background . he 's a little toned down , but you still get tons of his trademark & quot ; i do n't get no respect & quot ; jokes . if you want to hear some of rodney 's greatest jokes before they were really famous and you do n't want to spend a lot of money , this is the cd for you . i 'm really happy my friend , kevin mccarthy bought it for me
the stills are a montreal indie rock band who write expertly woven melodies crafted in the familiar niche of swirly-80s-post-punksters like echo & the bunnymen or the church , but add a unique neo-vibe which finds them comfortable next to say , interpol or bloc party . this is their best release by far , every song heart-wrenchingly wrought forward with layered guitars and superb lyrics . if you like a comfortable mix of brit pop influence , a dash of romanticism and depression , finely crafted into guitar heavy pulsating riffs , then this is for you ! fans of the walkmen rejoice -- this is the better purchase of the two~this lp is packed full of college radio singles , including `` gender bombs '' and `` changes are no good .
doug montgomery got excellent statistical training at vpi . he also has a wealth of practical experience from his consulting work . his books on regression , statistical design and response surfaces are all well written and understandable to engineers . this 4th edition published in <NUM> still contains all the useful information on factorial and fractional factorial designs . chapter <NUM> is a wonderful up-to-date chapter that covers important process optimization topics not often covered in traditional design of experiments books . this includes response surface methods , mixture experiments , evolutionary operation and taguchi methods . it does not require high level mathematics
i really enjoyed this book ! ! ! it was very interesting to know that your lost loved ones are in fact still here and watching over us and it is also interesting to know how they trancended to the other side . i esspecially enjoyed the part about the celebs and how sylvia browne actually talked to them
in the <NUM> 's you had nantucket , the <NUM> 's had pkm & the <NUM> 's had cry of love . all share a page in nc 's rock and roll history and pee wee watson played part in all . this is the rock and roll tree of north carolina . i loved them all and want to thank them for the memories . i recommend all their albums to any . you can still get nantucket 's albums and this one from cry of love , but unfortunately you ca n't find pkm 's `` rock erotica '' . maybe one day ! i want to thank kenny soule , pee wee watson , michael gardner , audley freed & robert kearns for some great memories . daryl boyette ( formerly of wkns & wsfl radio
i love pop-up books and this one left me hungry for something sweet -- -like a cookie . wonderful pop-ups . great premis . my great grand children loved this boo
sometimes you just want to be transported to a different musical universe , to a time when everything was possible.from the outrageous clothes of alphonse on the cover ( why are we so boring these days ? ) to the fantastic tight energetic playing of everyone involved , this is a cd that holds up remarkably well.the sound quality on my cd is amazing , and if you think jazz fusion means unstructured noodling then you could n't be further from the truth with this disc.the songs are focused and precise with accessible melodies and inspired solos.there is a real sort of joy that emanates from this music thats very refreshing in our crazy 21st century world
great musicianship and well throughtout lirycs . it 's brilliant , original , melodic , fast and vicious . weel done melodies , incredible solos . ca n't go wrong with this one !
this disc contains three works by russian-tatar composer sofia gubaidulina , an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles : `` in croce '' , `` silenzio '' , and `` sieben worte '' . the common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan . the latter is a type of russian accordian played here by elsbeth moser , who performed in the western premier of `` sieben worte '' and to whom gubaidulina dedicated `` silenzio . '' cello is played by maria kliegel , who has performed under the approval of rostropovich . `` in croce '' was originally written in <NUM> as a piece for organ and cello , but it is represented here in a <NUM> arrangement for cello and bayan by elsbeth moser which gubaidulina has approved . it is an exploration of `` vertical '' music ( the organ or bayan ) intersected by the `` horizontal '' ( cello ) , thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in gubaidulina 's work . personally , i prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by ivashkin and hicks released by chandos , for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan . still , kliegel 's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing , less restrained than ivashkin 's but perhaps more passionately religious . `` silenzio '' is a fragile , insubstantial piece for bayan , violin , and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo . it consists of five `` miniatures '' which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways . it is an interesting experiment , but it results in the least interesting item on this disc , and it 's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power . `` sieben worte ( seven words ) '' for cello , bayan , and strings , is a crucial piece in this disc , and in gubaidulina 's oeuvre in general . i have said before that the composer 's `` johannes-passion '' may be the greatest work of christian piety of our time , but `` sieben worte '' follows not very long behind . it is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition , and contains quotations from heinrich schuetz and clear influence from haydn . nonetheless , the bulk of the piece shows the originality of gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here , but which is included in the liner notes . the strings of the camerata transsylvanica ( ironically based in budapest after the emigration of its members ) under gyorgy selmeczi are intense and unfaltering . as is unfortunately usual with naxos discs , the weak point is the liner notes . the english and german are , inexplicably , two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other . keith anderson 's english commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional . teresa pieschacon raphael 's german commentary tells something about gubaidulina 's place in the soviet music community which english readers too should have been able to enjoy . though naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages , the profile of the performers is only in english . these three pieces , especially the last , make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer , and at an economic price . this is one of the finest works in my collection , and i sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone
one of <NUM> 's odd gems , this is one of my favorite new bands . i ca n't really explain this album , just know that it is very strange and beautiful
the major strength of this book is that it goes right to the heart of the debate on social welfare policy . who is to blame ? is it the person or is it their circumstances ? normally hysterics on both extremes of the political spectrum try to place all the blame either on society or on the person . this book makes a run at splitting the difference . frankly , i found this book better informed than the famous nickel and dimed . the truth is that poverty is a tough problem to solve , and many of the best minds on the left and the right have failed us
cute , warm & funny . not the funniest sitcom ever , but who cares . doris day is something we 'll never see again . a true original . she rocks
i am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one . ( talking about computer books ofcourse ! ) . this is especially significant when it comes to xml because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away . this book does exactly that . you will start writing decent xml right away . the following will be helpful . <NUM> . html knowledge ( a little ) <NUM> . the concept of scripts <NUM> . the concept of css <NUM> . the concept of xml when i say 'the concept of ' , i am only talking about a surface level , `` purpose of existence '' kind . even if you do n't know anything about xml , you will be fine with this book . the book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas . peace .
i read this book , translated to the portuguese , here in brazil.it was writen in nazi germany ( some little parts were writen in portugal ) . how an american thought about iii reich , living in that times ? if you read this book , you can see.the best in this book are the parts about daily live in nazi germany and in france defeated in <NUM> .
tales of avonlea is a great film to be enjoyed by children and adults . it takes you back to a more simpler , and innocent time . it will make you laugh and sometimes it will bring tears to your eyes.you will enjoy the adventures that alex , felicity , and sarah take you on . this film was beautifully made ! so , sit back and enjoy tales of avonlea and beautiful prince edward 's island
to say the least i enjoyed this book tremendously . not only for the story itself , but because of the creativity of the writing . the way the story was told it is as if i had stood next to these characters throughout their lives and lived with them through their journey . and it is a journey we all have faced at one time or another . i have become a fan of mr. perronne , and the way he made his creation become a treasured part of my collection of books . i ca n't wait to read more from this very talented writer . a job well done !
the ozarks remain one of country rocks best kept secrets . although the new musical express here in the uk described them as 'one of the finest bands of the '70 's in any field ' they are not well known - but they should be . hailing from springfield , missouri the band are amongst the most eclectic in rock , almost every band member wrote material , sang and played an array of instruments . their harmonies certainly equalled the eagles , and their sound incompassed 'down at home ' bluegrass , fm rock , melodic folk country , but also more experimental arrangements such as 'colorado song ' on their debut release . 'it 'll shine ' is the ozarks second offering and it 's great to get it on cd . there was a trend for bands in the early <NUM> 's to get back to the country , well the ozarks never really left it recording the material at a pre civil war farmhouse with glynn johns producing . there is a real joy on this disc , of a band in tune with nature and each other playing to their strengths . everyone will know larry lee 's 'jackie blue ' which was a big hit for the band and is good straight pop rock , but not entirely representative of the rest of the material , although 'look away ' and 'tidal wave ' show the band can rock . for me it 's the lighter and rootsy material that make it . 'you made it right ' with its southern gospel feel , 'lowlands ' with its magnificant harmonies and the slightly zany 'ee lawson ' typical of steve cash 's work . the disc closes with the title track leaving on a sentimental , and uplifting note . this disc is waiting to be discovered by any serious music fan - give it a try
i really like this film . first of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at . tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed . the story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children . intense , often suspensful and sometimes creepy , this is a keeper . swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve . she is amazing to watch . the rest of the cast is fine their roles , whether shady , clueless or sympathetic . well worth a view
this is a very different sounding paul simon album . the influence of brian eno is obvious and at times over-the-top . my conclusion , now that i 've had this album for a while , is that it 's not one that i 'm constantly listening to but , when i 'm in the mood , this is really an interesting and fun album . occasionally , paul reaches heights i do n't feel he 's reached since graceland . there are some great songs on here . if you 're looking for `` still crazy after all these years '' or `` <NUM> ways to leave your lover '' - type songs , you 're not going to find them here . if you 're interested in hearing paul push the envelope , however , this is the one . paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one

with so many tracks , spanning both the first and second seasons of the new doctor who series , this american listener found this soundtrack very satisfying , because it captures all those highlights and moods i loved so much from the show . all those little songs moments that you wished you could hear more of . i highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the show
fans of too short shouild get this features erik sermon , goldy , mc bred , baby d spice <NUM> , shock g , and other goodies definitely a must have plus for old heads shorty b does his tribute to maggot brain with the funkadelic inspired title track sho nuf funky
the main theme of this film is well known and very well worked out . two enemies meet in a neutral surrounding . they want to kill each other , but by one reason or another , they do n't . sounds familiar ? well here we have an extra twist - a woman . none of these three people understand each other ; they speak different languages and they have different backgrounds . there is no understanding but yet there is some . they feel each other . the film is smartly complemented by the excellent director 's work , superb acting , top cinematography , and the beautiful scenery of ( laplandia - korelia ) the northern russia - southern finland . this was the territory the soviets aggressively took away from the finns in <NUM> in the soviet - finish war ( the forgotten war ) . that is when the finish snipers and the brutal winter destroyed the soviet army but still a little country as finland could not defend itself against the soviet might . i give this film five stars and a very warm recommendation to everyone to watch it .
i give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture . otherwise , it would earn a resounding five stars . i have been waiting a long time for this film to be on dvd , but to find that they are insulting robert ryan again by providing poor quality dvds of many of his films now on dvd . most recent example in billy budd , which i also have been waiting to be on dvd for eons . both the naked spur and billy budd should have been given first class treatment . naked is only marginally superious to the vhs due to the soft picture ( mann 's other westerns have been transferred better ) . my vhs copy of billy budd is superior to the dvd . i definitely wo n't buy the dvd . another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of billy budd were deleted in order to fit it on the dvd . i wonder which scenes they were . as for the naked spur , it is another ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality . it is amazing how an actor such as ryan can interpret malevolence so well , yet be a peace activist in real life . when ryan 's ben vandergroat cooly murders jesse tate , his deep seated cold bloodedness , which has only been talked about up to that point in the film , occurs at the moment when ben kills jesse . ryan 's final line to janet leigh as he lays in ambush for james stewart and ralph meeker encapsulates his situation : `` pretty soon roy and your friend howie are gon na show up . then i 'll get me some more insurance against dying young .
the cd includes versions of & quot ; all or nothing & quot ; and & quot ; dov'and l'amore & quot ; . the & quot ; all or nothing & quot ; remixes are fantastic , specially 'almighty definite mix ' . all & quot ; dov ' e l'amore & quot ; versions are great , with a special attention to 'tony moran 's anthem mix ' and 'ray roc 's latin soul vocal mix ' , turning this new single one of her bests . the beautiful cover follows the same style of the & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; collection and the show in las vegas , available in vhs and dvd , a must have !
predating the whole pop-metal explosion of the later <NUM> 's by a few years , def leppard 's <NUM> masterpiece `` pyromania '' still is a shining of how metal sensibilities can successfully merge with pop to create something that has integrity , substance and not an inkling of self parody ( which def leppard would end up falling prety to themselves in a few short years after this album ) . i became a def leppard fan with their <NUM> album high 'n ' dry but pyromania took things to an entirely different level . the songwriting in particular stands as some of the best and catchiest of the <NUM> 's ( or any decade for that matter ) . the band never sounded better and this was the last album for a while that drummer rick allen would play an acoustic kit on as he had n't had his tragic <NUM> car wreck yet in which he would lose his left arm . singer joe elliot 's voice was its strongest as well displaying a great range throughoug the wide range of songs on this album . guitarist steve clark along with pete willis ( who would be sacked shortly before this album was completed ) create a great guitar team . peter collen only contributed some solos to this album as he joined really late in the game , but his solo on the track stagefright ( my favorite dl tune of all time btw ) is amazing in both his note choice & chops in addition to his feel . bassist rick savage and drummer rick allen create a rock solid rhythm section in the vein of ac/dc and add to the proceedings without drawing too much attention to themselves . producer robert `` mutt '' lange would contribue to a co-writer on most tracks in addition to adding a very clean and crips sheen to all of the tracks . this is one of the most well mixed rock/metal albums ever . to be honest , there 's not much more i can say about how great this album is that other countless reviewers have already stated . this is def leppard at the height of their powers/creativity and unfortunately beginning slightly with hysteria , the world would see the band crumble into self parody and an endless sea of wretched power ballads . essential !
great seller - this is one of my favorite cd 's - too , too cool !
this dual cd set unambiguously deserves many more stars than just a puny five ! i have heard none finer . and only a few cds of equal quality . the legendary miklos rozsa is the film 's composer . this is the inaugural release of rozsa 's complete score for the <NUM> film ben hur ( bh ) . the cds contain <NUM> tracks in the same order as in the composer 's original score . by `` complete , '' i mean there is more music here than there was actually in the film . this is because the cds include unedited cues and music from film outtakes plus one alternative track . the vast majority of tracks were recorded on the m-g-m sound stage with sizable orchestras of up to <NUM> performers . the result is sound of intense richness , but not to the point where ensembles over whelmed individual instruments ( of which there were quite a few `` unusual '' ones ) . not surprisingly , rozsa won an academy award for bh ( his third ) . while you can debate which of rozsa 's score is his best ( my personal favorite is his music for the <NUM> film the red house ) , there is no debate over the undisputed fact that all his <NUM> or so film composition are simply ( or very close to ) magnificent . the cd booklet is over-the-top outstanding , and easily the most extensive ever created . more of a book than a booklet , it 's authors , marilee bradford ( ms. bradford is also produced the cd set ) and the late tony thomas , have provided us with a definitive source of reference . rozsa was probably the only composer of his time who could create the score for bh . this cd set is probably the only recording of our time that demands to be in your collection . william flanigan , ph.d
this book , and the glimpse it provides into the lives of these strong women , gives hope to the catholic church and to the world . it is the women who have challenged the church , called it to task for not being all that it must be , and who have yet remained faithful to the church -- or at least to the call of the spirit -- who are and will be the agents of change that is so deperately needed in our world today .
allen 's september ( <NUM> ) suffered from highly dismissive reviews which remains consistent with the public 's view that allen should produce comedies . allen 's willingness to risk , whether he fails or not , should be a clear invitation to consider this piece if just for the purpose of contrasting his present work with earlier films that defined him as a professional funny man . the discerning viewer might enjoy this character study about six people if he or she wants a piece that demands a bit more reflection . as other reviewers wisely point out , allen borrows from chekov , particularly uncle vanya , in september and shows us how selfishness and thoughtlessness have their repercussions on innocent bystanders . but the plot unfolds carefully as lane ( mia farrow ) struggles to deal with unrequited love for a struggling writer ( sam waterston ) and an unwelcome guest in her mother ( elaine stritch ) . i tend to favor the scenes which take place in candlelight . lane 's best friend , stephanie , ( dianne wiest ) plays the piano as various characters reveal their fears and desires in carefully constructed monologues and dialogues . we learn a great deal about how professional concerns do not always eclipse the existential questions people face or the reality that people can go on living while harboring painful regrets . eventually , a particular truth surfaces which sends the characters reeling but allen gives us a reprieve by offering an ending that is fair albeit unnerving . allen fans who enjoy his comdies should switch gears to view this film . like his more sober films , september offers viewers the pleasure of character development as the fuel which moves the film forward .
unlike some of the other `` mondo '' albums , this collection may not be representative of the breadth and depth of indian music , but it makes for great listening all the same . `` mondo asian '' features primarily the polished , intricately textured compositions of r.a. rahman , billed as `` india 's greatest contemporary film composer '' . the cd cover continues : `` by incorporating western production styles and sensibilities to indian traditions , rahman has created a music that is universal even as it is distinctly indian . '' traditional indian instruments and vocal techniques merge with western harmonies and structures to create compositions that are as fascinating as they are fun . especially striking are the hypnotic track # <NUM> , `` gropika poornima '' , and track # <NUM> , the mysterious and sinuous `` suno re '' , which was written by rahman 's student , vishal
my mother enjoyed this product . i bought it for her as a gift
mr . powers leaves every other mark twain biographer in the dust . this work is not only beautifully detailed and researched ; it is a constantly engaging 'page turner . ' beyond all that mr. power 's own gift as a writer is extraordinary ... his words literally leap from the page . one of the best reads i have had in a long time
in just the first few minutes i began to feel the burn this workout works all the leg muscles . you will feel as though you have run a marathon ! ! !
this album 's music is well arranged , with a seductive blend of spanish guitar and violin . i 've enjoyed every track , and have recommended his music to my music loving friends ! !
after reading kingston 's & quot ; the woman warrior , & quot ; i thought i 'd read & quot ; china men. & quot ; i am not disapointed at all . & quot ; china men & quot ; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of chinese men in america from the 1840s to the vietnam war . although kingston uses as much chinese myth in this book as she does in & quot ; the woman warrior , & quot ; she apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated . even so , kingston 's stories and the way in which she recounts them is absolutely splendid
i loved watching this movie on tv and purchased it for my father for fathers day . its sooo hard to find something he does n't already have and i thought he would really enjoy this movie .
i first heard this album on a trip to ireland . the women artists on this album epitomize the soul of a beautiful land -- the cd quality is awesome -- i recommend to all who want to expand their tastes
after expecting `` the english patient , part vi '' we were pleasantly surprised to see ralph fiennes head off into uncharted waters . a dark blend of `` nineteen eighty-four '' and `` brazil '' emerges in a fully-formed recreation of the stalinist revolutionary state , with subreferences to practically every dictator who graced the twentieth century . donald sutherland has a chance to shine in a fabulous castro-esque ( the early years ) beard , and we were also highly impressed with lara flynn boyle , and tom hollander as the son-turned-heir , an unfortunate dictatorial truth still being played out in north korea . mr. hollander was suitably portrayed as a short man next to the leggy boyle , and the 1950s peronist costumes set an appropriate tone . draw whatever conclusions you will from the film 's final scenes- they are the results of torture and re-education camps- but many russian , cuban , argentinian , north korean , chinese , afghani , italian , cambodian , george orwellian dissidents would agree that `` land of the blind '' is a superbly accurate and ironic piece of work .
very good , bu not as good as the other films of michael douglas.i dont understand the price.why full screen is higher price than widescreen
i read all of the <NUM> herriot books when i was in high school , but i find i 'm getting so much more out of them as an adult . mr. herriot is a delightful companion to take along on an overseas flight , but you should be prepared to explain to your seatmates why you are laughing so hard that tears are streaming down your face
i thought it was a good story of boys growing up in a world of hardship
this book changed me from a stravinsky-like & quot ; music has no meaning & quot ; stance . i still do n't think that music is sad or happy or like a day in the country , things are more complicated than that , but i no longer feel that music is an empty if beautiful vessel . instead music , like all actions ( and non-actions ) , is political . i only give it a four because i would recommend her next book far more
i found that the first 2-3 volumes of this dark horse reprint were n't as good as the first comics translations from several years ago , but do n't be discouraged . the quality picks up in volume three , and enough can not be said about this series . it is one of the finest comic series ever written : a violent , visceral , absorbing story that deserves to be read rather than read about
back in the <NUM> 's and <NUM> 's ( even the <NUM> 's going back to milton brown and bob ) western swing was in a class all it 's own . either you loved it or not , in most cases there was no inbetween . bob wills and the texas playboys swore to great fame as did bob 's steel player leon . milton brown who started it all would of ruled the roost if not for his early death in the late <NUM> 's . spade cooley was a real favorite even had a tv show and at one time was bigger then them all except he ended up doing time for a murder rap . he was the first to coin the phrase `` western swing '' . over the years there were many others like curly williams , tex williams , elton brittand pee wee king to name a few.but when i want to hear some of the finest swing music from who i believe to be the greastest western swing song writer as well as artist there is only one choice , '' hank penny and his radio cowboys '' . hank is about the most under rated country and western artist ever to go on the stage . his music is second to none and his lyrics can stop a coon in it 's tracks ! if you want to really get the best music that hank ever put out it is essential to get this cd '' crazy rhytm '' along with his 2cd set `` king of hillbilly bebop '' . both of these sets will open a whole new world of western swing to any listener . if you never heard of hank penny or heard his music you are in for a treat . his lead female singer was the great jaye p. morgan who had great fame in the <NUM> 's and <NUM> 's as a crooner . i admit that this music is not for everyone and i would bet that only about <NUM> % of todays so called country music enthusiasts will apperciate this goldmine of classics . hits like `` flamin'mamie '' and `` peroxide blond '' are some of the best `` hillbilly '' music that will ever be recorded . `` wide open spaces '' and `` little red wagon '' are classics that only hank could pull off.this is the real thing if your love of music is like mine ( my wife has adopted `` western swing '' as one of her favorite sounds also ) . again please keep in mind if your idea of country music is watching some half baked , half naked , b-girl , bimbo on a perverted modern video that they now show on tv singing worthless songs that sound no more country then perry como , but just like pop hits from the <NUM> 's then this classic music ai n't for you , believe me it ai n't . if your idea of enjoying music is sitting back and listening to ernest tubb singing `` i 'm like driftwood on the river of regret '' then i 'm certain you will dig hank ! `` enjoy '' joe kopec
this is rob lowe 's best work . it shows just how talented an actor he is . all of the acting is superb . john glover is dispicable , but good . the sailing photography is gorgeous . the sailing lingo is right on . it 's a twisting movie that keeps one guessing until the very end . now , if we could only get it in dvd with outtakes . when is the studio going to wake up
another excellent cd i 'd recommend to all ages , even us oldsters !
if one hears the name sandburg , the first thing to come to mind is probably & quot ; fog & quot ; or & quot ; city of big shoulders. & quot ; but in reading this wonderful memoir , we are reminded of what a fine prose writer the man was . the tale of his struggling swedish immigrant parents finding their way in late nineteenth century america and young & quot ; charley & quot ; as he liked to be called , as the name carl marked him as a foreigner , is a fascinating glimpse of a bygone time and place . the interesting jobs that young carl took on , such as traveling the back roads selling stereo-optican views , and his conversations with a civil war vet are rewarding and insightful . i believe this is a wonderful read for anyone with a love of biography , history , or simply good storytelling
there are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less . its made by people on computers who are n't necessarily musicians and do n't play any real instruments , therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience . well for those of you still trapped in that mindset i invite you to check out `` one '' . not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music . i was not aware of dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were i believe more world/ethno music in nature . `` one '' is truly a blend of electronic , techno , world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass . the vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking . highlights are the opener `` waiting for spring '' , `` close to us '' & my personal favorite `` a way to love '' . also included and i believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of the moody blues `` nights in white satin '' . this record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be
i recently put my vinyl onto a cd , and had a chance to revisit this be-uuu-tiful work . i agree with another reviewer that `` sweetheart '' alone is worth the price of admission . if you like a combination of jazz , blues , pop ... heck , no labels necessary . in the words of her own song ( from another album : `` label it garbage/label it art/you ca n't call it soul/you 'll have to call it heart '' . so if you love serious good music , get this album
all we need to know about dog breeds of the world are there in atlas .
the princess bride is one of my all-time favorites . it 's incredibly funny and entertaining . my main reason to write a review is to inform the general public that s. morgenstern is a narrating device used by william goldman : this is not an `` abridged '' book , every word was written by goldman . all hail goldman . so do n't spend the rest of your life searching for the `` original '' -- -this is it
the compact size of this book makes it easy to keep handy , and it is full of useful information . some may ( through personal experience ) disagree with parts of it , but it will be invaluable to any new owner as it covers such an array of topics . the easily readable style does n't talk down to you , but is as if you have a friend talking to you . i think it is excellent
......... before playing mama feelgood , or vocalist lyn collins is going to leave your home in need of some repairs . from the guitar-piano-guitar introduction , collins delivers a funk tour-de-force performance in a classic song on a great soundtrack for an underrated movie that stars fred williamson . the score was composed by james brown and fred wesley , which starts with a smoking r & b number - down and out in new york city - and ends drenched in the blues - like it is , like it was . it is four consecutive numbers which makes black caesar not only a remarkable soundtrack , but one of the best albums ever issued by brown . the mid-tempo of boss bounces into brown at his funky best - make it good to yourself . collins then tears it up , with the ballad - mama 's dead - a gem of an emotional ride by brown . there are several instrumentals , with the jazzy sportin ' life and the quick pace in chase emerging as the best . brown wore the crown as `` the godfather of soul '' after the soundtrack was released in february <NUM> . and the soundtrack leaves no doubt that j.b. set the rules for admittance into the court of funky royalty .
on the soundtrack to the movie staying alive , the not-too-popular sequel to saturday night fever , there are five original bee gees ' compositions and recordings ( the woman in you , i love you too much , breakout , life goes on and someone belonging to someone ) . we hear an edited version of stayin ' alive ( only the movie title carries the g ) . the originally released <NUM> minute and <NUM> second version of the song is heard during the film 's end credits when john travolta struts through times square . the film was directed by hollywood great sylvester stallone , and makes a very short cameo appearance in the opening credits . sylvester 's brother frank , appeared in the film as tony , a bandmate of cynthia rhodes who played one of travolta 's love interests . frank performs far from over , moody girl and with rhodes , never gon na give you up . rhodes performs finding out the hard way solo . the almost unheard of tommy faragher performs look out for number one and ( we dance ) so close to the fire . released in <NUM> as was another bee gees ' production , kenny rogers ' eyes that see in the dark album
well-written , though-provoking survey of the social , legal and political terrain of `` family '' policy , and the competing theories and practices thereto . hopefully this will lead to a more intellectually honest discussion of `` the place of families '' in american law .
i picked this book up not knowing what it was about , just knowing that it had won the pulitzer . i have now read it twice ; the first time i read it i thought very highly of it , but the second time i read it i not only looked at it as one of the greatest american classics of our time but i looked at it as a fun , early <NUM> 's , college book . one part of the book i exspecially liked was when martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time ! i love it ! sinclair lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode ! this is lewis ' finest work , a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career . a must have book
this is a highly emotional and well-written work that explores a very taboo subject matter . the play revolves a case of forbidden love , in this case , giovanni 's incestuous love for his sister annabella . it 's pretty easy to figure out after the first few pages that the play will have a tragic ending , but there are several major surprises that happen along the way , and the final scene is unbelievably violent . i 'd love the chance to stage a production of & quot ; tis pity & quot ; one of these days ... from a directorial standpoint , the script is filled with many interesting possibilities
being a fan of the divine comedy since they released casanova in <NUM> , i was really looking forward to their latest album . much like a lot of previous releases by the dc , this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it . when i first listened to it , i was disappointed with most of the early tracks and did n't listen beyond track <NUM> . however , repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection . track-by-track : <NUM> . to die a virgin - amusing lyrics , but the melody does n't do anything for me . opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here , this being no exception . it sounds a bit flat to me . <NUM> . mother dear - an unusual country track with a catchy melody , but a far too repetitive chorus . musically it 's great , but the constant repetition of `` mother dear '' quickly becomes tiresome . <NUM> . diva lady - not bad , but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by neil hannon . annoyingly it sticks in your head - i 'd rather it did n't ! <NUM> . a lady of a certain age - beautiful melodies , wonderful instrumentation , and moving lyrics . i 've always liked hannon 's voice , but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to . stunning . <NUM> . the light of day - a bright , upbeat melody , again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the dc have always done so well . <NUM> . threesome - a charming <NUM> minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album . <NUM> . party fears two - elsewhere i 've hear people calling the plough pompous ; if any track sounds pompous , it is this one . i have n't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that is n't all that special . the chorus is better than the verse , but this just sounds out of place here . <NUM> . arthur c. clarke 's mysterious world - this one 's quite odd . i did n't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you . great lyrics , a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies . very well composed indeed . <NUM> . the plough - as i mentioned earlier , i could n't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous . it 's an absolute masterpiece . a wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track . a similar feel to the certainty of chance or freedom road , this is one of the best tracks i have ever heard from the dc . <NUM> . count grassi 's passage over piedmont - the opening melody links well from the plough . great melodies throughout , an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics , not dissimilar to the booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over . very special , and unique ! <NUM> . snowball in negative - yet again , the orchestral arrangements are superb . interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos , showing that threesome was n't such an anomaly after all . the ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out , but this track wraps up the album well . apart from the first few tracks , this is possibly the best dc album i 've ever heard . it 's right up there with promenade and fin de siecle and is a welcome reminder that hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon . beautiful
it m a y depend on your mood . if u r a highbrow critic and only embrace `` la strada '' , bergman , fellini , minnelli , `` cabaret '' and so forth u may be the <NUM> giving this film only <NUM> point ... but if u have a sense of humour , satire and respect for ageing superstars not past their prime - this is the <NUM> for u ... naturally , miss mae delivers her most famous lines and there are moments of embarresment - but on the whole - she still is magnetic and of amazing vitality being at the age of <NUM> .... the supporting cast is god ( dom deluise a real treat ) but so is timothy , ringo and tony ... yup , the musical sequences are below average , but as i pointed out , is done with an awareness of humour ... many a spectator would wish mae west had ` n done this , but i must say , she does not come badly out of it ...
to tell you the truth i had never read the book before because the libary always has other holds on it but i went ahead and wacthed this movie with my sister and younger brother we were hoping we would enjoy it despit bad reveiws , so it turns out we liked it , my sister said it 's seem 's more of a remake of lord of the rings ( as everyone else does ) the dragon was wonerfully done we liked the fact that it had a mind of it 's own . ed spellers did better than i thought for a newcomer , i always enjoy jeremy irons ( exepct for the really bad d & d ) the only miscast really was john malvoich as the evil king i just think he did n't fit well , overall a pretty good fantasy not a classic but good enough for me . ( it 's my 3rd favariet dragon movie besides dragonheart and dragonslayer i highly recommend those )
these days , you do n't see many people with the interest or guts to do what jon stewart and his co-workers do . in america , the book , they aim to teach misinformed americans what their government is really about . many people do n't actually know what the heck goes on in the government , nor do they care . the book , filled with hilarious tidbits , great explanations , and well thought out presentations , aims to make the government interesting . it 's got history , how the government works , modern day conflicts , theories , ideas , people , and what our founders did for this great nation . it should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen . jon stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this . they went against the grain and did what they knew was right . it 's our duty as americans to criticize the government . when there 's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it , you have the responsibility to fix it . hopefully this has changed america
why do some people try to analyze what songs neil decides to play . just enjoy an excellent cd . for the ones who do n't think crazy horse is a good band , listen to their first album . it would be a hit today on alternative country stations . danny whitten was a very good song writer , and his songs have been recorded by three dog night , rod stewart , and the indigo girls to name a few . there is not a bad song on this cd . if you do n't like c'mon baby it 's probably because you never had the man shine his light in your eyes . keep these great releases coming
this is a great book , and well worth purchasing if you want to learn about finances for investment properties . it is not all that it could be , but do n't let that stop you from using it to get started . all that having been said , here are the things that i had to be careful about : <NUM> ) ten performance measurements and ratios are presented in chapter <NUM> , and they represent the heart of the book . there is little overview of which ones are most importance or how to use or weigh conflicting or offsetting results . <NUM> ) the book is heavily centered on spreadsheets , which the author offers to sell to you . others have criticized the spreadsheets for being locked . i used the book to recreate my own version of the spreadsheets , and the extensive explanations in the book helped , mostly , to make sure that i got the underlying formulas correct . what i noticed , however , is that the book sorely needed a financially sophisticated editor . for example , the spreadsheet on page <NUM> has an entry for `` expense/foot . '' in fact , this entry is none other than the oer - operating expense ratio - that was developed in chapter <NUM> . why go to all the trouble to create and define ratios , if you are n't then going to use them . other parts of the spreadsheets were equally problematic . for example , the net cf 's - presumably `` cash flow '' - for a <NUM> year exit only had the receipts for years <NUM> and <NUM> , and not for year <NUM> . lastly , the book has nothing to say about ( a ) maintaining and growing a real estate portfolio of multiple properties as opposed to a single property , or ( b ) evaluating the relatively new <NUM> multiple tenants in common investments that some long time owners are trading into in order to stop being a full time property manager as well as an investor .
this john wayne western movie is great . i intend to make it a part of my dvd library including other western classics .
the author has a unique way of keeping you captivated and he will renew your thoughts about wolves . this book was recommended , it was not something i would have read , but after reading it i could hardly put it down , i found myself clued to this book , very funny and touching at the same time . this by far was the most revealing book about wild animals i have ever read . you will not regret reading this book ; i bought <NUM> others after reading it .
i wanted to express my agreement with the september <NUM> review of understanding paranoia in the journal of nervous and mental disease , that says , `` this book is an important and useful work ... beneficial to laypersons ... also helpful for clinicians ... a valuable guide . '' to me , that says it all .
is there a better hollywood musical ? i do n't think so ! julie andrews is phenomenal !
robert mann , a former congressional aide , fails to disappoint in his comprehensive political history of the nation 's longest war . mann focuses on the politics and policy that led to the worst military defeat in american history . for the most part , `` a grand delusion '' turns its gaze away from the action on the ground in indochina , examining instead the decisions that policymakers in washington faced during the war , the political pressures brought to bear on them , and the choices that they made over the course of twenty-five years . mann finds the roots of american involvement in the bitter political debates that erupted following the `` loss '' of china and north korea 's invasion of its southern neighbor , as president truman suffered mortal political damage from his apparent inability to stem the communist tide in asia . from those disasters , american policymakers took the first of several dangerous delusions : no politician could survive if he allowed an asian country to fall to a communist government . as the situation in south vietnam deteriorated in the face of a virulent and effective communist insurgency , us government officials stirred more `` delusions '' into the policymaking mix : after the debacle at munich in <NUM> , the west must always use force against its enemies , regardless of the nature of the threat or the national interests implicated ; the vietcong guerillas were communists first and nationalists second , with their foremost goal the spread of global communism and not national independence from the french ; the unification of vietnam under communist leadership would threaten other american allies in southeast asia ; america 's national security depended on the success of the south vietnamese government ; and south vietnam was ultimately capable of mustering the will , the political reforms , and military capability to defend itself , provided that the us stood by it until it could do so . each of these assumptions , according to mann , was disastrously wrong . mann charts how these assumptions , like the progression of a fatal illness , infected every step of the policymaking process , leading five presidents to escalate america 's involvement . mann guides the reader through the internal debates that led policymakers down this dangerous path , showing how officials from both parties clung to these false assumptions and how these delusions informed their decisions . mann pays special attention to the relationship between the white house and the senate , the branch of congress that the founders expected to have more of a role in foreign affairs because of its longer terms and power over appointments and treaties . perhaps the most tragic figure in this book is senator mike mansfield , the majority leader through much of the war , who suppressed his doubts about the war out of political loyalty to the president and the sense that the senate must not undermine the commander in chief in a time of war . indeed , much of the book is a story of how congress threw aside its constitutional responsibilities to declare war and provide oversight to the executive 's foreign policy , and how it slowly reclaimed those powers . the book has a few defects . the book contains far too many spelling and grammatical errors . also , at times , the narrative bogs down in bureaucratic minutiae , leaving some passages as interesting as a typical inter-office memo . still , the book is a noteworthy addition to the literature of the vietnam war by reminding us how it came about and why . if anything , it has only become more relevant since it was first published : readers will find haunting parallels , for instance , between vietnamization and `` as iraqis stand up , we will stand down . ''
this is the version of this film to have . many other versions are out there but the quality of those are severely lacking . the film is outstandingly clear and every bit as wonderful as i remembered . the vast array of special features are fascinating . this is the one john wayne film everyone should have
it does n't matter how you like your humor , straight up , or on the rocks , the black adder is your man . from the `` foretelling '' , where between liberal interpretation of w.s . combined with the ruthless , crazy , humor likened to the firesign theater , and a deep well of humor about their own `` bloody '' history , to the end of the disc- '' the black seal '' , if you do n't laugh for at least <NUM> minutes of its <NUM> minute length , and this goes for the first <NUM> black adder disc 's , and come away with a tired mind , keeping up with all the historical references , fractured or not , spun off by the excellent writing team of curtis & elton , along with a small cast of veteran engligh actors , peter cook , brian blessed , anon , anon , then i say you better have your funny bone looked after , because you are in danger of loosing your sense of humor . also i would suggest buying a copy of the black adder by penguin books . it will help , when the humor comes too fast and is in the kings english , because you do not want to miss one joke , reference , or twisted tale of this disc .
these four discs have some of the greatest music from back then . the <NUM> songs performed by the great jimi hendrix are worth it for any jimi fan . the recording and version of his popular & quot ; purple haze & quot ; is the best i 've heard . this cd is truly on of his greatest performances . the who 's performance was also awesome , for it was their first show in america . their explosive songs amazed the crowd , and shows some of townsend 's best . these two performances are the highlights , but theyre are also many other tremendous performances with some of the best recordings i 've heard
... to get a little tilling done before someone steals and eats her . i chose this book for my second read on this subject because it has the highest ratings ( on subject ) on amazon . heinberg has done a thorough job of discussing every aspect of the coming problems to society due to a lack of petroleum - most of which i had never considered . literature about this are from the point of view of either the politician , the economist , or the geologist . he takes the view of the geologist and the future does not look good . i hold a more positive view : that human ingenuity will prevail - but i could easily be wrong . in any case , this is a worthwhile read for anyone . of particular interest is the chapter that deals with alternate energy sources . the next time you read about an alternate energy source in the news , you 'll remember the real pro 's and con 's from an expert . quick synopsis of <NUM> page alternative fuel chapter from `` party 's over : '' natural gas : can not be shipped from overseas easily like oil - is more difficult to extract economically every year - is being depleted like oil . in view of the precarious status of north american gas supplies , any attempt to shift to ng as an intermediate fuel would waste time and capital in the enlargement of an infrastructure that will soon be obsolete . coal : shortage not so much a problem , however , its eroei ( energy return on energy invested ) and pollution are a problem . as the richer seams are exhausted , it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades . nuclear : electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive , but only if direct costs are considered . when adding in plant construction , safety , reactor decommissioning , and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed . there are currently <NUM> reactors operating worldwide . france in the only country in europe still building them . only asia expects to expand significantly . only a few of the highly touted fast breeder reactors have been built , and they have proven to be prohibitively expensive . the us currently processes enough uranium to fuel existing us reactors for the next <NUM> years . the mining process is wasteful , polluting , and dangerous . when all things are considered , the eroei on nuclear energy is fairly low and there is significant intangible downside . wind : of all renewables ( not depletable ) , wind power usage on a global scale is being developed the fastest . technology has advanced - it no longer kills birds because it uses slower fan speeds and the fans are mounted on a vertical axis . it can operate in more variable wind speeds and the cost is declining rapidly . soon your own equipment could be bought and used on your own property . wind has the best eroei and germany leads the world in its usage . on a large scale , wind power would require vastly new infrastructure , but it is the most practical alternative so far . problem : can not easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs . solar : technology advancing rapidly , photovoltaic the best so far . research is advancing into diverse methods of collection , including such easy methods of application as solar buckyball collectors incorporated into house paint . tremendous potential , would need new infrastructure . problem : can not easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs . hydrogen : for now , the process of hydrogen production always uses more energy than the resulting hydrogen will yield . for one thing , hydrogen is not an energy source , but an energy carrier . it 's production depends on continued usage of the dwindling supply of natural gas . there is new technology , however , and reason to be optimistic . as with wind and solar , a whole new infrastructure , requiring time and investments of huge amounts of money and energy technology are necessary . like wind and solar , hydrogen fuel cells should be central features of our plans to phase out petroleum . we should be dramatically increasing these investments . hydroelectric : in many regions of the world - and especially in the us - it is already thoroughly exploited . geothermal power , tides , and waves : limited application in limited regions of the world . biomass : wood burning - pollution and limited resources in a world with <NUM> billion people - imagine the world being one big easter island . ethanol : costs more energy to produce than it eventually delivers to society . brazil is the poster child , but is burning down rain forests to grow sugar cane . cold-fusion : pseudoscience conservation - efficiency and curtailment : will be crucial in cushioning impacts from the depletion of oil . but it is not a panacea - even when you ignore cheaters ( individuals and countries ) . saudi saying : my grandfather rode a camel . my father rode in a car . i fly a jet airplane . my grandson will ride a camel .
dante xxi what a fantastic album ! a huge achievement by a band that continues to produce excellent music despite a huge amount of criticism from fans of cavalera-era sepultura . it 's surprising that people ca n't get over the fact that max cavalera left a whole decade ago . since then sep have moved on and i doubt they would have made dante xxi had max still been at the helm . frankly , bands should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of themselves and their fans . if you follow a band , it 's sometimes worth having a little faith in them , i feel . i guess we fall in love with a band after hearing a couple of albums and that those albums become the band . but the band themselves have a totally different perspective ! the music they produce is a product of the dynamics of the members of the band , their abilities , relative strengths , experience , musical preferences etcetera . all of these factors can change over time ; indeed should change over time . hence , aspects of sep 's music have changed also . how sad would it be to say that sepultura had learnt nothing new in the last <NUM> years ? that their music had been influenced by nothing that has happened to them ? why would anyone want them to keep copying the sound of their earlier work ? would you really want sepultura to just regurgitate arise and chaos ad tracks ? would n't that just put them on a par with bands like status quo ? how utterly tragic that would be . when playing live , they play a huge number of older songs because they know we want to hear them too . so , if you want older stuff , do n't expect it on a new album - go see them live . they 're better live than on a disc any day ! dante xxi is certainly more consistently thrashy than their other post-cavalera output . ( so , if you 've been missing that aspect of sepultura : here it is ! ) green 's vocals are awesome ; there are terrific riffs and fantastic rhythm . it 's hard to pick a favourite , but if pressed , i 'd recommend you listen to 'fighting on ' - and turn it up very loud ! with dante xxi , sepultura continue to successfully broaden the musical boundaries of both themselves and their fans . so , set aside your preconceptions and give this album a good listen - you 'll love it .
this dvd set has all <NUM> games with detroit , and games <NUM> and <NUM> of the mets series . of course , commercial free with great audio and video . world series victories do n't come around often , and this set offers a great way to preserve those memories . i have been watching replays of these games on fox midwest , but twenty years from now ( when the cards have wrapped up <NUM> or <NUM> more ws victories thanks to coach of the year <NUM> albert pujols ) these games will still be preserved for me , long after they are regulars on cable tv . the bonus dvd is neat too , with interviews from many on the team . a lot of funny stuff , with people spraying champagne all over eachother while trying to interview . good , candid stuff that you do n't get to see during the course of a regular season . if you or your loved one is a serious cardinals fan like i am , this is a must have ! ! ! -dav
this is as good as it gets folks . this is one fantastic record . i could not list the best songs because they are all good . the vocals are absolutely awesome . i love the sound quality , production , and dynamics of this record . i highly suggest that you pick this one up
now i do not pretend to know everything there is to know about tears for fears ... but .... i love this cd ! from start to finish ! it is truely a conceptual masterpiece ! i was fortunate enough to see this performed live in detroit at st. andrews music hall .... incredible band incredible musicians ... but roland wrote it all ! he is truely a master ... and minus curt too he is still as good as ever ! its a darn shame that this did not get airplay and the concert only showed up as a small tiny ad in the corner of the local jam rag ... but the show was incredible the album has given to many a spin in my car cd player ... it was in rotation there for about an entire year and often times repeated ! references to lennon and mccartney are made and i think they are right on cue ! roland is a true pop genius ! who can really rock out too ! who ever said pop songs had to be boring eh ? just see this band perform one time if you are lucky enough ! somewhere i see he appologized to radiohead for playing the song creep but i saw him perform it with complete perfection ! the stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a huge venue in a small tiny club ! the lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a great one to own ! conceptual and perfection in a pop record ! give this band more credit ! the poor website for this album set desolate for more than several years no activity ! shame its a low down dirty crying shame ..... music has no support for the fine artists such as tears for fears ... however roland and curt you have my forever support you are both true genius 's
`` dear gordon : remember the days when you showed such promise ? before you sold me your soul in exchange for super-stardom ? you , andy & stewart really concocted a rockin ' brew of punk , jazz , funk , pop sensibility and , oh yeah , 'reggatta ' . heh heh heh . well , as our bargin dictates , you owe me another mercedes commercial . reminds me -- phil collins and the dude with the dreds from counting crows owe me another disney soundtrack and coke commercial , respectively . ciao , my little corporate huckster ! xoxo , beelzebub . ps - how 's the whole tantric thing working out ? better make it <NUM> mercedes commercials .
this is a true mccullough masterpiece . written in his usual flowing prose , he recounts the events leading up to possibly the most catastrophic natural disaster to date in american history . on may <NUM> , <NUM> the dam at the south fork fishing and hunting club burst following torrential rains of some 6-8 inches . his vivid description of the aftermath , death and suffering is chilling . he provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least . the events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well . the south fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite americans ( e.g . carnegie ) . the club was situated up the valley from johnstown , pennsylvania . the dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster . many argued that it 's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains . the dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event . many joked about it , but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely . following a late spring holiday parade in <NUM> , the `` impossible '' occured . the dam gave way , and the lake entered the valley , sweeping locomotives , train tracks , woods , houses , stores along with it . entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to johnstown . the death toll was some <NUM> . mccullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath . the corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat , with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster . the blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the south fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve . it 's a tale of early conspicuous consumption , and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything . along the way , mccullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings . the development steel mills , railroads , refineries , labor conditions , and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of johnstown . also , details of death counts at the make shift morgues , financial support during the aftermath ( president harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $ 300.00 ) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader . eerie recounts of coroners ' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl . clara barton began organizing the american red cross in <NUM> . she had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to <NUM> . her work at johnstown earned her dinner with the president harrison in washington following her five months of pure dedication in johnstown . this is a fantastic book . the katrina disaster sparked my interest and i was not disappointed . if only clara barton were head of the red cross during the katrina aftermath ..
it seems like when it comes to the pixies , the talk is generally `` surfer rosa this '' and `` doolittle that , '' and while those are certainly good albums i 've never figured out why bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors . with the exception of trompe le monde ( which i plan on getting around to eventually , i swear ) i 've heard pretty much the pixies ' whole output , and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often . bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the pixies ' earlier career down just a bit , but in their place is a more arty , spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band 's already wide-ranging sound . sure , there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of broken face or tame , but for track-by-track excellence and diversity bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top . after the blistering , hard-rocking instrumental opener cecilia ann sets the tone , bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the <NUM> 's would n't even dream of . with black francis screaming his head off at full volume , the angry , assaultive rock music sounds like debaser on steroids , but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums . songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions , making bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors , but it 's one more than worth acquiring . this album represents the pixies ' peak as musicians ( at least to that point ) ; the rawer edges from surfer rosa and doolittle had definitely been toned down , but those albums did n't contain anything quite like the complex , talking heads-like rhythms of dig for fire or the dense , proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of down to the well . the pixies ' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here : just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring , etheral velouria , or the way black francis 's eery vocals and kim deal 's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of is she weird . all over the world is one of the strangest things the pixies ever did , a sprawling epic ( by pixies standards , anyway ) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from joey santiago that seem to come out of nowhere . and is that a falsetto black francis is doing with his voice ? well , yeah , most of the time , but it works perfectly for the song 's trippy , drug-like feel . even when they 're plowing ahead at full speed , as on allison and hang wire , the band 's more tuneful , surf-rock direction is apparent , but it 's even more evident on pleasant , literally pacific tracks like ana and the closing havalina . my enduring favorite from this album , though , would have to be happening . it does n't start off all that unusually for a pixies song , with black francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs , but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented , with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix , culminating in black francis 's stream-of-consciousness , half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out . it 's a total classic , just like this album , and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something
as a big military history reader i have to say this book was excellent . i do n't recommend very many books but this was great especially for people already familiar with wwii . it takes you inside the dfeat of the german army . very great observations from high ranking german officer mixed with views from the foot soldier . gives a great perspective on the german army and the internal divisions it had
this wonderful classic is worth watching again and again . my sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed ( a pleasant surprise-since he 's not hip on old movies ) . he thought the film would be so out of date as far as stunts , special effects , etc . that he 'd be bored to tears , but this film has stood up to the test of time , perhaps because it was ahead of its time . i never get tired of watching o'toole 's performance as the brash , impressionable young lawrence who strives to help keep arabia in the hands of the arabs , despite the wishes of his british commanders . at one point lawrence develops a 'god complex ' , only to be brought back to the reality that he 's just and ordinary man with weaknesses . this realization does n't stop him from attempting to do something extraordinary ... chrissy k. mcvay - autho
i 'm afraid alfonso lozada has missed the point . the film is about a span of time in the life of one person , tony wilson , and is thus structured around his experiences . at the same time , the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account . on top of all this , the & quot ; tony & quot ; character does mention the short shrift the stone roses get . is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film
& quot ; clearing your clutter & quot ; as meryl starr so wonderfully says , is a great step by step method that enables a person to take the right approach without getting overwelmed by the task in sight . my husband and i decided to make our lives more organized so things would run a little more smoothly in our home . the book allows you to go to a chapter and empower you with great ideas and solutions . by having chapters at your fingertips this is making our task alot easier . i would highly recomend buying this well thought out and easy to read book
what a combination ! releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid white stripes fans from detroit ! i 'm sure that jack white is n't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated . musicians just love the music ...... it 's the critics who need to take a hike . this is a great album that showcases both great traditional bluegrass and well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass . so ..... quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is ..... a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience
i have now retracted an earlier negative review . i have played it since and enjoyed it . i was overly critical . i do play it and enjoy it . ( one and only love album ) really does blow this one away though and i play it all the time ( <NUM> stars )
it should be known that the incredible marley marl did produce this album . but , the man who was responsible for the beats was k-def ! he did funky child , chief rocka , here comes the lords , lord jazz hit me one time , and from da bricks . all of the standouts on the album . he went on to become a member of the group real live , which also consisted of rapper larry-o . they were apart of marley marl 's house of hits production team . they released one album `` the turnaround : a long awaited drama . '' for all hip-hip heads , this is an album that needs to be in collection . he also produced several songs on the lords 2nd album . one standout is `` what i 'm after . '' it is safe to say , that k-def is responsible for most if not all of the lords best known songs . if this album is considered a classic , then it should be said that k-def and marley marl deserves credit . peace . madsci ... i write because i suffer , inc. passaic n
simply put , this is a classic . the album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able ' . black thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound . the guest appearances are great too . this is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are

branford marsalis ' new recording of coltrane 's masterpiece , a love supreme , is superb on many levels . if you 're a fan of trane , and even just luke-warm on branford , i 'm confident you 'll find this to be a very worthwhile purchase . competent but lesser musicians playing als would try to channel trane and the classic quartet . not branford . he is a mature artist with a fully-realized style . he sometimes lovingly quotes trane , or puts his own spin on a trane riff , but he is clearly his own man on this recording of a love supreme . jeff tain watts understands the essence of elvin and elvin 's contribution to als . but , like branford , tain is his own man here . he 's great as a sideman , and plays a great solo at the end of resolution . joey calderazzo - an outstanding pianist who has done excellent and original work with many of today 's top jazz artists - falls into mccoy mode in his first solo , but then plays like himself in his second one . both are great solos , but i think it shows a real maturity and confidence to be yourself rather than emulate the masters when playing their great works . the bassist , eric revis , is very good , but i 'm partial to robert hurst 's performance on branford 's earlier recording of als . it 's worth comparing that earlier performance to the new one . branford first recorded als ten years ago for a cd compilation called `` stolen moments : red , hot & blue '' . that version is much shorter - only about <NUM> minutes , compared to the full-length version on the new dvd/cd combo . on the older version , branford 's quartet went into the studio , did n't rehearse much ( they were all fine musicians and all knew als ) , and started the tape rolling . it is a wonderful performance , and well-worth having in your collection . but it sounds like they are not trying to record anything original , just to have a fun time playing trane 's music . ( be warned , though , that most of that cd contains acid jazz & hip hop . ) in contrast , the new recording does have a bit more of branford 's personality and interpretation . for example , the chord changes in acknowledgement are clearly different than on trane 's original recording - not so different to be annoying or trite - but different enough to let you know that branford has something new to say . plus , in the <NUM> years since the earlier recording , branford has grown from a very good but young musician to a true master in his own right , and this is evident on the new recording . the sound & picture quality are phenomenal . i have about a dozen concert dvds covering various genres . this is easily the best sounding & looking of them all . my tv/dvd player is plugged into a mere bookshelf stereo ( albeit a good one ) , and the sound was superb . then , i took the dvd over to a friend 's house who has dolby 5.1 home theater sound , and my god , i thought i was in the club with the musicians ! the picture quality matches the sound quality . i viewed this dvd on a high-definition wide screen tv , and it was really quite thrilling . the dvd includes a bunch of interviews . first is a 30-minute interview between branford and alice coltrane . she talks a lot about trane , his music , his relentless pursuit of perfection , some reminiscing about when he wrote als , and she and branford have interesting exchanges about the nature of jazz and other topics . then there are a bunch of shorter interviews on various aspects of als , including some with michael brecker . i think the interviews are insightful and add value to an already great disc . finally , there 's a brief segment called `` branford casual '' that shows branford walking around town , working out at the gym , practicing some classical music on the soprano , rehearsing with his quartet , and misc backstage tour footage . neat , but not essential . amazingly , you get all this for the price of a cd . and the package includes an audio cd of the concert performance as a bonus !
nearly every song on the album is up to the same high standard set by the title track , & quot ; heaven. & quot ; the tunes are memorable , the instrumentals enhance the vocals rather than being barely-noticeable fillers , and the lyrics are a refreshing change from the hackneyed lyrics one often gets on christian radio stations . as one of the other reviewers has said , this drew criticism from some , but anyone who listens carefully will see that the christianity is there . it 's subtle rather than in-your-face , and thus does n't get tiresome . & quot ; heaven & quot ; is an album that can and should be listened to over and over
i am reading the fifth edition of this book . in the earlier editions the book was published in three or four volumes . the fifth edition is a combination of all volumes . so that is good . the book is a dense read . but the content is excellent . there are <NUM> chapters in this book . each chapter written by different authors - experts in respective areas . so the book provides a best of breed treatment to various assorted topics . however , not all chapters are good ( but most are ) . i 'd say about <NUM> or so are of filler kind of chapters . nothing really special in them . but the book is worth for the rest of the matter . the chapters are also written to provoke further thought into each area . kind of `` first principles '' approach - which i like compared to the cissp guide approach of `` here is the information , now devour it for the exam '' . however this book is not an exam guide ( and i knew that before hand ) . i bought this book for the matter in it and i am very satisfied . if you are the kind of person who want to quickly assimilate and regurgitate the matter for cissp , then dont even bother . i am kind of person who loves to read things from the basics slowly , getting the concepts and ideas all clear in my mind and hence i plan to finish this book before reading cissp exam guide ( which by the way is also sitting on my bookshelf ) . however i have a major complaint againg the publishers . having charged one hundred thirty dollars for a <NUM> page book , i 'd expect the quality of paper is decent . the paper is so thin , i invariably turn two pages when i am thiking it is one page . it is so thin , even turning the page carefully damages the paper . i agree that the content is specialized and most authors hold at least two or more certifications ( cissp , cisa , sscp etc . ) , but that does not warrant printing the book on really wafer thin transparent paper . sure , the publishers need to make money , but not by compromising the quality of the paper so much . and you 'd expect this kind of book to live on your shelf for a long long time than `` teach yourself crap in <NUM> hours '' books , but the quality of paper will make that unlikely . hence i am giving <NUM> stars to a book which otherwise would deserve <NUM> star
game on , this is good stuff ! to be honest , i wanted to like ray 's first solo stag a lot more than i did , which is why i walked , not ran to prom , but then that was before i caught the indigo girls last summer , where ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem let it ring . it was the first time i 'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up . the theme throughout is pretty obvious , it 's called prom , after all . but it 's also pretty obvious that you did n't have to grow up queer in small town rural america to feel like a freak . the sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal , after all . but beyond waxing poetic about adolescence , there are some great cuts offering stories of love 's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry , as well . this album is less gritty than stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect . this outing is to ray as all that we let in is to indigo girls . the album showcases the elements we 've come to expect from ray and the indigo girls : unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship . those are rare commodities in today 's music industry . unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the prom .
if you 're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s california pop-rock sound ' ( and who in the right mind is n't ? ) , then the late nicolette larson 's <NUM> album `` in the nick of time '' is an album you should definitely have in your collection . this was nicolette 's follow up to her debut album , <NUM> 's `` nicolette '' , and it 's actually a better album , easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on `` nicolette '' in favor of infectious , no-nonsense pop-rock . although `` in the nick of time '' is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks , it 's largely a splendid album . nicolette 's fun , innocently sexy presence and her irresistible , husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with `` dancin ' jones '' and `` breaking too many hearts '' , the driving , riffy pop-rocker `` just in the nick of time '' , & `` daddy '' which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol ' california sound . also great is the breezy , feel-good ballad `` fallen '' , & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored `` rio de janeiro blue '' ( which is suspiciously , and strikingly , reminiscent of steely dan 's `` your gold teeth '' , especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track ) . `` back in my arms again '' , a motown cover , is n't exactly a great song in the first place , but it 's given an agreeably energetic performance . the cover of karla bonoff 's `` is n't it always love '' is nicely done , though it 's quite similar to karla 's own version & not as strong , & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky little feat cover `` trouble '' which is quite annoying . the biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with michael mcdonald `` let me go , love '' which is a splendid , soothing ballad . as with the previous & subsequent albums , this one was produced by ted templeman , & it seems he & nicolette were an ideal match . if all you have by nicolette is her compilation cd `` the very best of nicolette larson '' on rhino records and you think it 's all you need of her , think again -- the only track from `` in the nick of time '' included on there is `` let me go , love '' . originally released in october of <NUM> on warner bros. , a big thumbs up to wounded bird records for reissuing this highly recommended album on cd in february of <NUM> -- the sound quality on this version is phenomenal . wounded bird commonly releases two-fers , i.e . cds with two albums on <NUM> disc ; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album `` nicolette '' -- they would easily fit on a single cd -- but it 's still a pleasure to see that they 've been re-released , and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain . for any nicolette fan , `` in the nick of time '' is unquestionably a must-have .
my wife and i saw this band at slim 's in san francisco saturday night and i must tell you , there was some definite shoegazing going on . for those of you who do n't know what shoegazing is , i 'll explain it as simple as possible . picture the band standing on stage , staring down at their shoes ( hence the term , `` shoegazing '' ) as they release a continuous hum of fuzz and distortion from their guitars . when it 's done right , as film school does , it can be very powerful . the floors , tables , chairs , and even my chest was vibrating to the sound . film school is much more than this , however . in most songs , their shoegazing is limited to just portions of the song . the songs are broken up by wonderful vocal melodies , baselines , and guitar picking . you will hear what i mean when you listen to this album . highly recommended
janeway has opened an entire new world to me . as an avid reader who has a book in almost every room in the house including the garage , bathroom , and who reads during ironing , doing homework , or waiting for sugar to boil for making english toffee , i can almost assuredly recognize not only genres but also the various nuances within the genres . just as women in this day and age tend to head towards tough broads who can fend for themselves in a man 's world , janeway brings in a cop whose adoration of written materal causes him to leave his probably more steady job as a policemen , to enter the world of rare books . an occasional job will bring in enough money to support his chosen lifestyle for a while , but more than that , his introduction into the interesting and secretive world of bibliophiles . these books not only whet my appetite for this world , but also introduces me to both real people and real books that helped to shape our world from behind the scenes . janeway 's current flame has an old friend ( who also delved into books ) killed , and she wants him to find out who did it an what t he motive was . in doing so he ends up becoming involved in his lover 's old friends and flames , so of which should be left undisturbed . but janeway never is one to back down from a fight over 'rights and wrongs ' , and he doesnt ' do that in this book either . i get the feeling when i read other reviews that the readers want something less complicated than what janeway provides . if uncomplicated is what the readers want then they should go to other books , becasue there are times in janeway 's books that you just have to go back and understand why certain things are said or done in a true historical background and reality . i wish janeway could write fast than he does , because i thoroughly enjoy these very educated mysteries , but then , if he did write that way janeway would not be as enjoyable as he is . karen l. sadle
i find it quite interesting the one reader who slams le ly is also the only reader in all of these posts who neglected to leave a name or email address . also the following statement was included `` the viet congs lied , tortured , and killed numerous innocent people to get what they want . '' hmmmm that sounds like the exact same things the americans did ! also the following statement is made `` it 's pathetic how low she would go to make a buck off the same capitalist system that she and the communists despised do much that they had to engage in a war that turned many people 's lives upside down , to drive the americans out '' that 's kinda funny accusing the vietnamese of starting a war because it 's likely there never would have been a war had americans stayed in america . the vietcong were no more worse human beings than the americans they were fighting against . the vietcong were true patriots no different than american patriots and visitors to vietnam today will find many ex-vietcong are friendly and civil to american visitors . a good book with one more account of how innocent people are effected by the war

guns n'roses are one of my all time favorite bands , so this album is a little disappointing , do n't get me wrong , nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving . it just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right , just look at led zeppelin 's greatist hits . the only reason the record label released this anyways was because axl was taking way to long for chinese domocracy and they wanted some money , so they put this out , and it has gathered a good deal of money . this album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know , that guns n ' roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time . they came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior , and they did just that , they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music . songs like november rain , welcome to the jungle , and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points , thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan . i would reccomend buying all their albums though , because all of them are genius , except for the spaghetti incident , which was just a cover album anyways . this album did fail to include classic cuts like mr.brownstone , it ai n't easy , nighttrain , rocket queen , and others and for that i am angry . also , how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here , it is simply terrible , possibly the worst guns n ' roses song ever . so , if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums , do n't get this , save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come , there have been rumors of a release before the year 's end . i have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible , cuts like madagascar , the blues , rhiad and the bedouins reaffirmed my belief in axl , and i think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge . also check out a band called rose hill drive , they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them .
i was born in <NUM> , i 'm young i know . but i grew up listening to bands like guns-n-roses , poison , ozzy osbourne , whitesnake , and so on , because of my dad . i grew out of that phase , got in with the boyband thing , until the late <NUM> 's when i re-discovered the great music that was the <NUM> 's . i fell in love with the power ballads , i ca n't begin to explain when listening to a great song like that feels like . its completely awesome , and vh1 has done a great job diggin out the good music and the music that should still be , not the crap they are playing now .
this is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear . tracyanne campbell and her band mates in camera obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow glasgow musicians belle and sebastian . it does n't help that like belle and sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands . but although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands , especially when imogen campbell takes the vocals instead of murdoch , there are also significant differences . campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than stuart murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate . she lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody , though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies . but murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today , so the comparison is unfair to her . on the other hand , most of campbell 's lyrics express emotions that i can relate to far more easily than murdoch 's . he may be the greater artist , but she lives pretty much where i do . camera obscura turned out two very good albums before this one , but this is easily their best effort yet . all of the songs are consistently excellent and campbell 's lovely voice graces everyone . she is a remarkably subtle singer , very gifted in her phrasing and expression . but as fine as she is as a singer , she is better as a songwriter . i like a lot of the cuts on this disc , in particular `` i need all the friends i can get '' and the truly sad `` dory previn , '' about the young mia farrow breaking up her and andre previn 's marriage . but my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary `` lloyd , i 'm ready to be heartbroken , '' named for one of lloyd cole 's best songs on his classic album rattlesnakes , `` are you ready to be heartbroken ? '' all in all , this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far . i think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves belle and sebastian , but also to people who are drawn to mazzy star . the album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums . basically , if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music , this is going to win your heart
here 's the deal if you have not seen the series do n't watch this movie . it would take far to many words to explain the series it is something that has to be watched to get . my only notes are that it 's not that hard to follow as long as you are good at paying attention to details ( and of course you have seen the series and did honestly pay attention to it ) . other reviewers i 'm sure have summed up what it 's about . the movie is basically the action packed , mine-trip , fight scene , blood-n-gore of the end that many said was lacking in the last twp episodes of the series ( i.e . what ` s happening `` out side '' of the characters minds in reality ) . this movie is just as deep and sometimes down right confusing as the series , and that ` s why i like it . for me mixing parts of this movie with the series episodes <NUM> and <NUM> was vary satisfying . many say watching the movie between episodes <NUM> and <NUM> seems right . but really it would take a huge edit job to get it right . all the parts are there you just need to rearrange them the to make them right in my opinion
fran lebowitz is sometimes referred to as the successor to dorothy parker . a few similarities are apparent . both are sharp-witted , female new yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners . yet , if parker could be considered a painter of the urban american landscape in the 1920s through 1950s , lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s . i do n't think she has parker 's depth or sense of structure . her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin . and she often relies way too heavily on puns . several pieces in this collection fall flat for me . yet others - such as her advice to heiresses , `` at home with pope ron , '' and `` the last laugh '' - were quite clever . i think she 's worth reading as perhaps one of the leading humorists of her generation . comparisons with the more versatile and compelling parker are a bit of a stretch , though
my daughter loves this dvd ! at age <NUM> she can already say her abcs , recognize all the letters individually , and even write some small words . this is a wonderful , educational dvd
this soundtrack is excellent . there is not a single song that i skip when listening to the cd . the mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great . anita nalick , breathe ( 2a.m . ) is worth the price of the album .
deadly feasts : tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book . it tracks the discovery of prions , the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease , scrapie , and creutzfeldt jacob disease . following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties , bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties , and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on , rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases . i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists , from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation , yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school , to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were . but this is n't just a story of scientific discovery . as the foreboding subtitle blares , rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions . these include spontaneous formation , responsible for the known early cases of creutzfeldt jacob disease , trans-species infection , including mad cow disease and scrapie , the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response , and hardiness of the disease . one scary factoid : a scientist took a sample of scrapie , froze it , baked it for an hour at <NUM> degrees ( celsius ) , and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample . for all the uneasiness this book inspires , it certainly does n't offer any answers . a condemnation of industrial agriculture , a warning that it 's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe , and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue . to be fair , it was printed in <NUM> -- perhaps things are under control now .
i would say that this is one of my favorite books . tozer communicates in a way that makes you think . he knows how to make you get you thinking about your 'religious ' ways and pursue the living god . this man can communicate in a way that is not over your head , but yet takes you deep . if you have n't read this book and would like to have a more intimate relationship with him , this book is a very good place to start as it will direct you to the god of the word
my twins love this book and the others in this series . their vocabulary has greatly increased and they are delighted with their knowledge . perfect for the two year old in your life
while steely dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion , the latest `` definitive collection '' brings some of the band 's best known work onto a single disc . also , for completeness , one track each from their 'reunion ' cds are included here . steely classics such as `` do it again '' , `` reelin ' in the years '' , `` rikki do n't lose that number '' , `` black friday '' , `` deacon blues '' , `` peg '' and `` hey nineteen '' are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day . while this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning dan fan because of its songs and low price , it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this definitive collection - the all-time classic `` josie '' . granted , this cd is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish . however , including `` josie '' and dropping a track like , say `` dirty work '' ( writer 's opinion ) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall . i guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection . apart from this , steely dan 's `` definitive collection '' is a great introduction to the band . for a more comprehensive overview , check out the double-disc compilation `` show biz kids '' which includes all of the tracks included here ( minus the two 'reunion ' tracks ) plus many many more .
although some people might not like the melancholic feel of this movie , it a well done piece exploring the theme of personal redemption and forgiveness . people do n't always approach these topics in the same way and this movie does n't try to spin a single , simple answer . the notable cast works well creating a compelling tale . a great movie to talk about after viewing . highly recommend
this is an enjoyable book that gives one pause to think about the words one reads in novels . written by an english prof ; it gives insight into the meaning of words ; especially as the are used in books
this is perhaps , najee 's finest cd . it has real , qualitative jazz flavorings . this is what `` smooth jazz '' is all about . the entire cd is worth the price and then some . this cd is definetly worth five stars
being a big fan of anime comedy ( the intelligent , yet lame humor ) i was eager to see el hazard `` the magnificent world '' . because of the high price of the set , i had some hesitation ( because of some poor reviews on amazon ) . well , i have to say that the bad reviews are wrong . this dvd series was totally awesome ( although i admit it started a bit slow ) . i promise the more you keep watching , the better it gets . the plot is highly intelligent ( involving dimensional and time travel ) and the characters are very interesting ( with distinctive special powers ) . some say the humor in el hazard is juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , and seriously what good comedy is n't juvenile ? some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve a doomsday device ) , to which i respond `` do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star '' ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer did a great job . the dvd menu presentation is beautiful , and the box is very elegant too . hopefully you can get this set for around <NUM> dollars on ebay ( beware of bootlegs ) . it 's very hard to find a good authentic set . the sequel `` alternative world '' which i just ordered , individually should cost around <NUM> dollars if you shop smart . for my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend `` niea under <NUM> '' and `` his and her circumstances '' . animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4 total= 4.4 star
this is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow-up to anne of the green gables . it is great to see megan follows as anne shirley once again . megan follows is just perfect in this role . anne shirley is now a bit older , has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings . this gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable . it is very endearing in many ways as was the original
in <NUM> , chris columbus ( mrs. doubtfire , harry potter , home alone , etc . ) adapted jonathan larson 's beloved rock opera from stage to film and did a grand job in it . this soundtrack is a product of the music heard in the movie , and it as just as better as ever . with the usuals returning in <NUM> of the <NUM> main parts - rapp , pascal , menzel , diggs , martin , and heredia - there were still <NUM> parts left open as daphne rubin-vega ( mimi ) and fredi walker ( joanne ) declined . fortunatley , this soundtrack features two amazingly beautiful voices from their replacements who many consider are as good , and in my personal opinion are better , than the first two gals . tracie thoms plays joanne with dignity and a range that could knock someone over as she brings the house down with the famous high note in `` seasons of love . '' rosario dawson ( sin city , alexander ) has the best performance of her career as mimi , where she can sexily serenade any listener in `` out tonight '' and reduce some to tears in `` goodbye love . '' with most of the highlights sung in this film , some songs are better in this version ; while songs here are in its broadway 's parallel 's shadow . then there are some songs on here that do justice to their counterpart and they are both equally good . some improvments on this track are `` seasons of love , '' `` rent , '' `` without you , '' `` santa fe , '' `` tango maureen , '' and `` will i ? '' overall , just go get it . it 's amazing . your ears will thank you
a journey to the center of the earth did not turn out to be quite what i was expecting ; i ca n't say quite why , however , because i 'm not entirely certain what those expectations were . i had n't read the novel previously , but i thought i knew what it was about . as a result , i think i was expecting more drama than verne delivers , or perhaps i simply wanted the book to be more than it is . most likely i was conflating verne 's novel with other texts : movie adaptations of the novel itself , for instance , in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism -- as opposed to the perils of nature itself -- occurs ; or hollow world stories , in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth 's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet 's center . a journey to the center of the earth is neither of these things , of course , and if i underwent any disillusionment , it was purely of my own making . understood on its own terms , the novel is , at the very least , interesting , but , truthfully , not much happens . the narrator 's speculations ( as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail ) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place . much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels , and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger , dehydration , or equipment loss . in fact , as best i can judge , they really do n't approach anywhere near the center of the earth , although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing . the real joy is the interactions between the characters , primarily the trio of protagonists : the young narrator , his scientist uncle , and their silent , idiosyncratic guide . the expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor , whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes ; his nephew , the narrator , alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings , and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them ; hans , the guide , says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner , and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once , even while under the earth ( a square deal , in his eyes ) . their interactions with each other , and with the variety of icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress , are wittily and cleverly depicted . these character moments are the high point of the novel ; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with verne and how much is an invention of the translator ( who , in this edition , remains sadly anonymous ) . whether the novel 's tone in its english version is added or simply preserved in translation , full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is . though one reflexively considers jules verne a `` science fiction '' writer of a primitive sort , this is really more of an adventure tale and , taken as such , it is generally successful . the adventurers do n't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know , but if the reader does n't go in expecting flights of pure fancy , the novel is rather satisfying . postscript : i should point out that this review refers to the signet classic mass market paperback edition of the novel , which features an afterword by michael dirda . knowing amazon , it 's possible that this review will surface under several different versions , and without clarity , we have nothing .
this wonderful book is not just full of recipes , but full of memories . any cook book can list ingredients and directions , but not all of them also contain stories about the recipes . mrs. small 's crab cakes are delicious and i do n't blame dorothy small for keeping it to herself until the very end . thank you , lari robling and mark thomas
talk about movies for guys who like movies , this is one joy ride for sure ! ! ! david hess deserves the best actor oscar for this completely ridiculous performance that makes you laugh one second , then become slack-jawed the next . for the fellas , we get bush , nice boobs and some good action ..... for the chicks , you might want to rent another flick ... haha ..... enjoy ! !
i personally do n't like repetitive boom * tch-boom * tch-boom * tch type of music that goes on for <NUM> minutes , erlende oye does a great job of selecting songs that are catchy but does n't get played out easily . maybe i 'm biased too , i like kings of convenience and royksopp , but this album is very upbeat , funky , yet diverse ( phoenix , avenue d ) . there 's no categorizing it , electro , house , pop , it 's just good catchy beats
to put it simply , if you 're a star trek fan you 'll like this season . if you 're not , you 'll probably find that some of the episodes are weak on plot or character interaction . however , there are some gems hidden among the these episodes . the klingon sub-plot gets its starting point here and the season finale is legendary in nextgen canon . season <NUM> really begins to reveal what nextgen was really all about . all in all much better than seasons <NUM> and <NUM>
i enjoy reading many different genres , but historical fiction is one of my favorites ...... and lately , the cultures of india , sudan , and any of the countries in that exotic section of this wonderful world seems to satisfy my reading addiction . the twentieth wife is a rich , exotic view of the women , their desires , and females ' position in society in the mughal empire of <NUM> 's india . i could `` feel '' india as i read the story of menhurrisa . this girl knew what she wanted at the early age of <NUM> and kept her focus on the love for a man she first saw in a parade . almost all woman in that era would consider love for a man like this unattainable .......... royalty above her class . this was a book that i could n't get enough of . i looked forward to the next page at all times . i enjoy reading a book that takes me mentally to another time and place . by reading this book , i learned a lot about the ancient 17th century indian cultures of women and harem life , which had a class system of its own that the women had to deal with . i highly recommend reading this book if you like historical fiction or if you enjoy reading a story of a strong woman who believes in herself and beats all odds to attain her desires . i read this book about <NUM> 1/2 years ago and the story has stayed in my memory . i bought the sequel , the feast of roses , last year and plan on reading it as soon as i finish the historical fiction novel that i am now reading set in <NUM> england . if you are looking for an awesome book , and very good historical fiction with surprising twists and turns spiced with a whole lot of action ...... this is a book you will truly devour . i highly recommend this read . b harris
` the villa ' was magnificent nora roberts 's novel . the basis story is about a family of wine makers who find themselves fighting to save the family business after numerous murders , bad business , affairs and fire ~ all with a mix of romance . this book has some nice twists that you will enjoy . if you are looking for fun romance with a story i would also suggest kate angell ` crazy for you ' and the ice house by minette walters
my initial interest in the book was a result of an accident . i stumbled upon a television program where <NUM> guys in suits are being interviewed in a park . the comparisons between a starfish and i spider compelled me to purchase the book . simply stated , the starfish and the spider is an excellent book . management styles and corporate culture are not spellbinding topics , however the authors present the subject matter clearly with historical and present day references . i use craigslist and could easily relate to the sense of community . this book is a must read for those in business brick n ' mortar or an internet based ; for those with a desire to understand how a college student , with an idea for sharing music , brought an industry to it 's knees
i was enchanted by this comedy/drama when i saw it as a youngster , and i must say the enchantment has not been diminished by time . a wonderfully directed and filmed faustian story , quintessentially american in tone , both its content and style were remarkable for those times , over <NUM> years ago . it is played with a light touch despite it 's deep and atmospheric ( and marvelous ) cinematography by joseph august and it 's often moody score by bernard herrmann . of course one wonders if the film would have the same buoyancy and sense of fun , despite the dark themes , if any actor played mr. scratch other than the truly wonderful walter huston . he is simply terrific here , and his performance alone is worth the price of admission . countering huston 's sly , mischievous , grinning devil is another great character actor with the gravitas to match him , and that 's edward arnold as daniel webster . i like the opening credits wherein director dieterle lists all the behind the scenes talent without titles , including himself , and at the end states `` who collaborated on this film '' . it is truly a collaboration with director and cinematographer and composer and editor ( robert wise ) all on the same page . it has some striking moments , most especially the first encounter with belle ( simone simon ) , the ghostly dance at jabez stone 's mansion , and the final eerie trial . the supporting performances , especially the always reliable jane darwell as ma stone are fine . james craig as jabez stone was a bit of a stiff , but the movie 's overall qualities compensate for him . simone simon is luscious , and the honestly presented depiction of her adulterous relationship with jabez is quite daring for the times ( one wonders how it got past the hays office ) . this came out in <NUM> , and arnold 's stirring defense of jabez that exhalts all things american in the land and character of it 's people may strike some as corny , but this was made on the cusp of world war ii , and these things needed to be said then , and in a lower key , some of which would n't hurt us to be reminded of now . and , finally , there is the last great shot of huston 's scratch eating the stolen peach pie and then musingly rubbing his chin as he looks out directly at us in search of his next victim . perfect .
instead of a new sabbath album , we get this . now i know a new sabbath album is in the works , but that 's just what the fans want to hear - new material . nevertheless , dio 's greatest hits with sabbath is still a swell purchase . odds are if you are a true sabbath fan , you already own all the dio-era sabbath , but now you can own all the goodies in one cd . post dio sabbath was mediocre at best , so you can be rest assured that dio sabbath is as good as it was going to get . after reviewing the tracks on here , i 'm a little upset that southern cross was not on here . if there 's one song that pulls out the best from iommi and dio , it 's that one . it 's got edge , balls , and guts . however , the rest of the tracks are pure classics and definitely do not disappoint . so , if you 're a fan , you 'll probably by it cause you like to collect things . if you already own the previous albums , the choice is yours . the only discernable difference that i can tell is the obvious production value . mob rules sounds horrible on its own , and the few tracks from mob rules will sound great on this disc
ministry 's `` bad blood '' is the best song on the whole album . but could have added some techno like , orbital , aphex twin , chemical brothers , and fatboy slim . they should have added `` come to daddy ( pappy mix ) '' to the album . or maybe `` head like a hole
john cleese brought his monty python insanity and `` fawlty towers '' confusion to a fish called wanda , a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it . what i really appreciate about the film is that comedy finally got its due : kevin kline won the best supporting actor oscar for his inspired portrayal of otto , the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but ca n't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else . twenty years later , i still laugh out loud at his performance . i believe michael palin won the british academy award for best supporting actor as well -- and he 's hilarious as well ! ( i 've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged : peter sellers should have won for dr. strangelove and steve martin should 've been at least nominated for all of me and then nominated for best supporting actor for little shop of horrors . ) everything about wanda works , even the little winks such as the name of cleese 's character , archibald leech -- which was cary grant 's real name ( grant and cleese both come from the same part of england ) . a fish called wanda is a comedy worthy of serious study . no kidding
i 'm pretty new to these guys , figured i 'd take some time to dig into german goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the us , by which i mean all the pioneers from the <NUM> 's or <NUM> 's are either gone , changed tracks , or sold out to that crappy early <NUM> 's house tekno sound . these guys have a little of that crappy house sound that you would expect from about <NUM> % of the so called german goth bands now a days ( and sadly now skinny puppy as well ) , but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which i can really sink my teeth into , also some of it does kind of tug at the ol ' psych a bit , which is a good thing , but it is no where near as amazing as skinny puppy was in its glory days ... ... everything pre-process , though the process was still `` pretty good '' for the most part
different people are struck by different things in movies , and what struck me about this one is that it is about community . people always form themselves into little villages , even if only one block square in a big city . there 's always a vague , loose hierarchy , with what you could call the village elders at the top -- in the case of this movie , cedric the entertainer . then you 've got the laziest and most dishonest at the bottom -- that would be the guy who cheats on his girlfriend and sticks another woman under his bed when she shows up unexpectedly . the barbershop itself is the community gathering place . that 's really what this movie is about -- community , neighborhood , and how people interact in it
i purchased all four season on july 17th . there has been no problems with the discs . i hope others will purchase these so that all eight seasons will be available for fans
i saw this movie also and loved it . questions : why do people feel the need to tell the entire story when giving reviews ? just say what you liked about the movie give your critiques only some of you folks told the whole d .... movie . also to acorn `` jcorn59483 '' blalock is described as `` genius and unbridled ambition and taylor is described as `` loyal and dedication '' ? ? ? did you see the same movie as the rest of us . or are you unaware of your own unconscious prejudices ? ? also to another reviewer did not taylor have a major contribution to the valve that saved the life of blue babies ? ? ? maybe i should see the movie again . you gave the credit to blalock and some other caucasian doctor only ? ? racism and prejudices are such complexities of the `` american life '' some of us live it every day and say `` what ! ... not me ! while others live and deal with it every day ! how obsurd to call the genius of vivien taylor `` loyal and dedicated '' this man had no formal medical training yet he went toe to toe with a doctor who was at the top of his field . who was the real genius here !
a masterful volume . the breadth and scope of this work leaves one breathless . oh , if only the world would read and understand this - we 'd all be better off ..
this book was chosen as one of the books to be read and discussed by my men 's book club . the author 's treatment of the creation is absolutely spell binding and very convincing to an engineer . the way in which the author finds god 's face in so many things is interesting and absorbing . i had trouble putting it down , it reads so easily
i enjoyed hawaii five-o as a schoolboy decades ago on a black and white tv , and it is a real pleasure to see it in a crisp clear colour version on dvd . one thing that made this series so good ( as i now see ) was that , apart from being set in 'paradise ' , as its worthy successor magnum p.i . would be , there was no set formula for the stories ; the variety is constantly surprising . the two-part story of how mcgarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one i remember from childhood . the series ( and dvd ) have been so well made that it easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago . i suppose 'paradise ' never ages or gets dull . i look forward to the whole series coming out on dvd , the sooner , the better ! highly recommended
i first saw help ! when i was in middle school , rifling through my parents ' vhs collection . my friends and i were won over by this silly comedy and the fab four , and i have treasured the movie ever since . it is unfortunate that the us dvd release is out of print ( i had to buy an imported version ) , and i hope they bring it back soon , so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy . the plot is pure genius in its simplicity : a gaudy red ring gets stuck on ringo 's finger . a sacrificial cult chases him around the world , trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice . a mad scientist is determined that he could -- dare i say it ? -- rule the world , if he could only get the ring off ringo 's finger . the beatles are absolutely clueless . so they run around the world , dodging crazy people at every turn , singing songs , and generally being hilarious . the dvd i bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in french . so once you 've seen help ! enough times to know every line by heart , try it out in a foreign language , and laugh even harder at the beatles speaking in french . go ... to ... the window ... go ... to ... the window ..
this book is beautifully written . even in translation , i was amazed by how gorgeous pamuk 's prose is . some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward . the main character , ka , is a poet , and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me , but not at all in a dense or difficult way . indeed , `` snow '' flows so smoothly that i would say it 's a fairly easy read . i was n't sure if i would like this book at first because i did n't think i was particularly interested in islam and politics . i discovered that `` snow '' is primarily about god , love , beauty , happiness , death , life , and loneliness . while all the action takes place in a tiny turkish village , the themes are broad , sweeping , vast . this book will not grow dated any time soon , if ever .
i found that this book contained everything i 've been looking for : great new weapons , very useful feats , and lots of new prestige classes ( i always wanted to make a samurai ! ) & quot ; sword and fist & quot ; also contains various buildings which can be useful for dms to base , for instance , a guard tower or an elf house on . if there is anything i was dissapointed about was how little information there was on chariots , but then , the book would also be better a thousand pages long . five stars
first of all the boy is str8 from baton rouge just like lil boosie , maxminelli , lil webbie , c-loc and j-von . all these boys are gangsta 's in this game and been doin it for a min
the great thing about this movie is just how believable it is . some people i have shown it to actually thought that eddie and cruisers were a real band and that the movie was a docudrama . the characters have faults and failings and are believable , the plot is classic rock'n'roll mythology , the music is original ( mostly ) and great . john cafferty and the beaver brown band provide the real voice of eddie wilson and these guys can really rock . this soundtrack rates in my top <NUM> favorite albums to this day . `` what i want is songs that echo '' says eddie , and oh and they do . both score and movie are still fresh and relevent today . the only rock'n'roll movie i like better is eddie lives ! ( out now ) together they tell one of the best r'n ' r myths ever . get both now !
i rec 'd the item in just a couple of days and was very pleased with the service .. keep up the good work ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
just ca n't praise this cd too highly . i usually stick with classical music ( mozart , stamitz etc ) but this cd , has opened up a whole new dimension . i just play it over and over . never get tired of it .
this is not an easy movie to watch but one that can not be missed . it is about sexual abuse and its affect on children , the characters do not point fingers or blame their parents nor attacker but its a journey of self discovery whether let it be gay or straight . the movie is brutal , gritty and does not hide behind anything nor anyone . let 's the viewer know that everything beautiful tends to have dark secrets . the performances are good and greg araki is an awesome filmmaker . viewer restricted
animal farm is the best film score i have ever heard . it 's beautiful and haunting on so many levels . the songs really convey the emotion of the film ( which is really good , by the way ) beasts of the world is really reminiscent of the communist revolution . the theme storm of judgment resonates with the hope of the animals as well the darkness of napoleon 's reign . highly recommended
this dvd is more like an experince/ride , that can be enjoyed over and over the story is good and the visuals are incredible cgi , imax does not skimp on the wow factor . i own several 3d movies and this is my favorite . for the best experiance in projecting shutter glasses movies use a lcd projector not a dlp projector
this is a great movie , will definately keep you laughing at the diva 's in this movie . so what the movie is not as good and thorough as the book ( what movie is ? ) i mean if you want ever detailed in a book put on screen then we will still be sitting in the movie theatre trying to see the end
after watching the parade of nations in the opening ceremony of athen s <NUM> .... i had to buy this cd ... is amazing ....
recently i undertook the challenge of burning a `` best of <NUM> '' smoothjazz cd . the challenge was daunting , being limited to approximately <NUM> tracks . four tracks came from this wonderful cd . gregg karukas , always a skilled keyboardist , has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks . track <NUM> , `` girl in the red dress '' is a fun , upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure . track <NUM> , `` first flight home '' is an immensly sexy and driven song . track <NUM> , `` corner club '' is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun . and then there 's track <NUM> , `` isabella '' . in my opinion the best single smoothjazz track of <NUM> . it is the kind of track , when a friend asks `` what exactly is smoothjazz ? '' play `` isabella '' for them . they 'll understand . buy this cd , you 'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level .
a very good video even though it is not scripturally correct in a few places . one has to remember that it is based on a novel and not directly from the bible . magnificent scenery , excellent character selection , and very well produced . this is a video suitable to be shown to christians or non-christians alike
i 'm a big elvis fan and when i saw this on tv i thought it was great and had to have it . the way they produced this film was great . you felt like it was a live show with elvis . the way they jelled the past with the present was fanstatic . a must have for any one who is a fan of elvis , or someone just getting started .
this is a great album , it 's a mixture of pop and rock . the first side is flawless , but side two let 's us down a bit . actually 'coming soon ' is the only song i do n't like on this album . the game is queens first and probably best <NUM> 's album
first of all , a lot of people are wondering where have these guys been ? they were recently in a play entitled guilty until proven innocent . this album was great-good for when your making love . but it should have included at least four new songs on it . and they are suppose to be coming out with a greatest hit dvd . i do n't think its out yet , have anyone purchased it
not only is the inside of the book as fascinating as the beautiful cover , but the text keeps the reader from putting the book down . i could not stop turning pages and learning more about how jewish tradition meets issues of health and illness . a great read
i ca n't say it any other way . as one critic once , almodovar does n't just make movies . he is the movies ! in the light of that , he deserves his own box set . while not a complete box set of his works inclusive , this does feature a pretty good cross section of early works & recent works which confirm that almodovar is indeed a film-making genius in every sense of the word . let me also mention law of desire & matador have never been available in dvd format here in north america prior to the release of this box . it may be a shame , however , for some customers to buy this box set if they already own all the other films in the package aside from those two . on the other hand , this is a great find for many as virtually all of the films here are now very difficult to find & some are currently out of print . fortunately , i only owned bad education & talk to her on dvd before this was released so i did n't lose very much by purchasing the entire box . as far as the plots or storylines go , i think it 's fair to say the critics have already done a fantastic job so i will skip the film introductions here . i can also safely assume all of us who are shopping for almodovar films know pretty much what to expect whether it be controversy , heartfelt stories , or madcap humor . if the gods of celluloid cinema would find it in their hearts to release another box set , i would surely appreciate it as there are four more films of almodovar that are either out of print or never released in the states on dvd which would make nice gifts or great collector 's items as well . in the meantime , i 'm quite sure we are all atleast marginally pleased with the box we 've received . the box itself is quite attractive featuring nice artwork all-around , lobby cards including orignal artwork for every film included here , & a bonus disc with special features sure to please every die-hard fan . there are no individual cases for the films here but they are fastened relatively tight by spindles which tend to overlap a bit . i had initally feared that the individual discs could become dislodged in transit causing damage or scratches but everything was in it 's proper place . most of the discs themselves do n't offer much in the line of extras so they are basically standard issues with the usual subtitles , menu , & chapters . overall the quality of each movie is very good but not great . in fact , some of the discs are only a tad better quality than the old vhs tapes which are hard to find these days as well . but again , i 'm just greatful that these films are readily available so the overall picture quality may be jsut small potatoes as far as i 'm concerned . nearly all the films here are deserving of the five star rating i 've supplied even though i ca n't say that bad education was my all-time favorite . for some reason or another , i thought this was a bit too dark & i was hoping for a bit more madcap humor or warmth which almodovar is known for . nevertheless , almodovar did an excellent job & gael garcia bernal was phenomenal making bad education a worthy film to view . unfortunately , this one is as unsentimental as it gets . i can hardly wait for the release of his latest film volver on 04/03/07 . is n't life grand ? my personal rankings talk to her all about my mother women on the verge of a nervous breakdown flower of my secret law of desire live flesh matador bad education
you need something like this to eaither get the pary jumpn or even have a good day . i 'll tell you once you hit play you 'll get a smile oun your face . scatterman and snug are ingenious . matter of fact words ca n't even describe , so go ahead buy <NUM> because everyone you know is gon na want one
`` honky chateau '' is an example of why greatest hits albums just do not work for great artists . this early elton john effort is an example of when john and taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence . the whole album seems interconnected with excellent music , vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations . `` rocket man '' was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity . `` honky cat '' starts with a smart jazzy sound with elton in a cocky voice talking about his `` redneck ways '' that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song `` mellow '' , which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice `` you make me mellow , oh you make me mellow '' and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about . i like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in `` i think i am going to kill myself '' is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of `` get a little headline news , i 'd like to see what the papers say , on the state of teenage blues '' , particularly when elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category . salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with `` i have to say my friends , this road goes a long , long way '' with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics . `` amy '' is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice `` amy i may not be james dean , amy i may not be nineteen , and i may still be in romper boots and jeans , but amy you 're the girl that wrecks my dreams '' . one of the ultimate classics is `` mona lisa '' an up lifting song about a tough life in ny city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people , the poor and the affluent as elton mournfully sings `` until you 've seen this trash can dream come true , you stand at the edge while people run you through , and i thank the lord there 's people out there like you , i thank the lord there 's people out there like you '' that in the end is uplifting , that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place . finishing with a flourish , `` hercules '' is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman , a `` cat named hercules '' . the song has john with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys ' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat , it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor . `` rocket man '' is the classic song that elton used to sing for <NUM> minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best john/taupin collaboration . the additional alternate version of the western sounding `` slave '' is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core <NUM> songs are just wonderful and always memorable .
over the years i 've gotten weary of people ragging on mingus because it does n't meet their expectations - it does n't sound like joni mitchell should , it does n't sound like mingus would have wanted it to , it does n't sound like jazz should , etc. , etc . listeners should get over all that and appreciate it for what it is - a challening , beautiful , eclectic , and even mystical musical journey . it 's holding up beautifully all these years later .
robin robertson is and absolutely amazing poet ! ! i loved both his collections so much ! ! anyone who has n't read ' a painted field ' or 'slow air ' should definitely buy them ! ! they are well worth it !
my all time favorite sports movie next to `` pride of the yankees '' and `` hoosiers '' . the only criticism i have is that they should have made two endings . the `` upbeat one '' used in the hollywood release and the `` gritty downer ending '' as read from the final pages of the book . and let the viewer choose before watching the film . i 'd still pick the one used by hollywood but it would have been nice to have malmed 's literary ending also .
as a `` kind of sewer '' of these italian sexplotation flicks , capt . freaky knows a good film when he sees one ! the first of this dual dvd , `` white slave '' was not worth watching or mentioning for any reason . piss poor special effects of beheadings ... no sex in the film whatsoever ... and nothing to make anyone horny or subsequently enjoy themselves . on the other hand , the second film , `` caligula reincarnated as hitler '' was way better than what i expected . just the exceptional location of northern italy 's lake district gives it one star . furthermore , the young blonde star of the film is gorgeous and someone both men and women would find attractive to sleep with . there are some five star sexual violence scenes that are unfortunately too brief . beatings , whippings , gang raping of women prisoners , dipping naked women into vats of lime , hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats ! i mean , hey you `` sicko '' nazi fans , is this something or what ? there are no actual hard core sex scenes , however , there are multiple simulated sex scenes that are quite hot to watch . i think there is significant sexual tension in scenes throughout this very good storyline . if you are into the whole `` nazi sex slave camp '' thing .... this is by far , the best of that genre i have come across . and because i only paid $ 9.99 for this double feature ... it makes it a <NUM> star film for me by all catagories . i am curious if there is an unrated or extra cut film out there of this , as another reviewer hinted at ? if so , and they showed more actual sex , that would be the one to purchase
this is a good movie . thora birch is convincing . the story is incredible . sometimes it is a little slow but it 's worth the time one takes to see it . it 's inspirational .
the orb 's `` adventures beyond the ultraworld '' was essentially one of if not the first ambient house album ( it at least inspired other artists and ( somewhat ) popularized the genre - `` little fluffy clouds '' is a very appealing track ) . it is , admittedly , a little uneven . if you 've only heard the song `` little fluffy clouds '' , be prepared for a quick change of pace . the rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental , but for ambient fans and the open-minded it 's very interesting stuff to listen to . my personal favorites are the first three tracks , and the rest i do n't think are as fun to listen to as a whole ( they 're definitely very good , though ) . it 's not ambient in a traditional sense - there 's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible . what 's also great is how you 're essentially getting two albums for the price of one ( actually more like the price of 1.5 albums ) ! if it were n't for this fact and its influence on the world of music , i probably would 've given it a 4.5 . ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it , though . even if most people wo n't like the album as a whole , they 'll most likely enjoy `` little fluffy clouds '' . highly recommended ! highlights include : the entire album
having read and reread this book i feel confident in recommending it to anyone interested in learning to deal with with workplace conflict and cohabitation . the author persuasively and logically argues that most workplace conflict is driven by fears that we may not even be aware of . using the practical strategies put forth in the book has allowed me to gain greater understanding of where fears come from and how to cope with them . this book would be a valuable tool for anyone interested in turning discord into harmony , both at home and at work . the final section of the book suffers slightly from what felt to me like a shift in tone and emphasis . this part of the book seemed to be where the author became concerned with sharing his own personal worldview and therefore might be less useful for the hardcore business reader looking for workplace strategies to implement . that being said , i found this portion of the book to be interesting and enlightening to read simply as a human being and not as a `` business person '' . highly recommended .
apocolypto is definately a violent movie . yet , somehow , the movie would not show the brutality and the horror of the aztec civilization if it watered down this part . instead , this movie is very real , and in mel gibson 's way , has a powerful message to tell . and in the final scenes of the movie , i could see how the 'want more ' of the aztec pursuing the young man could lead to corruption , and the ultimate death . this movie is shocking , but behind all the violence and gore , there is a message that anyone can see , and despite the `` r '' rating of this movie , this movie is definately worth watching . i thought it was extremely well done
the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.the plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as director.this dvd is worth looking
this is one of my favorite books in the series . i have <NUM> of the <NUM> and i love this book . you never know whether wally is gon na go in traction or save the day until you read it
i have to confess that , while i love clapton , his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair . and i ca n't say i am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately . for me i enjoy his work with cream , his guest work , his first few albums , the one he recorded with the band , a few older live albums , and bits of the phil collins-produced record in the early 80s . after that it 's a fall-off , but i am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years . i have been listening to <NUM> a lot lately . it holds up exceedingly well . the groove is laid-back , with solid musicianship and expert song selection . it makes for great road music , especially `` willie and the hand jive , '' `` i shot the sheriff , '' and the classic closer , `` mainline florida . '' the ballads are beautiful , too . there is not a weak track on the album . there is a consistent tone , an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic `` fit '' that makes this album an overall winner in ec 's catalog . as someone who used to party in ec 's old house at <NUM> ocean boulevard in golden beach in the early 80s , let me say -- you did it ( and us ) proud
shakespeare 's _hamlet_ is the real star of the comedy _renaissance man_ . many films have featured groups of social misfits who have grown and changed through the assistance of a caring teacher , but in how many of those films has the teacher been dead for almost <NUM> years ? danny devito is funny in this family-friendly film , but it is the bard himself who shines best here . i use this film in my college-level shakespeare courses and find that it is more useful for teaching shakespeare to young adults than most of the recent film adaptations aimed at the younger generation ( _she 's the man_ and _10 things i hate about you_ come to mind ) . _renaissance man_ celebrates the magic of shakespeare that even recent films preserving shakespeare 's language , such as the _hamlet_ starring ethan hawke , do not . in _renaissance man_ , shakespeare 's beautiful language is not replaced . rather , it is read and then internalized by the characters who produce their own modernized version in the form of a rap song and chant . the film teaches about some of shakespeare 's rhetorical strategies ( e.g. , metaphor , oxymoron ) as well as his themes ( e.g. , mutability ) . while the recitation of henry the fifth 's famous `` crispin day '' speech at the end of the film is a little sappy , the characters ' reaction to and obvious enjoyment of the _henry v_ stage production is not . the characters in _renaissance man_ model for the young people of today how shakespeare should be experienced .
an almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film 's narrative , as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers , it is a dramatic technique at least as old as homer 's iliad and odyssey . what gods and generals shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man 's nobility , his rage , and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine . gods and generals sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout , the director 's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers . this nation 's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved . it was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually . the events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could . true , lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union 's preservation , but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place . the film follows the trajectory of general lee and - more prominently - virginia 's 'stonewall ' jackson . the latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led , not of himself . but his grateful men would have it no other way . 'stonewall jackson ' he would be from manassas on , and 'stonewall ' he would die . robert duvall , stephen lang , and jeff daniels do their characters proud , though it is perhaps duvall 's general lee who most rings true to the man 's decency , calm , and painful array of allegiances . mira sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the maine lieutenant coronel chamberlain 's wife , mrs. fanny chamberlain . 'war ' , one of the characters is early heard to say , 'is the sum of all evils ' and its reputed provocation by mr. lincoln ' a most dreadful mistake ' . the achievement of gods and generals is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men , who at times find fratricide thrust upon them , carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves . this film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the american republic , a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates , staining its streets , and drowning numbers of its finest
more than just a one hit album , `` i wish '' has enough pleasing and catchy tracks to merit a purchase . the production values are high , with some great backup vocals and instrumental work . in addition to `` i wish '' , `` this is how it sounds '' and `` crenshaw '' are solid . really , other than the last track , `` i wish ( street mix version ) '' , this is an entertaining album across the board with some interesting turns of phrase . skee lo 's lyrics move at a fast cadence but flow with the back tracks nicely and pause from time to time to permit room for the background singers to jump in smoothly .
... and yet i finished it in one sitting ! i will warmly recommend this book to my `` foreigner '' -friends who are willing to gain a better understanding of the filipino ways as well as to second-generation filipino kids who might just find this book helpful for understanding and perhaps appreciating their parents ' quirks . though i will need to caution them about some of the cultural/linguistic info here and there that is n't quite accurate . unfortunately - even though one might argue that the very existence of this book disproves my impression - i 'm mildly disappointed of how the protagonist , throughout the story , appears so eager to `` renounce the country of her birth '' . i feel that the book would not have been any less , had the epilogue been left out . besides , was there really a need for those david letterman 's top 10s o quasi ? the filipino society is avowingly matriarchal , mind you . so , to all of you `` westerners '' out there , better scratch that `` equality '' -part
so looks like the guys at funi are going to release <NUM> episodes from season four in a two dvd special edition . looks like we get the following , and if you do n't believe me , go to the tmnt website for hard evidence . here 's what to expect acording to the press release from funi . episodes include still nobody , the ancient one , cyon of the shredder , prodigal son , outbreak , trouble with augie , tale of master yoshi , return of savanti parts <NUM> and <NUM> , adventures in turtle-sitting , good geens parts <NUM> and <NUM> , and as for that 14th episode , could be ninja tribunal or insane in the membrane . maybe they 'll go ahead with insane , and just include the tribunal episode in its own <NUM> episode release , if this one sells good , that is . i do n't see why they could n't up the ep content to <NUM> and just go ahead and give us both . but check the tmnt website for that press release if you 're interested . and looks like the price is pretty low too . an excelent buy . but your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine , folks . maybe as the sept <NUM> release date draws nearer , someone can confirm the last episode we 're getting . oh and i forgot samurai tourists . maybe they 'll go ahead and give us insane in the membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four . and hopefully , we 'll get ninja tribunal plus the <NUM> episodes that complete that arc at a later date . maybe by christmas ? i hope so , anyway . and do i really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four ? well , i think i will anyway . but if you 're lookin for spoilers , you wo n't find them here . leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of shredder and karai last season . and after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control , splinter sends him to japan to find himself with the help of yoshi 's old master , the ancient one . but while leo is gone , a new shredder suddenly attacks the turtles , and leo must return home and do battle with this new foe . well , maybe not a new foe , but a foe with an attitude ajustment though . also in this portion of the season , slime from agent bishop 's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers ( see aliens among us from vol . 3.7 : hun on the run ) has mutated several animals near the turtles ' home . its up to them to end this outbreak , but one of them is infected by one of the creatures , causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast . now the turtles must make a deal with the devil , so to speak , in order to have their brother restored . agent bishop says he has a cure . but in order for bishop to administer it , our heros must steal a valuable object for him . they must invade the stronghold of the new shredder and steal the heart of tengu , but there are darker forces at work here . even bishop does n't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world . so save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in september !
some of the past reveiwers complained about a few things about this album , usually one of the following : <NUM> . the material is n't new . <NUM> . the material is unoriginal . <NUM> . the material is n't `` edgy '' enough . so , here are my rebuttals to these complaints , in hopes of straigtening a few things out ( sarcasm intended , since i 'm sure they really do n't care ) : <NUM> . of course it is n't new material , its called `` i 'm telling you for the last time . '' its really more of a greatest hits performance since jerry seinfeld never released an album . i agree it would have been cool to have some of his earlier performances on an album , but we do n't have the luxury , and i do n't know about you , but i 'd perfer to have my seinfeld stand up actually documented on a disc as opposed to the previous option , one minute chunks before and after an episode of his sitcom . <NUM> . there was a time when this actually was quite original . you see , jerry seinfeld got incredibly famous , and so many up and coming comedians started ripping him off that his observational comedic stylings became very common ( a point beautifully illustrated in the snl game show parody `` stand up and win '' hosted by jerry seinfeld himself ) . if the material and style sounds unoriginal , keep in mind , seinfeld pretty much did it first . <NUM> . why should comedy have to be `` edgy '' to be good ? jerry seinfeld was funny without being dirty or obscene ( the worst you hear in this cd is a handfull of `` g-d d-mns '' ) . i personally think that the r rated material is a crutch , if you ca n't be funny without being dirty , then you 're not really that good in the first place . so there you have it , my takes on the complaints against seinfelds only album . it 's some good stuff really , there 's a reason why people ripped off his act , and that reason is because he was a really funny , really sucessful comedian
hubby & i bought this book for our <NUM> month old daughter . she loves this cartoon on pbs . we loved the story & the illustrations are fantastic . a must for parents to buy for their child
if only we can all see the inner beauty in people , we will all live in a better place ! this is a cute comedy romantic movie that shows the viewer how shallow we are when it comes to physical beauty , are n't we all guilty of it . if only we can see folks for what they really are . i avoided this film for years , because of jack black , but i did catch it on tv and enjoyed the plot of the movie and eventually liked the way jack black did the role of hal . interesting pov 's and lots of funny moments in this film . <NUM> stars for jack blacks performance

i bought this cd because i loved the song nothing catches jesus by surprise ! then i found that this cd is packed full of hits . it is nice to hear so many of his songs played on the radio , not just one or two from this cd . it shows the quality of work that goes into the cd and it reflects in his singing
proably one of the best cd queen has did since , a night at opera . that and also knowing the fact that this would be queen 's last cd together . i mean , words ca n't begin to describe how good this cd is . inneundo is like one musical painting . with songs like `` deliah , bijou '' and the title track itself , `` innuendo '' that just inspire the imagination and the soul . but , it also has some very moving tracks too , `` the show must go on '' and `` these are the days of our lives '' . that are so wonderful . innuendo is a great cd and is most defantly worth listening to .
there have n't really been many acts these past few years that really have been more about image than the feeling or uniqueness of great pop music . one of the most surprising acts these past few years is definitely weezer . they have really brought up a great deal with the feel of geek rock , and their latest single really does connect with everybody . their latest track beverly hills is a great pop song . it is very upbeat and easily catchy . i like this song because it is very different and very vivid . rivers cuomo and company have really got a lot into good music right now . hopefully , they can keep it up with their next single . song : b 1/2+
this installment , like the rest of this series so far , is suspenseful , funny and populated with characters that seem very real . one new character , laura fielding , is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband , and is , in general , a very likable character ( and one that charms both stephen and jack ) . the middle eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described . stephen 's adventures in his new scientific marvel , the diving bell , are both funny and interesting . jack 's encounters with laura 's massive dog ponto are hilarious . the end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved . the most notable thing about this book is what a great job o'brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations , characters and situations . o'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition . the only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and o'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books
this is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics . there is some clumsiness to it -- the use of flashbacks towards the end does n't work . they seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy , exciting pace it is in the final movie , and to add a little of that during the final part , which after horn is arrested moves at a slower pace . but the movie is still well-made , well-acted , and plenty entertaining . this is a revisionist western that does n't downplay -- well , does n't downplay excessively -- horn 's stature as a killer of men . in the movie , horn is n't reluctant to fire the first shot , or to keep shooting after a man is down . when one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town , for example , horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud , probably mortally wounded , horn unnecessarily shoots him again . in the film , it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out . horn comes off as something of a hapless , easily-manipulated rube in the movie -- which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was . he 's an idiot savant , of sorts , a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people , but inept at living in the civilized world . when he learns that he is being accused of killing the nickell boy , not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence , he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself . we remain sympathetic to horn , though . when we see him kill , he 's always killing men much , much worse than himself . the world is not a worse place for their departure . and he 's a helluva shot . we americans love a great shot
as a serious and productive translator and social researcher for many years , i want to translate this book into chinese . please convey my suggesion and desire to the authors . it would not be too difficult to find a local publisher here for cooperation . i have also read other writings by the same author <NUM> years ago ... thank you
when i started listening to pompougnac i fell in love with the music . some of my friends told me to start with number <NUM> , i bough 3,4,5,6 , and <NUM> the same day ... thank god because number <NUM> was the one i liked the least ... do n't get me wrong it is a beautiful cd and the songs are great but not the best of them ... <NUM> and <NUM> are the best for me so i recomend to start with number <NUM> then <NUM> and then any of them .... i have the whole hotel costes collection and it is just amazing . stephane is a genius ...
miss silverman is the most recent addition to the group of `` meta-bigot '' comedians -- i.e . comics who tell ethnic jokes supposedly for their `` shock '' value , while hiding behind a screen of supposed irony -- which includes dave chappelle , carlos mencia , chris rock , and the writers of south park . i find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the `` n '' word so much . i think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive , female and jewish . if larry the cable guy ever said the `` n '' word on a comedy dvd , i guarantee you that al sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick . keep in mind that silverman has been dating jimmy kimmel of `` the man show '' fame for many years . though i am a female , i did truly enjoy the man show , though i thought it was n't as ironic as many people would have you believe . anti-pc `` irony '' is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves , and do n't have the gonads to do so in public . anyone who can appreciate humor knows there 's a difference between comedy and hate , but many are so sensitive that they ca n't tell the difference .
my <NUM> yr old is special needs and we use this book as one of our activities . the book covers counting , colors , and so much more . things are color coded and stickers are seperated according to the section of the book they apply to . it allows for success even in children who would have a harder time . my son even tries to match the angle of the sticker with the colored shadow he is placing it on . it allows for a lot of practice with pragmatic speech . i can ask questions very easily , and he tries to answer based on what is in front of him . he gets very excited when he has finished a whole page . he attends very well with this book . i recommend it to everyone
i noticed it 's been over two years since this volume has had a new review but that is understandable considering the age of this music however it is still fun to hear this material again and during the late 60s and most of the 70s i listened to music on the radio more than i have my entire life and that is the reason these earlier volumes of the h.a.n.d . series bring back so many pleasant memories for me . wls , waky , & wklo were my favorite 60s & 70s am radio stations and they played most of these songs regularly when these tunes were on the charts and it 's nice to still be able to listen to them in this new century . does nostalgia play a role for me ? ..... definitely ! ..... and even though this volume <NUM> is evidently out of print ; it is still a good one . as a matter of fact ; i think it is one of the best of this series of <NUM> being below only volumes <NUM> & <NUM> . a few previous reviewers have spoke highly of it and a few have spoke of it as being one of the weaker ones ; then again ( as i 've said before ) it all depends on your taste for these old songs and there are several tunes on this volume that suits my taste . two of them are daddy dewdrop 's , chick-a-boom ( do n't ya jes ' love it ) , and jerry reed 's crossover hit , when you 're hot , you 're hot . both are very upbeat & halarious . one of my favorite 70s bands was hamilton , joe frank and reynolds and they are also here with , do n't pull your love . murray head 's , superstar , is a tune i had n't heard in <NUM> + years and sounds great and chase 's , get it on , ( not to be confused with t.rex 's , bang a gong ; get it on ) is a fantastic rocker . although i like the beatles abbey road version better ; richie havens version of , here comes the sun , also brings back fond memories . another talented artist on this volume is lobo singing one of his big hits being , me and you and a dog named boo . mike curb congregation 's , burning bridges , is a good tune i probably have n't heard since it dropped off the charts back then . 60s legends ; tommy james , and the raiders are also here with their huge hits ; the top <NUM> , draggin ' the line , and the # <NUM> smash , indian reservation , ( in that order ) and speaking of 60s legends ..... the fortunes are also here with the stellar , here comes that rainy day feeling again , and that song is the standout on this disc ..... whew ! ..... volume <NUM> ; a weaker version ? ..... not to me ! this is an out of print ( but strong ) volume . have a nice day ; volume <NUM> = <NUM> 1/2 stars
deffenitly one of the best movies ever made in horror . the plot was deep and it itroduced the world into the best horror icon there is . unlike others ( freddy ) pinhead had not changed his attitude . loads of gore and people getting ripped apart . they even have a few sex scenesthrown in their . clive barker really knew what he was doing when he mad this movie . go out and get this no or you will be sorry you did n't cuz this is a classic .
`` hey hey mama , said the way you move , gon na make you sweat gon na mak you groove ... '' is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one . i can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a led zepplin song . to create a song with the charge of `` rock and roll '' , or the lyrics to `` battle of evermore '' , to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me ; and as for `` stairway '' i think that 's beyond any of us mortals . the popular `` stairway '' had a seemingly unreal start when one day robert plant had a pencil and paper and jimmy page was just strumming when plant described it as `` my hand just started writing out the words . i just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat . '' the song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in american history , which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single . but it is not just a zepplin cd with `` stairway '' on it . it is has so much to offer in every track . i have grown up with these songs , and if you 've ever seen a ford commercial or just listened to the radio , chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you do n't know who led zepplin is . but the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of `` stairway '' is `` when the levee breaks '' . i always personally found `` levee '' as the strongest song in zoso ; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber . but `` levee '' brings this epic album to an extraordinary close . after every listen , i find it hard to believe that there is only eight tracks , because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery , and after you have listened to zoso whether it be the first time or if it 's been too many to count , it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special , done by a band with a sound that is larger than life . essential recording . no exceptions
i have purchased both awakened mind system discs ( original and 2.0 ) and both are amazing . they have taken my meditations to a whole new level . they are also great for power napping or doing creative work . i feel that the awakened mind system discs are better than many of thompson 's other discs for two reasons . first , ams uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies ( beta , alpha , theta , delta ) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized , peaceful and creative , dreamy and focused , all at once . this makes ams useful for many different activities . second , they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract . many of thompson 's other discs , including the theta meditation system , use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating . if you 're looking for music to deepen your meditation , enhance your mental functioning , or even help you sleep , try the awakened mind system
i just actually finished reading this book yesterday . it was given to me by my counselor , to whom i seem to talk to quite often about my son 's behavior and how frustrating it is to me . i was amazed with each new section of this book at how many of these behaviors are caused by temperment . i 've been told in that past that my son ( <NUM> years old ) has a difficult temperment , but i never really `` got it '' until i read this book . i did n't realize that a lot of what goes on is n't even in his control a lot of the time .... that 's just how his temperment causes him to act or react . i could n't believe how much of this book `` hit the nail on the head '' as i was reading it . it really made me feel like there may just be something i can do about my son 's difficult behaviors and his attitude and `` freshness '' . i ca n't wait to try all of the suggestions that stanley turecki gives . i can finally now see that things my son did even as a small toddler relate to all of his tempermental issues and that i am not being a `` bad '' mom like i 've so often felt i was . i highly recommend this book to any parent of a hard-to-raise and hard to understand child . you 'll surely walk away with some enlightenment and some great tools to help you with your child and also to help your child to better his/herself .
ronald l.davis ' study of the beautiful 'fox girl ' , linda darnell is one written with great kindness and respect to this most wonderful lady . this book does not delve into the trash and gossip that often is cruelly and unnecessarily found in film star biographies . davis looks at linda with a caring pen and writes about her fairly . although he writes about her personal troubles he does so gently with heart and understanding . he spent many hours interviewing her daughter charlotte , her sisters undeen and monte , her brother cal and numerous friends . this helps to give the book a personal feel that is not found in those written from archives and second hand news . i adored linda before reading this book and when i finished he cemented my adoration of the lady forever
insight ( mindfulness ) meditation - the vipassana meditation of theravada buddhism - can change your life whether you are buddhist or not , and this is one of three books that can take you there . to get acquainted with this excellent meditation method and for lots of inspiration to try it , start with `` wherever you go , there you are '' by jon kabat-zinn . then , to learn more about just how to do it , move on to `` mindfulness in plain english '' by henepola gunaratana . now you 're ready for the big leagues of mindfulness - larry rosenberg 's outstanding book , `` breath by breath : the liberating practice of insight meditation '' . he takes the potentially complex topic of how to do this meditation just as the buddha taught it , and explains the entire anapanasati ( mindfulness with breathing ) method in a way that westerners can understand and relate to . i 've practiced insight meditation for more than a decade , and have accumulated a pretty good library of books on buddhism and on meditation . larry rosenberg 's book - which i 've read and re-appreciated several times - is one of the last ones i 'd be willing to part with
i just saw this on comedy central today and laughed so hard i cried ! ! and i was sick with a cold and flu , too , but it was so good that , after it was over , my husband and i went out shopping to try and find a copy to buy so that we could see it without the editing and commercials . found a copy to rent , but it 's so good i want my own copy to keep ! could n't find it anywhere to buy today , so i 'm ordering it from amazon now and thought i 'd put in my two cents about how great it is . kirsten dunst and michelle williams are too priceless as the 15-year-old best friends who stumble unwittingly into the watergate mess in <NUM> . they are befriended by tricky dick , who gives them jobs as offical white house dog walkers of his famous dog `` checkers '' in an attempt to please them so they wo n't talk about what they 've seen ( they do n't know what they witnessed anyway , which is what makes it so funny ) . the entire cast is first rate and i have n't laughed this hard at a new comedy ( new for me , i mean ) since i first saw `` me , myself & irene '' . this movie is n't nearly as crude in humor as the latter , but as far as the writing and the comedic talents of the fantastic cast , it ranks right up there with any of the funniest movies i 've ever seen . sure to put you in a great mood ! : ) : ) the simplistic premise of the movie could have made it go either way ( either really great or really awful ) , but these actors made it fantastic to watch and must have certainly had a blast filming it . i do n't know if the dvd has outtakes but i hope so ; i bet they would be hilarious to see . i was holding my breath the last few seconds as i waited for the ending , hoping it was going to be worthy of the rest of the film , and was not dissapointed . laughed my b * * t off at the ending ! ! give it a watch ; if you love to laugh , and especially if you were a dreamy teenage girl in the <NUM> 's who covered her bedroom walls with posters of bobby sherman and david cassidy ( like i did ! ) , you 'll love this movie . it 's not just for 40-something gals , either ; my 50-year-old husband laughed himself silly too ! !
i 'm writing this out of frustration . i saw the ending twice on hbo - free week-end - liked what i saw so decided to order from amazon . the only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that i have yet to figure out how to open . there is a red plastic piece on the right side . it can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open . i tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked . those discs are inside for good . i 'm going to best buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab . obviously i 'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened . but , as i said before , what i did get to see of the movie , ( the last half hour ) on hbo . . . i liked . a slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie , was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today
i have always been a big fan of bette midler , goldie hawn and diane keaton , i bought the picture when it first came out on vhs . i think i viewed it to many times because the picture and sound quality began to fade , thus i looked all over the country side for the dvd version to no avail , so i decided to order it from amazon.com only to find it on the shelf at target a few weeks later but i do n't regret my purchase , thanks guys . i 'm sure i will enjoy it for many years to come . it 's such a funny and dramatic picture
this movie takes you away for <NUM> minutes into the arms of someone who can deliver a line so effortlessly you forget he is an actor . he and miss graham are a delighful odd couple and miss driver , trying to find a place to smoke in america , is perfect british allure . if you are a colin firth fan , it is worth every penny
i 've been a fan of meatloaf since his album `` bat of hell '' . i like the dramatic use of orchestral and backgound vocals . i think that meatloft 's voice is so powerful , and these songs prove that . this is by far the best album of meatloaf 's performances . this album along with `` bat out of hell '' , and `` bat out of hell ii '' is all that you need for your collection of meatloaf . this is a great career retrospective album
disc <NUM> . buskers who have been together long enough to tighten up , play inside each others ' moves , and develop a distinctive style all their own-dusty folk songs about a hard life they love . subdudes come to mind . they document life on the road , in a beloved australia , and their personal lives in up-close personal terms . striking phrases of lyrics repeatedly grab my attention . they fans love them and they love entertaining them . disc <NUM> is a revelation . [ 72:04 ] disc <NUM> offers more of the same . maybe too much of a good thing all at once-the distinctive style gets a little claustrophobic . and yet , i want to hear more . watch for last track .

i had always had a semi-interest in buddhism , derived from ecstatic readings of 'dharma bums ' by jack kerouac ( another must-have ) , but disappointed as i couldnt find 'big sur ' at the bookstore a month ago , i chanced upon the religion section , and zen keys shone out on the shelf , i picked it up , read a page of thich nhat hanh 's contemplative prose , and immmediately bought and took it home devouring it in my bedroom for hours . nhat hanhs compassionate and understanding approach to zen buddhism makes learning about it easy , and also very rewarding . his take , which is no ones take at all but rather the truth , about zen makes for free-minded thinking thru the eight negations , mindfullness of everyday life , and the wisdom of the zen masters in the kung-ans at the end of the book . i can not help but be forever changed by this simplistic yet beautiful overlay of zen buddhism . anyone , everyone , americans and materialism and all , must read this , dont lose your life in forgetfullness and apathy and be lost in worldly pursuit , be a monk
not surprisingly t-rez comes up wit another great sounding album . i swear the only way to listen to this is loud very very loud ! its very noisy but great at the same time cant wait for pt.2 but i think its going to be a movie , who knows
`` customer culture '' has some very profound and powerful insights into how an to get the employees in a business to unite around providing excellent service . `` customer culture '' provides a framework for building a customer oriented business culture . i consider `` customer culture '' to be one of the most valuable business books i have ever read
great sound great performance , pity there were no other hard to find jems besides `` start me up
this movie made me laugh and the day i saw it i needed that laugh . parts of the plot are predictable but it still `` works '' . it is a pg13 but most adults will enjoy this movie at least the young at heart types . there have been several movies with a similar plot but this one is a head above the rest
buy this cd . the songs are excellent , as per usual . this cd is more rock , with the same enjoyable dispostion ... to quote from track <NUM> , decatur st. `` i 'm one of them sad boys who 's hypnotized by girl 's who walk the walk ... '' or track <NUM> the killer .... `` i want you to burn me til i feel it ... '' ... need one say more
i would n't recommend this to anyone who thinks that religious wars , repression of individual spirits or rape of the earth are good things . those who seek peace , harmony , celebration of each of us and respect for our earth will find this hopeful
finally , a reference book that offers its users more sophisticated word choices in a format that makes such inherent sense ! peter meltzer 's book stands out in the way that he differentiates his thesaurus from other , heretofore , conventional ones . the rogets of the world , as meltzer states , `` start out with the premise that the user already knows the synonyms , '' and their guidebooks merely help to `` jog his or her memory . '' meltzer 's book provides its users with new , sophisticated synonyms which , importantly , are neither archaic nor obsolete . in fact , nearly every synonym is followed by an example of its usage that is taken from actual articles or books , which is fascinating . additionally , meltzer offers what he calls `` clarifiers '' to <NUM> % of his entries . these clarifiers amplify the single word you may be seeking . for example , there are seven uses for `` unusual , '' each with its own specific synonym that more aptly describes `` unusual '' , as in unusual/unconventional , unusual/supernatural , unusual/person , etc . do n't expect to find the simple synonyms that you 're used to seeing in other thesauri . meltzer gives you the benefit of the doubt that you already know those words and offers you a more exciting , more intelligent way to shape your vocabulary . regardless of your writing needs , this book is a must-have . i enjoyed reading the introduction , it gave me a strong sense of the book 's layout and reminded me why a thesaurus is not just for writing college term papers
as a completist gram fan since <NUM> , the alternate versions of we 'll sweep out the ashes , streets of baltimore , and hickory wind are truly otherworldly . well worth the price , in and of themselves
i 've always enjoyed shep fields orchestra . this cd is an excellent review of the music heard back in the early 40's.vocalist hal derwin 's liner notes tell the whole story of the fields band.some remarkably good accordion work by caesar muzzioli with this band . worthwhile listening
four years ago i was completely smitten with noll 's jung cult and the many facinating threads to follow from the book 's many descriptions of cults , personages and movements at the time of the fin de siecle . i thought noll truly brilliant . this past year i followed one of those threads from noll to sonu shamdasani 's cult fiction . reading the two led me to a lesson in scholarly research and withholding judgement . i could have founded a noll cult after reading his writing . i learned to question it more objectively reading shamdasani . the two do a great tango and i have found it of essence to read them both . i do n't know and find it ridiculous to say they hate each other -- hey they sell each others ' books and i am a different thinker and jung adept after reading both authors . noll is rich with references and associations -- sonu questions very thoroughly and almost without flaw noll 's argument . shamdasani does grip noll 's hamstring but the joy of reading the jung cult for me is n't flagged -- only changed in the sense of i am glad i got past noll to read sonu
i love these practices ! they go so well with the longer yoga conditioning for weight loss . the a.m practice is my particular favorite , it really gets me going , i do it almost everyday , in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon . if i 'm particulary rushed , i might repeat the a.m. practice , i like it so much . the p.m is pretty good , too ; i get to sleep quicker when i do it .
one of the greatest teen movies of all times . if you were in high school during the 80s , you 've seen it . the movie is real , funny and a timeless classic . i must admit there is a bit of a lull about 3/4 through , after the abortion , but other than that the movie is perfect . if you have n't seen it lately , check it out and you 'll start to remember high school again like it was yesterday . need more - check out the book .
whitley combines dissonant electric guitar with acoustic and his songwriting style is uniquely his own . & quot ; automatic & quot ; is the best thing here , but you ca n't go wrong on any of the others . i prefer this more full-bodied work to his other stripped down acoustic affairs , & quot ; living with the law & quot ; and & quot ; dirt floor & quot ;
just to make things clear , i 've never owned any prince albums , and therefore ca n't consider myself a fan . most people seem to judge these songs by comparison to his other work , but i 'm speaking from a completely neutral point of view when i say : this album is great ! i remember i bought this back in the early 90s thinking it was danny elfman 's score to the film , and returned it when i realized it was actually a soundtrack by prince . so , over a decade later , when i read that jack nicholson himself supported the use of prince 's talent for some of the movie 's music , i figured why not give it a shot ? i figured right ! all nine tracks have their own style and place , but the best ones are full of dance-able funk and hook , like `` the future '' , `` electric chair '' , `` partyman '' , `` trust '' , and `` batdance '' ( you got ta dig that breakdown ) . it has that feel-good electronic goove that 's the epitome of <NUM> 's pop music . and as a nice little touch , there are several songs that use audio clips from the film ( namely nicholson 's napier/joker character ) that really keep the bat-atmosphere alive . i 've long been a fan of gotham 's characters as well as jack nicholson , and now , through this , i think prince may hold a spot on my list . basically said , `` batman '' the soundtrack is a must for anyone who loved the movie
this is a ridiculous price . i would have bought this long ago , but the price just stays at that ridiculous price . i have n't seen the film in years , and would really love to watch it again . but for this price , that 's nuts . i paid less for some film collections . what in the world is criterion doing by asking for so much money for this ?
it 's a great day for da hood . i loved all three of em but unfortunately only own friday
i have my degree in english ... i like reading and teaching with this version as `` help '' not as a substitution . it gives a clearer understanding to shakespeare for people who have difficulty with it .
if you love mozart you will really enjoy this cd . in my opinion sir neville marriner & the academy of st. martin in the fields performs mozart better than any other . the only problem i have with this cd is some tracks on the first cd are recorded live . i have never been a big fan of live recordings . an occasional cough is heard on track <NUM> which makes me cringe . if only they passed out cough drops that evening i would have awarded this cd five stars . otherwise the music is simply sublime . robitussin anyone
this is my first full-blown experience with virginia woolfe . i was always a bit too impatient , skimming over paragraphs of internal dialog to get to the plot . what a difference an amazing narrator makes ! yes , it is slow going at times , but the beauty of woolfe 's sentences make the focus on every word worthwhile . leishman treats woolfe 's words as poetry , and i started thinking of them as that . for that reason , i disagree with the reviewer counseled against ten minute spurts -- at least in the audio version , the prose seemed so rich that it was hard to absorb more than a few minutes at a time . it was only when i began to savor each paragraph on its own that i could truly enjoy this work . this book is truly profound . it has caused me to become more aware of my own inner life , and has changed the way i think about what it means to `` know '' another person . highly , highly recommended -- and this is from someone who spends a lot of time reading trashy chick lit and thrillers !
this under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from woolf critics ... but i would say that , since i wrote my dissertation on it ! woolf 's fiction is never light reading , but woolf lovers will here find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power , her exhaustive knowledge of english history and literature , her feminism , her passionate hatred of war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity to question the status quo and * perhaps * create a better world ... interested readers might consider reading it alongside the years , three guineas , moments of being , the last volumes of the diary , or such woolf essays as & quot ; thoughts on peace during an air raid , & quot ; as well as shakespeare 's tempest . this slim novel speaks volumes ; it is a work of mature genius by one of the 20th century 's greatest writers
these guys are the best group out right now . every single rapper is amazing even bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics . this album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including sh * t can happen , pistol pistol , ai n't nuttin ' but music , american psycho , fight music & revelation . my favorite rappers are swifty & eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now ( besides em , only proof ( r.i.p . ) & bizarre do ... which are my least favorite rappers in the group ) every song is great even the skits are enjoyable . if you do n't have this yet , you are missing out on one of the best cds ever
great book to use in the classroom . beautiful illustrations . i have done a lot with klimt in the classroom and this book will really help the young children enjoy him even more . and maybe inpsire lots of their own masterpieces
all the enchanted forest chronicles are so much fun ! definitely at my top of harry potter fan recommendations . they 're just such an amusing read ; i even teach with them . do n't forget to read `` the frying pan of doom .
it 's no box set and therefore ( inevitably ) excludes some tunes i would n't have , but this is a good sampler of tom scott 's 70s & quot ; heydays , & quot ; including the crank-it-up & quot ; gotcha & quot ; ( starsky & amp ; hutch tv theme song ) and soulful & quot ; shadows , & quot ; among others . i was disappointed more from & quot ; blow it out & quot ; was n't included , but overall it 's a good ( not great ) single album 's worth of tom scott . if you like 70s fusion ( for lack of a better term ) , you should like this . certainly worth $ ..
one of the most notorious espionage stories of the 20th century involves several members of britain 's upper crust . while anthony blunt , guy burgess , kim philby , and donald maclean attended trinity college , cambridge , in the 1930s , they were recruited as spies by the soviet government . all of the men subsequently gained prestigious jobs and successfully passed secrets to the russians for several decades . the four-hour television mini-series , & quot ; cambridge spies & quot ; , concentrates on the characters of the spies , and how the society they were part of allowed them to flourish . the film begins with trinity college , cambridge in the 1930s . hitler 's power is on the rise , and fascism manages to impress a certain segment of the british upper classes . in response to the rise of fascism , many are attracted to communism . blunt and burgess are members of an elite club -- the apostles -- and they are both committed communists when they meet and become involved with donald maclean and kim philby . the four men form a tight bond , which remains even after they leave university . philby and burgess both held high positions in mi6 , and maclean became a diplomat . blunt -- a distant relative to the royals -- was knighted and became the royal curator of art for the queen . & quot ; cambridge spies & quot ; succeeds in showing how these men were attracted to communism in the first place . they all came from wealthy , privileged backgrounds , and involvement with communism was a reaction against that , and also a reaction against fascism . the film shows the political and social atmosphere in which the & quot ; cambridge spies & quot ; made their commitment to communism . the film is also extremely successful in showing the 'old boy network ' that existed , and which , in effect managed to protect the spies . they were simply beyond suspicion and beyond reproach . guy burgess ( tom hollander in an amazing performance ) is a volatile extrovert with a penchant for self-destruction . kim philby ( toby stephens ) is much more controlled , and he seems the more rational of the bunch . maclean ( rupert penry-jones ) is another loose cannon , and blunt ( samuel west ) enjoys his connection with his royal relatives far more than he anticipated . while i deplored the misguided actions of the spies , it seems quite plausible that at least two of the four men ( blunt and burgess ) lived to really regret their youthful decision to convert to communism . but they found themselves stuck in a lifetime commitment before they realised the consequences . blunt and burgess seemed to truly love england , and their involvement with the soviet government is sadly ironic . & quot ; cambridge spies & quot ; is really is an incredible story . the plot sticks more or less to the truth -- although some details are not quite accurate . the most glaring deviation concerns the defection of guy burgess . dvd extras include a documentary , and there 's also a 'scrapbook ' with tv tidbits about each of the spies -- displacedhuman
this album good . me like very much.if you no like it , go f * * * yourself . if you no like it , you suck more then me english . actually , my english is not bad at all . this album is great . the beat can be memorized until doomsday and eminem kicked a * * . but bizzare stunk , except he was pretty good on one track . but bizzare 's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album . go buy this album now . when you hear it , you will go crazy over it . if you do n't , the devil is ready to welcome you into hell .
victor hugo 's novel has been filmed so many times , with excellent actors donning the hump : lon chaney , anthony quinn , and anthony hopkins are a few examples that spring to mind . however , the crude 'animalistic ' behaviour and the pathos that charles laughton brings to his performance is wonderful , for at no time can the audience feel any sentiment for this quasimodo . he is a horror with a human soul . while cedric hardwicke is a horror that pretends to have a soul . it is very easy to enthuse and celebrate the film , simply because it is wonderful to watch for its sets and , therefore , its art direction , photography , and design . the reason it was not heaped with oscars is simple : it is one of the 'great films ' of <NUM> . let us go back to the actors . cedric hardwicke has never been as smooth a villain , he is as frollo is evil . maureen o'hara in her first film may not be the ideal for a gypsy maid , but she does show what would become her strengths : independence from , and yet a dependence for men ... edmond o'brien as pierre shows his great talent ( probably one of the best screen actors ever , he played a different person in each role , you could not type cast him ) . thomas mitchell as the king of thieves is smart and in this film extremely dangerous . another thing that the production did with understated talent was show a europe moving from medieval to renassiance existence . if there is a fault with this film : it is simple . it has a happy ending .
this book is one of the only works that addresses the topic of ecological design in an in-depth manner . moreover , it focuses on the progenitors of this movement - the design outlaws that had the courage to forge entirely new and radical paths in art , design , science and technology . powerful stuff - important message - innovative and engaging subject matter
i really loved this cd . i am not normally a fan of classical music , but this is more like a pop cd . andrea 's duets are absolutely fabulous . you forget you are listening to what is classified as classical . it is very enjoyable & i suggest all andrea fans get this one , but they probably already have . hopefully with this cd , andrea 's music will be introduced to people who are pop fans & they will start to buy his music & become a fan , as i have
burrell ( g ) coltrane ( ts ) tommy flanagan ( p ) paul chambers ( b ) jimmy cobb ( d ) 3/7/58 . trane was in his `` sheets of sound '' period at this time , and he and burrell make a good pair . freight train is an up-tempo blues that is excellent ; another blues on the cd is big paul , which at 14-minutes is just a tad too long . never knew and lyresto , both taken medium-up , are also very good . flanagan is his usual impeccable self . excellent early work by all the musicians involved
spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters . just when you think grisham ca n't do it again , he does it anyway
louis armstrong has one of those voices that no matter what you are doing , when you hear him sing , you know its him . the distinctiveness and depth of his voice is undeniable . it is a good thing this is a cd and not an album , because it would be worn out by now if it were an album
i am in the infant stages of my conversion to judaism , and this book really cemented my conviction that this is the right decision for me . i felt that rabbi kushner clearly explained what judaism is all about to him and , in many instances , to me as well . the chapter dealing with the dietary laws i found particularly helpful and enlightening , as this is one of the most intimidating factors for me in converting to judaism and living as an observant jew . rabbi kushner 's explanations helped me understand the dietary laws in a different way , as allowing the sacred to enter into mealtimes -- which takes the focus off food -- and i immediately began `` keeping kosher '' to an extent . i did n't feel that this book slammed christianity , but i 'm not a christian so my perspective is decidedly one-sided . i did feel that this is a book about judaism , not about christianity . there are places where rabbi kushner compares and contrasts the two religions , but i did n't get the sense that he was saying , `` our way is better than your way . '' i did get the sense that he is a man who feels deeply connected to god , and sees his religion as the source of that connection . while it 's likely that a ( relatively ) small number christians would read this book , it seems to be intended for jews -- a book for jews about judaism , written by a jew . the references to christianity did not seem to be an instruction guide on christianity so much as a way for jews to understand their own religion within the context of modern american society , which is predominantly christian . if you are interested in learning more about judaism -- what do jews believe ? what is the jewish religion all about ? -- then i think this is a very good introduction . rabbi kushner 's explanations are easy to read and understand and at the same time very enlightening . do n't let this be the extent of your studies into judaism , but it is a fine place to start
i read the book , but the movie really brings home what the story meant . truly amazing and heart wrenching - you will cry for ishi , you will cry for all the native americans . truly a must see ! you will not be disappointed . greene does another remarkable job
this is a great dvd , alot of xtra feature.i think of all make up effex this is the best + love the soundtrack ! ! of all versions out their this is the one you should buy . get city of the living dead and the beyond will your their , you wont be disapointed ! ! lucie fulci , we miss you
larson 's last two efforts ( watercolor sky , sepia ) were both outstanding , polished albums with hank linderman at the helm . this album is more `` raw '' and stripped down in style . more of jeff 's contemporary edge comes through on two part confessional , as if linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes . `` looking at december '' has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before . `` maybe cascade idaho '' fully has that beach boys/brian wilson sound jeffery foskett brings to the table and as such , more of a foskett than linderman sound . `` a better day '' sounds more like an america song than gerry beckley has done in decades , and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals , it really bears his presence well . `` the way outside '' recalls <NUM> eagles/walsh/fogelberg ballads , which linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style . `` play through '' has a aaa radio sound to it , with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar , drums & bass . `` only green '' is a beautiful ballad ( i.e . souveniers ) , and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of bruce gaitsch ( richard marx , timothy schmit ) on some of his solo work . a surprise addition comes after the end , as a short instrumental ensues , no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor . all in all a very satisfying group of songs , not a bad one in the lot , which i find amazing in today 's music .
rosanne cash 's meditation of the loss of life and love ( her father , johnny ; her stepmother , june carter cash ; and her mother , vivian cash distin ) is her darkest album since the divorce chronicle of `` interiors . '' she calls into question both god and herself on such songs as `` house on the lake '' and the title track . like some of emmylou harris ' best work ( like the recent `` red dirt girl '' ) , rosanne has moved to the far fringe of country and given her music an both a dose of intelligence atmospheric edge . you wo n't find any lighthearted 'redneck girl ' stompers here . in fact , `` radio operator '' is probably the closest thing to a generic country song on `` black cadillac . '' this is a good thing . cash refuses to bend to anyone 's rules ( much like she has on some of her other great records and `` rules of travel ) . she delivers both her grief and her resolve simply and elegantly on `` dreams are not my home '' and gives a reality check face slap to bickering lawyers on `` like fugitives '' and a reaffirmation of life/faith on `` god is in the roses . '' to say that `` black cadillac '' is merely a tribute to her lost family members is selling the cd short . rosanne is , like the dixie chicks , slaid cleaves , emmylou harris or even her father 's `` american music '' series , making country music for thoughtful adults
i was introduced to william willimon through his sermons . he is a genius preacher and a prolific writer , having published hundreds of sermons and dozens of books . the insights in pastor are the fruit of a life long lived in god 's service . it is not easy being a pastor amidst the cultural mega-shifts underway . many of us find ourselves in the throws of a vocational identity crisis . what in the world are pastors to give themselves to ? are they primarily preachers , chief executive officers , ones who empower the laity , counsellors in the clinical vane or spiritual directors in the catholic tradition ? drawing from a deep well of theological and historical insight , as well as years of pastoral experience , willimon tackles these and other questions arranged in thirteen well-crafted chapters covering the full spectrum of pastoral theology . pastor balances theory and practice , and is full of real-life examples from willimon 's own experience . one example is the way he comes against the individualist spirit of north american christianity , and calls for pastors to see themselves as participants with all of god 's people in transformative communities of faith and not merely as religious managers . i only wish that i had this resource twenty years ago .
this is the last really good album that lou reed made in <NUM> . he captures the feel of his new york and you can visualise what the dirty boulevard looks like . lou is at his best when he plays tough and on new york his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot . for velvet 's fans , im going to rate this 3rd of lou 's solo efforts behind transformer and take no prisoners
very good movie - fantastic lead dancer . music is good but a mix and not all danceable . all in all good movie & good soundtrack .

i have an interest in all environmental solutions , but from a more technical side and i was searching for an economical mode of transport , which could also be an ongoing project for the future months . `` convert it '' is a great read and it really shows you the basic rules and tips in both technical detail but in a user friendly layout . i would recommend it as a great starting block and as an essential library piece for any future electric car-converting enthusiast
living on the ragged edge is a commentary on the old testament book of ecclesiastes . this was a life-changing book for me in <NUM> . my whole life had literally collapsed right in front of my eyes . and i also had a nervous breakdown all in the pursuit of success and graduate school . this book seems to advocate living the `` simple life '' , knowing god , having a wife and kids , not overdoing work or success . i have received alot of abuse the past <NUM> years about why i do n't go back to graduate school ; and the wisdom of this book is part of the reason . i had written to radio havana cuba once and had said that this is a religious book that even fidel castro could appreciate ! i hear that since then he invited to pope to come to cuba to visit . we do live in an insane money-hungry society that has no values , no philosophy , no religion but the pursuit of the `` almight dollar '' ! this ia a major reaqon for why we see american society disintegrating right before out eyes ! it is not deliberate , but i think i see myself as living in the <NUM> 's because of circumstances beyone my control . people in authority try to make my life as miserble as they can so as to pressure me into going back to college-this is called persecution . the amazing thing about our secular achievements is that when we die , we do not get any reward in heaven for them . both solomon in ecclesiastes and jesus christ in the new testament say that we get no reward in the next life for being a successful doctor , lawyer or businessman . jesus said to lay up treasure in heaven-good works like charity towards the poor . also i noticed that it is god who gives man the ability to enjoy life . and contrary to religious tradition in puritalical america , i have found on my electronic bible the advice to `` eat , drink and be merry '' { within moderation , of course . ) the phrase occured five times in ecclesiatstes . god gives the common man and the man who pleases him the ability to enjoy life . the life of the success driven rich man is so full of stress that he may have a fancy meal , yet he can not taste the food he is eating ! you can only live in one house at a time . you can only drive one car at a time . you can only spend so much money in this life because when you die , you wo n't have it any longer . you can have a house full of adult toys and possessions ; yet you are unable to enjoy any of them . i would focus on having a couple of things and being able to use them to the full . solomon spoke from experience . he was the richest man in ancient israel as he was the king . he had all the education a man could want . he had sexual pleasure-a harem of <NUM> wives like the sultan of brunei . he had more horses that he could ride . he had more achievement than he knew what to do with . yet he could n't find satisfaction . his advice was to fear god , obey his commandments and enjoy the simple pleasure of life . he found out that sometimes more is less . in an exotic fashion , i had found out about insight for living while monitoring trans world radio broadcasting from the island monaco to england in <NUM> . they sent me a magazine promoting the book . i bought it and the study guilde and used them both . i have read living on the ragged edge three times since them . this is obviously a message that god wants me to get into my spirit . and this is actually good advice for all of materialistic , worldly america ! another afterthought is this . i do n't think that joining the army is the place to go to find god . but i had managed to get away from my home , family , church and social influences in toledo . i read the bible independantly and did not often attend church . i had found ecclesiastes in the old testament ; yet the message seemed to offend and irritate me at age <NUM> . i think that you may have to go through a few things in life , have a few misfortunes and find a need to look to god for answers in the bible to really appreciate this book and ecclesiastes ! ecclesiastes is a book of godly philosphy ! philosophy=the study of wisdom !
i 've been looking for a book just like this one for years . it has a wide list of movies from westerns to romantic , from la to toledo , from great to dreadful . the detail of the information is very complete and , most important , concise . i think is the best travel guide ever . a real treasure .
my first glimpse of errol morris ' work ( the thin blue line ) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role ( and subsequent fallacy ) of human memory in historical discourse . while `` the thin blue line '' examined a singular texas murder , morris ' `` fog of war '' has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old mcnamara and his position in united states war policy over a thirty year span . world war ii and vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary , but the `` larger footprint '' of morris ' film rests with the controversial nature of mcnamara in the public 's mind versus the historical record . in short , mcnamara bears some responsibility ( and perhaps lingering guilt ) for his recommendations in the wwii bombing and the vietnam policy . the vietnam war was not his action alone , however ; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act : the president of the united states . accordingly , mcnamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition . yet , he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the kennedy/johnson era ( as well as the wwii bombing decisions ) . mcnamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the american public want a criminal confession from the man . with that `` public pitfall '' in mind , mcnamara 's explanations and answers to morris ' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous , but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework . at one point in the film , morris ' essentially asks mcnamara who was responsible for vietnam decisions and mcnamara quickly replies , `` the president '' . the audience ( or at least , i ) wanted mcnamara to answer , `` it was my decision '' and - as such - may view the president response as a cop-out . however , mcnamara is absolutely correct ; the decision for action rested with the commander-in-chief and his name was never robert strange mcnamara . from the audience 's perspective , it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting ( i.e. , not damning ) the two presidents he served and loved . personally , i relished the personal insights morris captured ( or that mcnamara permitted himself to show ? ) . these poignant glimpses ranged from mcnamara 's tearful story of surveying arlington national cemetery for kennedy 's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the mcnamara family during the secretary of defense years . my favorite insight into mcnamara 's soul comes during the retelling of the young quaker who set himself on fire below mcnamara 's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander . while the story is well known , mcnamara pays respect to the widow 's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter . i am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others , but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film . in terms of filmmaking , some reviews have blasted morris ' technique of being off camera and unmiked , his use of the glass soundtrack , or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes , bombing , or protests . in many respects , they are right : either you love morris ' methods or they will grate on you . the editing cuts can be choppy , but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material . if you enjoy a bombastic michael moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric , then `` the fog of war '' may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental . on the other hand , if you enjoyed morris ' earlier `` the thin blue line '' or barbara kopple 's `` harlan county , usa '' and `` american dream '' , then you will want to buy this dvd for the theatrical release , deleted scenes , and mcnamara 's own rules .
dr. alex delaware is invited to take a job on the island of aruk , by the mysterious dr.moreland . shortly into his assigned tasks , alex discovers some very odd cases that the mysterious dr. has treated in the past . one of these cases was a man who claims to have seen `` worm people '' . as dr. delaware tries to unravel these mysterious cases , a brutal murder occurs on the island of aruk . alex inquires of dr. moreland about the islands history , and dr. moreland is very vague in his response . as the climax of this novel approaches , alex finds cryptic messages left for him by the then missing dr. moreland . robin is very much a main character in this story . however , if you are a big fan of milo ( as i am ) , you may be dissapointed because his character plays a minor part in this novel . i give this story <NUM> stars , because it is not one of my favorite kellerman stories . i thought the ending was a little silly
this book covers all the theory and application in an outstanding way without getting too simple or complex . the book is coherent , very well organized , and filled with excellent tables and graphs . great examples as well . i have nothing negative to say about this text
i am very proud to be a korean parent because i read this book . this book explains the suffering of the korean parents all over america . korean children often do not appreciate all the difficulties their parents had to go through to give them the university of california education . many korean parents work in harsh conditions and work long hours and experience all kinds of anti-korean insults by whites . this book explains the pain that korean parents had to go through . it is difficult to explain all my pain to my children . it 's difficult when they are young because i do n't want to burden them . it 's difficult when they are old because it seems petty and they seem to be going through problems of their own . but korean parents suffer in america as immigrants who work hard to reach middle class . this book is great because i can just give to my children to read and they can understand my hardships just by reading about it . i have friends who ca n't even speak english so they ca n't communicate to their children about their experiences . for such a korean parent , this book is ideal . i recommended this book to them
he may not have won the title of american idol , but this country boy can rock ! vehicle is fantastic and in my opinion ( even though i voted for miss underwood to win the competition ) - bo sings 'inside your heaven ' a thousand times better than carrie . the price of this single is so minimal compared to the enjoyment true bo fans will get out of it . do n't pass it up
if any country and western singer has soul and depth in his music , it 's buddy jewell . smooth and emotionally connecting to all country fans . i believe he is the best new c & amp ; w artist in ages and has no where to go but to the top . i highly recommend this album as fantastic
ordinary children , extraordinary teachers has inspired me to be a better parent and teacher to my two children . marva first let the children know that she cared about them and that she would not let them fail even when the other schools have washed their hands of the child . it was as if i were a student in marva 's class . i was so encourage to first , complete the book , i could not put it down , as i read i would practice the techniques on my children , for example my six grade son was still struggling with his multiplcations facts , he had a test to complete <NUM> problems in <NUM> min . i call my son a scholar and had him practice over and over the same test . each practice test he got better and better , he passed the test and felt really proud.he is bringing his c 's to b 's and his b 's to a 's . i learned you have to meet the child where he is . thank you marva for your care , concern , inspiration and motivation . and keep teaching and writing
this is a great historical fiction picture book . the illustrator , p.j . lynch did a marvelous job of creating the characters and scenes for every page . reading this out loud is a perfect way to teach about other countries and peoples . this story would be a first glimpse for some children at immigrant history and what ellis island was all about . with the help of the detailed illustrations , the past comes to life along with the emotional parting and reunions of loved ones .
outstanding sampler from nortern mississippi hill country blues label fat possum . much prefer this sampler to the first one . this has that gritty country blues feel with many songs feeling like they were recorded in a leaky basement ( and many were ) . standouts are the two rl burnside tracks : `` goin down south '' is a staple of his music and the version included of `` walkin blues '' is top notch . the previously unreleased `` i feel good again '' by junior kimbrough and charlie feathers is worth more than the low 4.99 price to buy this . the asie payton tracks are both stunners and paul wine jones and super chikan add some diversity in style with there numbers
this musical is riviting . it lets your imagination run wild . it is something for young and old to enjoy . a must see

i rated this only four stars because the audio track on my dvd was out of sync with the video . it appears that the film to dvd transfer did n't compensate for the film audio being several frames ahead of the images . on the other hand i now have images of the utilidors . i managed to take two backstage tours of walt disney world during the <NUM> 's . the keys to the kingdom tour and the three-park backstage magic tour were expensive and took up an entire day -- but i thought them worth the trouble and expense . it took me three years to book the backstage magic tour , and for several good reasons i did n't get to take home photographs of the backstage areas such as the utilidors . modern marvels provided me video images to keep these vital infrastructure of walt 's utopian village fresh in my mind . i learned about the new expedition everest ride , and how the tree of life was grown by the imagineers . i love the monorail system and the contemporary resort -- featured ! this dvd lets me tour walt disney world and its secrets in the comfort of my home , without flying cross-country and putting up with crowds . it is n't `` the real thing , '' but this dvd allows me to scratch my walt disney world itch until i get the time and a couple of thousand dollars to return to orlando
while i would have preferred dorothy dandridge or lena horne to have payed the titled lead in this interracial romance , produced any released by fox in <NUM> , jeanne crain does an excellent job of portraying `` pinky '' johnson , a mississippi `` colored '' girl , who up north ( boston ) `` passes '' for white and falls in love with white doctor william lundigan , who does a fine job , in a not realized role.3 ethel waters as pinkys ' granmother and ethel barrymore as a family friend do excellent work as do frederick o ' neal , nina mae mckinney , in smaller , but important roles.3 elia kazen , not one of my favorites , for a number of reasons , directed after john ford was taken ill ( actually fired ? ) and had to leave the production , kazen did not care for jeannes ' performance.dudley nichols ( fired because he would not change his downbeat ending ) and phillip dunne ( how green was my valley ) wrote the screenplay . i do n't like to use the term `` colored '' , but thats ' how pinky is repeattedly referred to in the film.maybe <NUM> and 1/2 stars is a better rating , also jeanne and both ethels received aa nominations
it 's hard to believe , but i never heard of wind in the willows until i was about <NUM> years old , when it was first read aloud to me , around a glowing campfire . it was an instant love affair . years later , i shared the classic with my children . so when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor 's tag sale , we snapped it up . we 've loved the film ever since . the animal characters -- badger , mole , toad , weasel and all the others -- congregate often at toad hall and elsewhere , and the story takes many delightful turns . this animated version , directed by dave unwin , is every bit as classic as the book . your children will surely love it as much as we did -- including the child in this particular mom . -- alyssa a. lappe
this book is a must-have for all lennon fans . it has summaries and origins of all his songs from 1970- .it 's full of photos , too ! [ ...
twenty-eight-year-old nan cloutier always thought that , by the time she was twenty-five , she would be living a posh , fabulous life in manhattan , with a great job , an even greater wardrobe , and the guy of her dreams by her side . three years later , and nan still has n't achieved all of the above , and then some . for nan 's so-called `` posh '' job is working for seasonal staffers , inc. a corporation where she has held positions as a cindy-lou who impersonator , easter-egg carrying girl in bunny suit , and valentine 's day purple box of chocolates , among other , much more humiliating titles . which is why nan is desperate enough to tell a little white lie . while posing as cindy-lou who at the merrier-iverson department store christmas display , nan tells her boss - mr. iverson - that she can speak french , and pretends to converse with a french child , reciting her christmas list to the english-speaking grinch . after much praise , nan is beaming from ear to ear , but her smile slowly fades when mr. iverson falls and breaks his leg - the fault of nan , of course . quickly getting canned from her seasonal staffers position , she is offered a new job - by mr. iverson - one that involves baby-sitting his grandson , colm . however , upon meeting , nan quickly realizes that colm is actually her age , and that mr. iverson was actually playing `` matchmaker '' for his grandson , and thinks that the two will make the perfect couple - once they work out a few bumps in the road . i have read many of naomi neale 's ya books - published under the name naomi nash - which is why i was extremely eager to experience one of her adult chick lit books for myself . i was pleasantly surprised , for , from page one , i found nan 's character to be amusing , what with her somewhat ... unusual career choice , and the wisecracks she litters throughout all of her observations on being a seasonal staffer , and life , in general . she is the ideal protagonist and keeps you laughing from beginning to end , while the many bizarre people in her life will take readers by surprise - a pleasant one , of course - and lead them on a trip down lover 's lane . neale has done an amazing job of weaving together a tale filled with smart characters , witty storylines , and an emotional roller coaster to top it all off . nan is a character full of flaws - as well as heart - who will stay with you year-round . erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape
at one time , i was pretty much a sucker for all nu metal that was kinda underground and was n't out for the money . now , i find myself listening to few bands , such as fear factory , type o negative , and machine head . i 've pretty much abandoned all the other guys . so why does switched fit in ? because they pull off emotion in great variety and it 's not simply sounds battering your ears . along with these guys i definitely recommend from zero , who can be compared to these guys except more on the melodic side
this cd has a good sound and variety of their greatest hits . you must be a drifter 's fan to enjoy this one .
this music so so wonderful . it is very high energy and fun . the kids do n't really care that this a `` jazz '' album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy . do n't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as `` kids '' music , get them something you can both enjoy . our favorites are the `` doodle '' song and `` potato chips . '' worth every penny and then some
this is a great film , but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of eastwood 's career . many have said that clint 's film , million dollar baby , was depressing . that film was sad , but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it . this film has nothing like that . the <NUM> boyhood friends , played by penn , robbins , and bacon , have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when penn 's daughter is murdered . after an inital meeting where they all share their grief , the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds . robbins is especially good ( and deserving of his academy award ) as the man who was molested as a young man , and who is permanently scarred because of it . while at first you feel sympathy for penn 's character , you realise slowly that penn is really a cruel , brutal man . bacon is very good as the detective , the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced , even though his wife has left recently , and he is a typically cynical detective . the film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous , dark note , with kevin bacon giving penn a `` i know what kind of person you really are '' at the end of the film . this is a disturbing , brooding film , one of eastwood 's darkest ( even darker than unforgiven ) , but it 's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received . it has the marks of a great tragedy , because like all tragedies , things never worked out for the best , they seemed to have worked out for the worst , but we 're really not sure . great film ....
for those of us who came of age when `` urban cowboy '' introduced john travolta to the world in his third iconic dance-man starring role ( after saturday night fever and grease ) in a productive three-year period , this soundtrack is an essential . we 're all familiar with the big hits that populated this disc and dominated top <NUM> radio in the early '80s , but i 'd buy it solely for the haunting duet by linda ronstadt and j.d . souther , `` hearts against the wind , '' that closes the show
if - and that is a big if ( the book is fully <NUM> pages long - it helps to fall ill when you read it - i did ! ) - you have the time and want to invest it for obtaining a first class overview over the great power play during the decade between <NUM> and <NUM> - the khruschev era - this definitely is the book to read ! its authors not only provide a refreshingly new perspective to the ( more or less well- ) known events of , i.a. , the first israeli-egyptian war , the ( soviet ) occupation of hungary and the cuban missile crisis , they fully succeed in transforming this period of history into a most plausible and very exciting `` story '' , in fact , into something of a `` thriller '' ( in the best sense of the word ) . it is the story of a great power desperate to come up to its claim to possess or at least to be accorded equal status with the other - even greater - super-power , the united states or , more generally , the `` west '' . in order to achieve that one goal , almost anything would do , even extreme brinkmanship that several times brought the world close to thermonuclear war . khrushev is shown as a man to have carried within himself the dominating characteristics of the soviet union itself , viz. , an enormous inferiority complex , trying to combine it with catching any opportunity that would present itself to bring pressure to bear on the other side , even using or better : threatening the use of force , wherever it seemed this might bring political advantage . fortunately for the world , this mercurial leader who disposed of the means to blow up the world ( or at least : great parts of it ) was restrained enough ( be it on his own reason , be it by his more risk-averse colleagues within the presidium ) not to actually let the world go `` over the brink '' but to withdraw each time at the last moment . it is the humiliation of these retreats as well as the sense of responsibility displayed by him in making them which , if anything , ultimately cost him his job and earns him the status of a statesman ( rather than merely that of a cunning politician ) . against this background , only two - very minor - criticisms : first , there is a really unwarranted `` blank space '' in the book as regards the european economic community ( today ` s `` european union '' ) whose very creation was decisively triggered by some of the events described in it ( suez ; hungary ) , by making the european states mercilessly feel their own palsy vis-√†-vis the super-powers . it is ironic - and should clearly have been mentioned in the book - to see how the very institution for whose creation khruschev bore no minor responsibility - would become one of the cornerstones of the west 's economic superiority and thus a decisive factor for the eventual downfall of the soviet empire . second , even though this would admittedly go slightly beyond the clear scope of the book ( khruschev 's cold war , restricting its topic to his role as politician ) , it might have been interesting for the reader to be permitted at least a brief peep behind the veil of this astounding politician 's official role into his private life , if only to underpin/corroborate some of the conclusions regarding this most mercurial character ! this leaves only one thing to be hoped for : at least i , for my part , am dying to read part ii : `` the breshnev years '' , by the same authors , should it ever come out !

i love due and this was no exception . the between is powerful , wonderfully written and extremely creative . in her first novel , due sets the stage for the consequences of what could happen ( both mentally and physically ) if you could change your fate and cheat death . we are introduced to hilton james , whose memories of his beloved grandmother are haunting and confusing ... he sees her dead in their kitchen , only to get help and find her alive and cooking at the stove . years later , he is still troubled by these memories and seeks professional help from his psychiatist/friend . while attempting to salvage his fragile mind , he is overwhelmed with events that change , memories that are not real ( cheating on his wife ) , and events that did not ( in reality it would seem ) occur , his wife , a candidate for a judgeship is being threatened by a racist stalker . ( there also appears to be a connection between hilton 's powers and the stalkers . ) loving his family and wanting what is best for them , he struggles to maintain his hold of reality . in a novel filled with `` parallel worlds , doorways to other dimensions and travelers '' , hilton seems to be scared , confused and lonely . what we later learn is that hilton 's grandmother ( who rescued him from drowning and lost her life ) appears to have suffered from the same type of events ... she too appears to have the ability to cheat death . but as they say in final destination .... you really ca n't cheat death , and that is why the end of the novel is so powerful . in the end , we see hilton once again faced with the option to `` cheat death '' or `` succumb '' and you should read this powerful , well written novel to see what he finally decides .
the guitar intro to riptide is worth the price of this cd alone . lou really shines on egg cream , adventurer , riptide , set the twilight reeling and finish line . the only week song on this collection is hooky wooky . i bought this cd in <NUM> and i ca n't stop listening to it ..... very groovy !
if what i hear is correct , george clooney is making this marvellous book into a movie . joy
underworld is an ambitious book . by examining politics , economics , and popular culture in the united states during the last half of the twentieth century , author don delillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice . in the world that he depicts , people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate . in his opening scene , the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game , where a young man senses `` the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations , the unseen something that haunts the day . '' in other passages of the book , these connections take the form of history or a system : `` that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you . '' the book focuses on nick shay , a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant . it takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation , and this results in a pretty long book : <NUM> pages in the hard cover edition . delillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in nick 's personal transformation , so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry , environmental degradation , and j. edgar hoover . the connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious , and i would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm . also , delillo 's dialogue has a definite style : his characters seem to hoard their words , and an awful lot of them do n't finish their sentences . whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader 's tastes . for me , this is a much better book than delillo 's white noise and libra , which have been widely praised .
dope cd , i liked it , some phat beats and lyrics , everyone does a good job on this cd . didnt like i couple of songs , but apart from that i loved this
this album kicks a * s , if you ca n't handle angus young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p * ssy a * s needs too find music like garth brooks s * it !
what can i say ? i am a guy who likes kate . she has put on weight ( real nice ) and has a more sensual role in this `` flick , '' while remaining her methodic , `` death-dealer '' self . does n't get any better than that for me . sorry ladies , ahh , not really
years ago , in the days before cable , there were six or seven television stations in chicago . only a few of them had programming late at night . there were n't channels to flip between ; when you found a movie you liked , you actually watched it . one weekend night , i came home late and found my sister watching the late-late show on wgn . `` the miracle of morgan 's creek '' had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it . a good sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park . and this movie is as wild a ride as any sturges movie . i have seen this movie a number of times over the last <NUM> years and each time i am almost doubling over with laughter . i ca n't wait to get it on dvd . for a few years in the 1940s preston sturges was a brilliant shinning star . as far as i am concerned , he never shone brighter than he did in this `` miracle . ''
this is a cool video , just from the standpoint of watching jaco pastorius play , however it 's wrong to say that it is a bass instruction video . it 's just two bassists swapping ideas . there is no time spent demonstrating any kinds of technique or style , and the accompanying booklet is pretty useless , as it does n't suggest fingerings , or strings , which is ok for a tune , but pointless for an excercise . the only way you 'll learn from this is to go through it frame by frame and hope you 'll be able to figure out how he 's playing . also not so good from terms of performance , jaco 's not at his best here , and has put a fretted neck on his fretless for demonstartion , but it slows him down in the live jam . all in all , very cool to watch , but do n't expect to learn much , or hear much , kind of like watching a vh-1 interview or something of that ilk . snippets of tunes will get you fired up , but nothing is really explained
i have enjoyed all of the mrs. murphy mysteries , in part because i 'm a cat-and-dog person . the illustrations are a plus , done by people who really know and love animals . outfoxed is written in ms. brown 's easy-to-stay-with style , with lots of commentary from the animals involved . the book may tell more about foxhunting than you might care to know , but rita mae brown makes the human and animal characters so likable that you keep wanting to know what happens to them next . i hope she will give us more books in this style , as well as keeping on in her collaboration with sneaky pie brown in stories about mrs. murphy 's doings
this is a very basic video showing you what you need for a basic sensual dance . i was expecting a little more and the porn at the end was a lil surprising and unneccessary . overall though it does show you a basic dance that you can build from
this is a great movie . this movie has some sexual references , but no nudity . there is some profanity but definitely a funny movie that is geared to older children about <NUM> and up .
i first saw this movie around <NUM> , when the cold war was still on . i had been inundated with propaganda from birth , that all russians talked about was political , that they did n't do `` normal '' things or live a normal life . all politics you know . well , here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women . it was very well acted , and basically , just a long soap ! i loved it -- and not one word about lenin , marx , or anti-americanisms . i recently saw it again , and liked it just as much . for those who say it is unrealistic -- well , how do you know ? do you think that all russians lived the exact same life ? or because american cold war propaganda stated that all russians were totally miserable
this set is great for early film buffs . but , since most of them are in the public domain , they are easily found online at government sites to download free . spending a few hours downloading from the library of congress site , and you will have the same collection
this is a good collection but i think the previous albums are better . there are a couple of nice tracks but you can feel something missing in most of them . all in all a worthwhile buy if you are a big fan , like me ;
the lord of the rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses . many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money , but without the awards and critical recognition of the lotr movies . not so with viggo mortensen . right after lotr he followed with this awesome adventure story by disney . coming out the summer after pirates of the caribbean , this was supposed to be disney 's next big live-action , summer adventure hit . unfortunately , it flopped at the box office . luckily , it has made a comeback on the dvd market , which is where this reviewer saw it . all in all , it is a great movie , and probably one of the best live-action movies disney has produced in a long while ; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com . in short , this movie is about frank hopkins , half-white , half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse . along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the arabian desert for a race . frank takes the challenge with his horse hidalgo and of they go . the race across the arabian desert tests both rider and horse , and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like disney could have created . we have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength , a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence , a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death , a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs , an arrogant prince with no moral bounds , etc , etc ... it all reminds our protagonist of his days in montana ! during the course of the race , which frank and hidalgo win of course ; both of them are tested to the limit . the movie ends on a triumphal note for both . the rider redeems his guilt by freeing hidalgo from human ownership forever , and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals . the soundtrack is awesome , the cinematography is great , the dialogue is realistic , and for once , a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area ! my compliments to disney and the cast and crew of this movie . i highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up
'the medallion ' captures all of the qualities fans of jakie chan know and love , action , supspense , extreme humor , and a touch of mystisism , all the qualities i know and loved in the kid 's wb ! 'jakie chan : adventures ' cartoon series . it has a great cast [ julian sands as the dreaded snakehead , claire forlani as the high kicking interpol agent nicole , lee evens as the bumbling agent watson , and , of course , jakie chan as the chinese super-man eddie yang ] that help give the movie a great energy . the greatest thing about it was it was n't afraid to make fun of itself ! great movie , i hope they make a sequel !
it may be true that dennis swipped his whole repitwar from hicks however dinnis peformance kicks the arse off hicks ..... and surly thats what counts people have this fasination with hicks , thinking hes some kind of profit or god , and although he may have been one of the gratest stand ups ever ..... his performances were at time somwhat lackluster ( exsept for goat boy ) .... any way buy this dvd or ill find out where u live and kill your puppy ..... three cheres for leary and the rediculs views for which he stands
my sister introduced me to richard cheese and i think i busted something laughing at the music/lyric combo . this stuff is hilarious . that said , my baby daughter also digs this music . sadly i am going to need to ditch this cd before she learns to talk or we are going to be in some deep s # @ & t
i 've lived with chronic pain for <NUM> 1/2 years as a result of a car accident which left me with reflex sympathetic dystrophy . this book addresses issues that apply to all kinds of chronic pain . it is practical and easy to understand . i 've bought many , many books on chronic pain , and this is by far the best . i believe this approach to living with chronic pain is realistic , positive and allows the sufferer to make the most of his/her life . the book relates very well to the psychological effects of living with chronic pain . this physical and psychological program allows the sufferer to take back control over his pain and his life . if you or a loved one suffer from chronic pain , this book is a must
the new album `` life in dreaming '' is a spectacular debut from hidden in plain view . definitely one of the best albums of <NUM> so far and will probably be in the top <NUM> of the year . the album is full of catchy hooks , tight riffs , double bass , and the singing is excellent . every song is full of emotion and you can really see some talent in this young band . i would say they sound like a mix between taking back sunday and senses fail . i admit that this album is n't anything new to the scene and they 're very emoish but i think hipv will definitely make a dint in this already overcrowded scene . my only complaint is that the new version of `` twenty below '' is n't as good as it was on their ep , but it 's still good . hipv do n't really bring nething new to the table but their music is heartfelt and is a solid emo/punk record . definitely worth your money .
paris in the <NUM> 's ... and one of the last great musical films from a golden era . you will remember this film well . the teenage leslie caron is stunning
so , what happens is , you 're playin ' with a bunch of nashville dudes , see ? they 're cuttin ' this song , and the big-shot says , & quot ; progression is <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> ... the chorus goes : <NUM> , <NUM> , 6minor - three times ; fourth time , it goes <NUM> , <NUM> , 1. & quot ; what do you do ? you go , & quot ; what key is it in ? & quot ; 'course , you should be able to figure that out by a quick listen , and a tap or two on your guitar ... but even if you do n't , someone 's bound to think you 're just lazy , and blurt out , & quot ; it 's in g , man ! & quot ; so , okay ... big deal . you can count ! you know the song goes g , c , d ... exept in the chorus , which goes c , d , em - three times , and then c , d , g the fourth time . the cool thing about it , is when the vocalist arrives and he/she ca n't sing in the key of g ! ... it has to be in the key of d ! nothing changes . the progression is still <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , etc . -- only now you 're starting from d as # <NUM> and counting . so , now we 're gon na play d , g , a ... and the chorus goes g , a , bm - three times ; fourth time is g , a , d. pretty simple , huh ? everybody can do their private math , quietly , and , in ten minutes when the tape starts to roll , everybody sounds like they knew what was up all the time . the vocalist is very impressed ! and , most of all , the guy cutting the checks is smiling
this book was great , such a heartwarming story . i only gave it <NUM> stars because i had just read marley & me before and the writing was a little better , but the story is just as good , nonetheless . i 'm so glad i know the story of gracie and three dog bakery now !
i bought the cd 4/yrs ago ; it sounded great then and it still sounds good today.such great talent for a father and son.i enjoy every song thats on the cd , but then i like eddie and gerald levert whether they are singing solo or together/
i grew up with gene kelly performances and so this box set is wonderful . `` singin ' on the rain '' is one of his classics , as well as one of his best performances . `` on the town '' and `` an american in paris '' are suberb too , highlighting kelly 's different strengths . i especially liked `` anatomy of a dancer '' though because it shed light on kelly 's life that i did not know . as such i grew to respect him and his work even more . i highly recommend it for gene kelly followers and musical lovers alike
cronenberg a little more restrained than usual -- except in the jolting scenes of violence , and in the question of how and if we can change who we are . fantastic performances all around . i was very impressed
i know there are a bunch of people out there saying `` this gives metalcore a bad name '' or `` the vocalist has a lung disease '' but honestly , they are n't metalcore . trivium , shadows fall , etc . are classified metalcore , and they are definately not like them at all . their music is much more melodical than others and have great guitars solos , namely the intro to `` bleeding mascara '' . let 's go through each track one by one : <NUM> . blood children - 3/5 - a nice intro that has a nice lead into the following song <NUM> . bleeding mascara - 5/5 - i can not stress enough how great of a song this is . the guitars in this song are amazing and the lyrics are very advanced . very nice high paced song that is great for getting your adrenaline going . <NUM> . right side of the bed - 4/5 - this song has a very catchy drum rhythm that keeps you listening through the entire song . they chose this song to make a music video for , which was also nicely done . <NUM> . this flesh is a tomb - 3/5 - this song is n't the greatest on the album , but definately a fine song that is worth listening to . <NUM> . you eclipsed by me - 5/5 - this song was the song that got me addicted to atreyu 's music . `` i will not be broken , i am , the one '' boom ! ! this song is a blast of harsh lyrics that will leave you breathless ! <NUM> . the crimson - 4/5 - this song also has a music video for it . it 's not the fastest paced song , but if you enjoy singing/screaming along with your music , this would definately be the easiest to do so . <NUM> . the remembrance ballad - 1/5 - this song was probably the most boring song on the entire album . it never picks up at any point in time , the lyrics are weak , and the singing is terrible . very easily could have been left off of the album . <NUM> . the interlude - 3/5 - not sure if it was completely necessary , but it was a nice way to slow you down before getting hit with the next song . <NUM> . corseting - 5/5 - this song is bursting with energy ! a crazy high paced song that keeps your rolling through the entire song . it 's hard for anyone not to enjoy this song ! <NUM> . demonology & heartache - 3/5 - not my favorite , but definately is a nice song . the guitars in the song are very nice and add a great amount of melody to the song . <NUM> . my sanity on the funeral pyre - 3/5 - it was really hard to rate this song , because it has a very slow intro and has a hard time picking up , but after it starts it does has some very cool bass guitaring that makes the song fun to listen to . <NUM> . nevadas grace - 5/5 - this song is probably the most fun-sounding out of the album . peaceful , yet with the screaming it still keeps the song very interesting . <NUM> . five vicoden chased with a shot of clarity - 4/5 - a nice way to end this album . a slightly slow intro , but definately picks up with both guitars and has a very creepy guitar ending that leaves you desperate for more ! this album is definately worth buying , do n't let your collection be without it
i feel like such a fool ! this album is <NUM> years old and i heard it for the first time a few weeks ago . what 's more , i 've since asked several of my friends who also love neo-soul music if they 've heard it , and may of them did n't even know who i was talking about . that is a crime , because this album is fantastic . fantastic , i say . it 's one of those albums where i did not have to look at the album credits to see who wrote and produced the songs . it 's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote . this is what i appreciate most about the neo-soul genre ; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers . they are musicians . ( this is what is so frustrating about brian mcknight , incidentally . he is a musician , but still refuses to sing in his vocal range . many of the songs that he has written for himself are too high for him ! that just should n't be ) in any case , go get this album if you like good music
i daresay that mann 's adaptation of the film is better than cooper 's book . expanded scenes are slight , but fun additions to the a fantastic film
the follow-up to the original `` best of '' ngdb collection , more great dirt , consists of more of the <NUM> 's country hits during their long career . the ngdb was once a folk and country-rock band , but the majority of the songs on more great dirt come from their mainstream country days , which were the most overlooked of their albums . they really had no one big radio hit during this time ( except for `` fishin ' in the dark ) , which hurts this record , as does the fact that it is very overshadowed by the `` will the circle be unbroken '' albums that were huge hits . the highlights of the album include the summertime hit `` fishin ' in the dark , '' bruce springsteen 's `` cadillac ranch , '' and the rocking `` down that road tonight . '' it is too bad that there are only ten tracks here . in my opinion , this is n't up to par with the classic ngdb , but it is still good , quality country and folk . a good purchase if you want an overview of their latter days
a good fun book but not as good as some of the author 's prior efforts . kenny schilling , a football player in an `` o.j . '' type standoff with the cops is accused of murdering another player . he wants andy carpenter to defend him . kenny has no recollection of what happened while the murder took place , just like one of andy 's prior clients ( remember `` open and shut '' ) . andy takes on the case and seems to change his theory as to what transpired almost every <NUM> pages of the book . hidden in the background of the story is his relationship with laurie , who has an irresistible offer that would involve breaking up with andy . you need to wait till almost the end of the book to find out the outcome ( unless you already had a sneak peak into the author 's next book ) . though the book is better than a lot of courtroom thrillers out there it is slow the first 150-200 pages ( the book is only about <NUM> pages ) and andy seems to not be as sharp witted and interesting as he was in the author 's prior works . also , the author tries to fake out the reader twice with resolutions but both times there are still a lot of pages to go and so unresolved fine details ( reminiscent of the movie `` taking lives '' ) that the reader is far from fooled . this book should be read but you should start with the author 's first book ( `` open and shut '' ) before getting to it .
defense argued , `` law does not exist in the confederate prison . therefore , the raiders are not guilty of breaking any law '' , `` these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive '' , `` only rebel law applies in the prison '' . outcries from other union soldiers were heard , `` we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics . what about us ? '' prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men : 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft . the military jury found the six raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging . the union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized . mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft ; however , once intolerance levels are hit , a violent revolution transpires . the raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial . however , the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the raiders . the `` great escape '' with mcqueen probably took its plot from andersonville . the story line had a ton of similarities . andersonville has a fair share of violence . at one point the directors portrays the prisoners as zoombies , in the land , of the walking dead . scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness , in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy , abhorrence of the injustices , and despair of the troops . heroism abounds , leaders reject traitorous offers to defect , form their regiment , about face , and march away from on looking confederate admiral making offer . factually , 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation , disease , and crime . inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water , over crowding of the prisoners , no prisoner exchange , and looting . andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value , as a civil war movie . the characters were passionate , compelling , and captivating .
a good cd but if your looking for a god version of these songs you must ! absolutly have to hear the studio versions on the other albums . but this is a must have for the hardcore fan
this is a very good album . the only reason i did n't give this version a five is because of the ommission of bob 's voice at the end of lovelight . get the original cd that still has weir singing at the end of lovelight
this is a very enjoyable and lighthearted look at love through the eyes of two people who fall in love but try to deny their feelings for each other . ms. lopez plays a wedding planner who falls in love with the fiance of one of her clients . the scene where she has a little too much to drink is sweet , charming , funny and at the same time touching which is quite an accomplishment for any actress . ms. lopez is a lady of many talents . she can sing , dance and act and sometimes do all three at the same time ! she also proves she is much beter at this genre of film than the tiresome sandra bullock and meg ryan . encore ms . lopez ! !
throughout his musical career , chris de burgh has offered albums filled with beautiful , creative and imaginative songs . the storyman carries this idea to its zenith with a collection of incredible tracks . `` one world '' is the perfect expression of spiritual and secular equality . performed and sung beautifully , it is one of de burgh 's finest moments . the heart wrenching `` the shadow of the mountain '' and uplifting `` raging storm '' are both utterly beautiful . `` the sweetest kiss of all '' is a touching love song with a fantastic melody . `` the mirror of the soul '' is classic storytelling in musical form while `` the storyman '' is a synopsis of all that is de burgh and his career in one song . the album , as a collection , is complete , cohesive and well recorded . each track stands as an example of the best in songwriting from practically any artist in popular music . i am personally devastated by the power and beauty of this album . chris de burgh has impressed me once again . it 's an incredible musical accomplishment
ok when i first read this book i was <NUM> years old and after the first time i found it my local library i was never able to find it again because i forgot the title and the author but i never forgot the story or the beautiful artwork . now that i 'm <NUM> and there 's now the internet to use , i 'm happy to have found this book again ! i 've been looking for this book for <NUM> years , it is worth the search and will be memorable to any child who reads it . ^_^
i like this book very much . it has a lot of good information
this early nabokov novel is not of the mindbending genius of later works like pale fire and lolita , but it is still better than even the best work by many other writers . nabokov is a brilliant stylist and imagines the world of his protagonist brillantly . the phrasing is sparse and compelling , but as the main character 's mind starts to disintegrate , so does the book . the last third is a bit of a disppotment . a disappointment only because its a nabokov novel , and i 've come to expect such great things for him . its worth the time , especially if you have an interest in chess , but i 'd read his later works first
james , you let me down , brother ... i thought out of all the people in the world , you were gon na be the one that lived forever . i thought you were immortal , super-bad , and impervious to death . that 's okay , man , i forgive you . you will continue to live on in my heart , my mind , and of course , in my soul with your great recordings . i know that wherever you are now , james , you are makin ' it funky . thank you for blessing my life ...
an unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding , real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music . this was never more true than in the case of john michael montgomery , whose <NUM> debut cd life 's a dance is an undoubted <NUM> star release . full of great stone country ( beer and bones , life 's a dance , nickels and dimes and love - originally recorded by charley pride - and dream on texas ladies ) , montgomery 's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones . the album 's biggest hit was the quality ballad , i love the way you love me . unfortunately , as early as his second album kickin ' it up ( the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered ) , montgomery 's song selections became more mor and less traditional country . his greatest hits cd is worth a listen , but if you want one jmm album in your collection , it has to be this , his first
this film is a martial arts film , but not a typical one . it does have stunning fight scenes ( the opening will leave you breathless ) , that are fast paced and well thought out . however it is n't all fight scenes , there is a lot of character development with the protaganist ( jet li ) . you see him as a child , and this shows how huo yuan jia 's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed . he will go through an incredible transformation before the film 's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts . the story is very effective , and has a good deal of touching moments . jet li fits the role well , and like `` hero '' it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is . his facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character . target audience : anyone in their teens and above who do n't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy
i do n't usually like these type of movies , but this is a ca n't miss ... you 'll laugh
my daughter is just learning to read , so she can manage only the simplest text when reading a book herself . however , she still wants a good story that will hold her interest . & quot ; nine men chase a hen & quot ; was the perfect combination of silliness and simplicty for her to both manage the book on her own and to enjoy the aburd text and illustrations
bubble from ab fab sounds exactly like marilyn monroe , billie holiday , judy garland and others . what a talent . she needs her own las vegas show . she would be beyond great !
just because you are paranoid does not mean they are not out to get you . the title says it all and you have seen it a million times . you have to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are shades of the `` bourn identity '' appear , as jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) must find out not only who they are but also who he is . and will alice sutton ( julia roberts ) believe him or not or is she the bad guy or a target ? aside from the plot is powerful acting by powerful actors . how do they handle trust ?
i enjoyed robert webber 's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well . at a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the `` fate '' of the church in america . so much `` commodification '' has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be `` ecclesia '' ? although i agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church ( the lutheran church-missouri synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which webber received his doctorate from ) , my question is are we truly called to `` change '' the church in order to meet the people where they are at ? i agree with his assessments yet i question the reasonings behind doing it . do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others , just because the culture would be more `` prone '' to come to the church ? or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture ? our self-centered culture always asks the question `` what does this mean for me ? `` , and this has been a active question in the church for sometime . i believe the question that we should be asking is how does god give meaning to me , or what do i mean to god ? our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the lord of the cosmos
very interesting look at the the makeup of the new hampshire primary and interesting facts and history
up till now my favorite chris whitley album was dirt floor . there 's another favorite now ; this latest album by the late great floor-stomping singer is raw and rocking with a twist . the hard drive works to perfection in combination with a souring violin . buy this cd and if you do not own a copy of dirt floor buy that one tw
this book by reader 's digest is wonderful . i know some basic needlepoint and embroidery , but this book also has instructions for knitting and crocheting , of which i know little about . also has section on rug-making ! very comprehensive and easy to follow
i thoroughly enjoyed this book . if you 've read as many mountaineering books as i have , eventually you may read a dozen accounts of the same epic mountaineering tragedy . even if i 'd heard the story before i was enchanted with the burgess viewpoint . i also encountered some of the tales about the twins ' antics in other books . and i was delighted to hear them tell their own stories . their respect for the local people and customs was very important to me . it 's a much better world with the burgess twins in it ! thanks for sharing your stories with the rest of us
i give this memoir five stars for the the author 's curiousity , acumen and intelligence , all of which inform this wide-ranging tale . eating my words will answer your questions about mimi sheraton 's adventures as a new york times food critic , travel writer and magazine editor , as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed four seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens . through it all , sheraton reveals a keen intellect , a dedication to research , and a passion for accuracy . her prose is direct rather than lyrical , but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well . especially worthy savoring are sheraton 's love for her husband , richard falcone -- their marriage of <NUM> years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir , and sheraton 's reminiscences of her parents , who imbue her with wit , chutzpah , and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary . also welcome are sheraton 's observations about the workplace : `` it 's not your job , the employer has rented it to you , '' she observes , noting that if the job no longer suits you , it is time to quit -- something that sheraton did several times in her career , including her departure from the new york times . my appreciation for sheraton and this book grew as i progressed through the narrative . my initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir , chiefly because of my admiration for sheraton and her well-lived life . this is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned , thankfully , has chosen to share her experiences with us . we should all be so lucky
verdura is a great book which we have had for years now . viana has a delightful cooking style which really focuses on the essense of vegitables ... particularly fresh , in-season produce . her recipes such as tomato and peach salad , or cucumber and orange opened our eyes to new combinations . one of our favorites
a solid title here because not only are the songs here very soulful & timeless but the artists featured here are whose who that brought soul music out.back in a time period when it was a honored to be called soulful.these songs represent a time period that brought out the best in r & b radio
as usual from michelin , a high-quality , detailed road map that is very useful for anyone doing a driving tour of the region
just in time for their induction into the rock n ' roll hall of fame comes this new blondie collection that showcases some of the band 's most popular , influential songs , material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them . `` sound & vision , '' like most best of sets is both a good introduction to the band 's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes blondie , but enough to purchase every album . there is no doubt that debbie harry and the gang not only produced good music , but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like shirley manson , gwen stefani and yes , madonna . befire princess diana ever graced magazine covers , harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real punk at heart , posing at times with such figures as joey ramone and iggy pop ( eventhough at one point patti smith told her to `` get the f -- k out of rock n ' roll '' ) . `` sound and vision '' nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late <NUM> 's through mid-80 's . a lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like `` call me '' with it 's roaring chorus and electro sheen while `` heart of glass '' is still a classic jam , disco has died and yet this song remains . `` rapture '' is still a long , dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before aerosmith and run dmc ever broke the barrier of rock and rap . newer material is also present here , `` maria '' was a single off the band 's <NUM> album `` no exit , '' but it still has that classic blondie sound . however i do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song `` good boys '' off their latest release , `` the curse of blondie . '' the original version is a great song , but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow , the same for the `` in the flesh '' remix which rips the song apart , turning it into cold , techno sludge . luckily there is one worthy remix present , `` rapture riders , '' which brilliantly meshes `` rapture '' with the doors ' `` riders on the storm . '' both songs flow perfectly together and it 's a fitting combination since blondie have always named the doors as a prime influence and favorite band . too bad jim morrison died in <NUM> , you get the feeling he and harry would have done a marvelous duet . the extra dvd that comes with the set is a must for blondie fans , many of the band 's videos are included for classics like `` heart of glass , '' `` the tide is high '' and even the recent videos for `` maria '' and `` good boys . '' `` sight in sound '' a fun ride through the blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies , and a neat teaching tool for those who wan na know why girls like gwen , shirley and even britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from
this collection of mad libs were hilarious . it had everybody in the room in stitches . plus , it was a great review of what verbs , adjectives , adverbs , etc . are
`` the purple rose of cairo '' was the first allen 's movie i saw back in moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films . `` the purple rose ... '' is wonderful , is one if allen 's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor , romance and drama , reality and fiction . it is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and depression era new york city where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater . the story focuses on cecilia ( mia farrow ) , a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man ( danny aiello ) . cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities . one day , as she watches `` purple rose of cairo '' for the 10th or maybe 15th time , the leading man tom baxter ( jeff daniels ) decides to leave the movie and be with cecilia in real life . his screen partners are left confused and `` trapped '' in a scene they ca n't get out of . the live actor who plays baxter is blamed by the film 's producer for his character 's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen . cecilia 's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening . on the top of all , tom baxters in other theaters try to leave `` purple rose of cairo '' , too ... it is not the first or last time allen has played with the concept of the thin line ( in this film , the silver screen ) that divides film 's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet , gentle , sad , technically realized and simply terrific as `` purple rose of cairo '' . 9.5/10
. . . then this film may be for you ! like `` ju-on : the grudge , '' `` ju-on <NUM> '' presents a series of interconnected vignettes . though the non-linear presentation can sometimes confuse the viewer , it takes only a moment to realize the correlation between the last portrait and the next . so , be patient ; ) this film has a bit of a postmodern spin ( which many horror-film scholars may enjoy ) . one of the main characters , kyoko harase , plays an actress known as `` the queen of horror . '' she is taken to the infamous saeki home to give a television interview about her own experience as a horror actress . it is there that she is marked with the curse ( in a fairly unpredictable way ! ! ) and , there that true horror enters her own life . to the joy of many viewers , toshio figures prominently into `` ju-on <NUM> . '' though the make-up on toshio is a little flat ( unlike `` ju-on the grudge '' ) his acting is still pitch-perfect . nonetheless , it is interesting to note that yuya ozeki ( who play toshio saeki ) did not understand the part he was playing in earlier films ( simply as a result of his tender age ) . he has now refused to watch his own films and his parents go to the premieres alone : ) ( you can discover this information on the american version of `` the grudge '' in takashi shimizu 's commentary ) . some reviewers seem hyper-critical of this work . yes , the film has some missteps , but they are easily overlooked . if you watched and enjoyed `` ju-on : the grudge '' then try `` ju-on <NUM> '' . . . you might be pleasantly surprised !
this text helped me to articulate the 'principles ' of standard english by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively . such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive , standard vs. nonstandard , formal vs. informal , grammatical vs. ungrammatical , and constitutive vs. regulative . this introductory text is written for the mature student who has had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar . consequently , the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge . i highly recommend this text for english education majors and secondary school english teachers .
what a fun show ! we saw this when it was first released and had such a good time rocking away . we always loved the artistry and staging . but it is the music that sells the project . so thrilled to find it on amazon in dvd format ! after so many years , it 's still a great show
i spent two weeks cruising the italian neighborhoods of san francisco looking for a restaurant like the one portrayed so richly in this movie . and i found one ! unfortunately , as might have been predicted from the film , it lasted only a few months before folding . there 's more to big night than the food . it 's outrageously funny , for one thing , a quality many reviewers seemed not to appreciate . the acting is brilliant ; for once , everyone acts in ensemble . it 's original , not quite any hollywood genre . it 's poignant , in emotional terms most people can find believable . is it a great movie ? dumb question ! it 's a movie you 'll enjoy and remember
rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star , and love do n't live here anymore and ca n't forget the classic i 'm goin down remade by mary j blige , ynv , and more recently camron ooh boy . and ca n't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ai n't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich 's memory alive
but i never understood why they did n't catch on . they had a bona fide producer in kay gee ( naughty by nature ) , incredible vocal chemistry , heavy-duty promotion , and catchy singles . this resulted in an impressive debut . so why the snub ? i guess that will always be a mystery . anywho , along with blackstreet and age ai n't nuthin ' but a number , pronounced jah-nay ranks as one of the top five best hip-hop/soul debuts of <NUM> . and here 's why . it was a very cohesive record , consisting of five r & b entries , with `` hey mr . d.j . `` , `` groove thang '' , and `` sending my love '' making the top five . you think that 's the story ? not ! . the story is how good the rest of the album is . in fact , i will say ( like other very strong debuts ) that the album tracks are better than the singles . and that 's saying a lot , given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the <NUM> 's . those tracks are : `` sweet taste of love '' , `` changes '' , `` la la la '' , `` for a reason '' and `` hey mr. d.j . remix '' . that 's eight cuts that should get played everytime it 's in the cd player . it does n't get much better than that . in sum , zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records . however , their fame did n't last long . they would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set . but their debut will never be forgotten . it 's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh . and that 's what makes it irresistibly catchy . a hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one , but a casual listener should as well . grade : a
this is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing . kevin spacey is perfect in this movie , and benicio del torro and gabriel bryne do well in it too . the plot seems to be nothing out of the ordinary action/hiest/shoot-em-up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today 's movie theaters , but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one . all great movies should have great endings , and this one does
wow did this one catch me by surprise . i thought for sure i was getting another goofy jackie movie . not even close ! the movie starts out with jackie as a drunken cop . after showing him in some disgusting drunken moments , we get to see why he became like this . there is a group of kids going around terrorizing the police . they will do a standard bank job or something like that and then wait for the cops . having serious firepower , skills that will relate to the x games later in the movie , and already being rich , the cops certainly have theri hands full . so the cops have serious problems and they finally get jackie in a deadly game of 'can you do this to keep your fellow officers alive ' ? needless to say he does n't and becomes a drunk . when the band of x-games teens are causing trouble again a young cop tries to get jackie to help out . i know you have probably heard this type fo a cop story before but this movie is seriously one of the best looking movies i have seen in a while . all of the locations and buidings they are in are great to look at . if you have seen jackie chan 's who am i ? , rumble in the bronx , or even the well done first strike , then get ready for a change . new police story has very high production values and it is not cheesy . might not be what you are used to in a jackie movie , but it was a very nice change to see this . the movie gets between a 3.5 and a <NUM> but could have gotten a <NUM> . rongguang yu ( the iron monkey ) is in this movie and him and jackie do not fight . that dissapointed me just a bit , but they still had some really good scenes together . the special features are pretty good with behind the scenes , behind the dubbing of jackie doing his voiceover and a commentary for <NUM> scenes . also the picture is widscreened but the picture quality needs to be commented on . it seemed like i was watching a high definition tv . very nice
this movie is just as good as i remembered . it 's a classic disney fairy tale , full of love , longing , fear , action , and beautiful songs . and the scene with sebastian and the chef is priceless ! if you have n't seen it yet , you ca n't miss this film
well , lmb did it again . she completely beguiled me ! she has created yet a third universe , after the vorkosigan nexus and the world of chalion , and it is a really plausible fantasy . she introducted the notion of `` ground '' , a mysterious life-force that pervades everything , from humans , through mosquitoes and fireflies , down to rocks , glass bowls and shards thereof , and can be perceived by the lakewalkers `` groundsense '' . and this notion is very central to the plot ( `` ground '' comes so early that mentioning it is not a spoiler ) . so certainly the book is a fantasy , and quite a well-constructed one . it is also romance , and a very sweet romance it is . of course , it is not a book , just half of one . the ending is not an end , you really are left waiting for the second half . but the cutting point is well-chosen , i think i 'll survive till `` legacy '' comes out on july 1st . but just barely ..
this cd is mad nice .... this is mr lifs first offcial lp .. on this one , its a concept cd that talks all about gov and a person tryna live in the system of society and life in america its takes a few listens to understand it all , but i mostly enjoyed this one .... its not as consistant as `` emergency rations '' , which i belive is his best work cd ... thats my only problem with it .... other than that ... if yall like backpacker/politcal rap .. frab this one and akrobatik 's balance cd=
recently , i have read a lot of books on creativity and innovation . my big surprise is that virtually none of them mention koestler 's the act of creation . this is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity . attention to this classic is worth reviving . koestler examines three types of creativity - humor , science , and poetry . humor , according to him , is cruel ( a valuable insight ) . poetry , and other forms of art , integrate oneself with the world . science occupies the neutral middle . it is amazing how koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework . my two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form . as koestler describes beautifully - `` .. uncovers , selects , re-shuffles , combines , synthesizes already existing facts , ideas , faculties , skills . the more familiar the parts , the more striking the new whole . '' this is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood ` on the shoulder of giants ' . even inventors like edison fit this framework . this is close to saying that instead of thinking ` outside the box ' , link several boxes to each other . the other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal , but in images . so people see new insights in a dream-like trance , rather than expressing it in language . language , probably , impedes creativity . there are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece . nearly a bible on creativity .
this was the first book i read by deaver . it got me hooked . i loved the suttle twists in the plot . very real . i could really see these things happening to someone . if you have never read anything by deaver , read this one first
does n't get anymore classic than this ! two legends just sitting down and doing what they do best
i love this story , i was loving it from page one up until the last comic . i mean here we have a great subtly running plot in thorpe , silver , and the deceased doctor , but then suddenly in the last issue we see none of the three stories resolved . yes , we are implied strongly that the doctor does away with thorpe , but that isnt good enough , what of thorpe 's empire , how does batman find out , and do we ever see the ghost again , maybe we do n't , maybe we 're better for it . but as for silver , at least i was sad to see her walk away as yet another superhero-girlfriend-itis casualty and not have anything more happen along the lines of her life in general , or batman 's general dealing with it . anyways , at least these were just issues and not an intended mini-series , so all of these qualms are pretty much null and void . as a whole , its an awesome story
this cat can bust.it does n't matter what he raps about , he 's just tight on the mic.he is an under rated underground rapper so far.believe me i know hip hop
having left my gothic club mix cd at home , i decided to buy this one . what hooked me first was the live recording of `` bela lugosi 's dead '' by bauhaus , which is classic goth music . some of the bands i liked , some i did n't , but all in all this is a great cd . my favorite is `` sheryl '' on the second cd . this is a great cd for chilling , dancing , or showing the uneducated masses what goth music really is
the f-105 is a most fascinating aircraft . a superb cold-war design ; it was meant to be a sort of man-guided supersonic cruise missile for delivery of nuclear weapons to tactical targets in the european theater . it was , of course , never used for this purpose , but was instead put to a use in the air war over vietnam . the thud was never meant to be a precision dive bomber , or to pass through heavily defended areas at subsonic speeds . all the same , politicians dictated this use ( and of course went looking for someone besides themselves to blame when their `` top fighter-bomber '' started getting shot down in heroic quantity ; so many were shot down , there were n't enough seasoned men to continue to fly them . they were shot down in so many myriads , fresh out of pilot school fighter-bomber jocks , or long grounded middle-aged desk jockies would be put directly into combat ( where they would often be shot down ) . the men who flew this jet were , as the cliche goes , a special breed of heroes . unlike , say , fighter pilots or b-52 pilots , they faced almost certain death , or horrible imprisonment . their survival rate was comparable to that of the b-17 tailgunner over germany in ww-2 ; very low indeed . oftentimes their missions were secret in nature , so the government could n't even acknowledge that the thud had been shot down and work for the release of the pilot . major rasimus ' memoire takes place at a crucial escalation in the war ; in <NUM> . the johnson administration decided to escalate the war by `` sending messages '' to the north vietnamese via the use of bombing as a psychological and diplomatic tool . the hare-brained scheme was that , by bombing one thing , and not another , the nva would be trained , like a pet dog is trained with a rolled up newspaper . the idea was ridiculous , and of course did n't work . rasimus was one of those unsung heroes who , fresh out of pilot school , grew enormous handlebar moustaches to protect them from evil on their impossible missions . he tells the tales of the base dog , roscoe , and of various of his team , and those who came after . you can practically smell the oil on the tarmac , and the blackpowder charges which combat-started the '105 's engines . while americans would rather forget the war in vietnam , i ca n't forget the courage of these men who fought in these insane supersonic contraptions . may their spirit inspire a new generation of warriors . thanks ed ; for your service and your great book
i think that carmen rasmusen has a beautiful voice , go to her website , and listen for yourself before you go letting people that are obviously trying to sabotage her ( and the american idol show as well ) make up your mind for you . i do n't know where those people get that carmen sounds like a goat . that 's just crazy talk ! i bet those people hurling insults could n't sing to save their own lives . oh ... and just for the record ... i 'm not a family member
some books are optional . `` the worm ouroboros '' , by e. r. eddison , is not . it is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it . it is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply do n't do . when you read `` the worm ouroboros '' you 'll realize that modern writers produce stories , but they do n't tell stories . since the english language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review , i 'll just have to present samples of eddison 's writing : `` but a great wonder of this chamber , and a marvel to behold , was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone , carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster : here was a harpy with a screaming mouth , so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her : here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake : there a cockatrice made of a single ruby : there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight , cut for a cyclops , so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye : leviathans , all hewn from faultless gems , thrice the bulk of a big man 's body , velvet-dark sapphires , crystolite , beryl , amethyst , and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold . '' ( <NUM> ) everyone can write description , but only eddison could write description like this . he makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the `` monsters '' stick out in your mind . and even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like , you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph . eddison realized that you ca n't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times . `` now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills , and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days ' space in the zia valley , above the gorges . here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre , and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side . high in the south , couched above great gray moraines , the zia glacier , wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos , thrusts his snout into the valley . here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders , casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather . the air blows sharp from the glacier , and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight . '' ( <NUM> ) perhaps it 's because i 'm a mountain-climber myself , but i found juss and brandoch daha 's assault on koshtra pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters . in real life no two mountain ranges are alike , yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains . eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers , feel the biting cold winds , and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes , he needs to give his mountains some real personality . these samples , of course , only scratch the surface of eddison 's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor ; he maintains this level , never flagging , for all two hundred thousand words . but of course `` the worm ouroboros '' could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing . on one side king gorice xii of witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will . opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of demonland , lead by the magnificent lord juss and his family . the ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea , across continents and mountain ranges . and without any doubt eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration : `` la fireez , '' said juss , `` we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee . yet must i hold my course ; having sworn a strong oath that i would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until i had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage . so sware i or ever went that ill journey to carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered . nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination . but when that is done , no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of pixyland , and many good things besides to be a token of our love . '' said the prince , `` thou doest right . if thou didst other thou'dst have my blame . '' `` and mine thereto , '' said gaslark . `` do not i grieve , think'st thou , to see the princess armelline , my sweet young cousin , grow every day more wan o ' the cheek and pale ? and all for sorrow and teen for her own true love , the lord goldry bluszco . and she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire , thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately . i deem to-day better than to-morrow , and to-morrow better than his morrow , to set sail for wide-fronted impland . '' ( <NUM> ) one of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life . `` the worm ouroboros '' is larger than larger than life . indeed , after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as `` smaller than eddison ''
this set is absolutely great ! my children love this and watch it over and over again . is a must have for any child that loves dora , blues clues , little bill , and the backyardigans . wonderful gift idea hours of fun

in an age when the advent of computer-generated sudoku seem to be taking over , matt gaffney responds with this very eloquent and entertaining exploration of standard crosswords and how they are created . gaffney , an experienced puzzle constructor and editor , offers glimpses into the history of crosswords and their attributes , but the real strength of his book is its insight into the effort that constructors go in making gems for puzzlers . he discusses the way that puzzle themes have evolved over time , the limits of themed and non-themed puzzles , challenges that constructors have posed themselves , and how new-wave constructors have pushed the boundaries of puzzles using technology to help them fill grids and using their twisted brains to find ever-more-intriguing clues . this book is well written in a conversational style filled with humorous anecdotes and includes interviews with many editors and constructors . of most interest to me was a chapter in which four constructors are given partially completed grids and are asked to use their brains or computer assistance to generate `` fills '' that they think are best . the results are beautifully divergent , and the way that judges viewed them and rated them points out that the nature of `` beauty '' in crosswords is still a contested area . like amende 's `` crossword obsession '' and romano 's `` crossworld '' this book focuses on a very small field , but the thoroughness and humor that suffuse it make it a strong addition . this book will offer you insights into puzzles if you are a novice and will generate laughs of recognition and empathy if you are an expert or constructor . i recommend it . will j
martin denny died last week . the end of an era for me . as a kid i would grab my father 's vinyl lp 's of exotica and quiet village and transport myself to tropical lands beyond my dreams , listening to denny 's soothing sounds and exotic bird-call melodies . julius wechtler on the vibes was one of my early favorites . ( i actually saw him , as leader of the baja marimba band as the opening act for wayne newton ! ) when all my little pals were buying lp 's from some english group called the beatles , i was kickin ' it to martin denny . this re-mastered double cd is a trip right back to those magical days in front of my parents `` hi-fi '' ! and without all of the snap-crackle-pop of the originals ! awesome ! ! as long as martin denny 's music lives , so will he ! ! aloha , mr. denny ! and thanks for everything ! keep a mai tai ready for me at that big don the beachcomber bar in the sky !
you got ta admit that this is not the same genie in a bottle girl showing up on this album . this is a very mature album and glad that christina took charge of her direction in music . it definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it wo n't be disappointed .
for those of you who saw the dolls back in the '70 's , this is a time capsule version that brings you back to max 's kansas city , kenny 's castaways , club <NUM> , and more . the dolls are young , brash , alive , and vital . seeing johnny healthy and built , or jerry nolan chubby , it 's worth the price of admission . all of the dolls are energetic and engaging . at the time , the world was their oyster and there was no place to go but up . great sloppy chaotic versions of their greatest non-hits . a nice feature of the dvd is the performance only section , as well as the commentary . it does bog down a little in the middle , but picks right back up again as soon as the band hits the stage . some of the comments are very funny . the black & white photography lends a `` historic '' feel . it 's way better than it should be , given the time & technology advances since then . it ends around with the red patent leather gigs at the little hippodrome , but without fan fare or anything maudlin .

expense or baggage of an original welles production . he was hired to direct & act . the movie was made to make money & therefore to be done under budget . welles succeeded & did an excellent , stylish , directing job . in a bit of over-acting he also played the part of creepy dr. charles rankin , formerly franz kindler , nazi war criminal to perfection . this now an old fashioned movie but <NUM> was the perfect time for it 's subject : nazis hiding in our midst , such as a small town in connecticut . this film noir drama may have been made on the cheap but it 's stars are first rate . besides welles , edward g. robinson plays title role , & comes to town under the guise of an antique dealer . he is actually a federal nazi hunter on the trail of franz kindler . loretta young is perfecting her role as the idiot wife of kindler/dr . rankin . you might remember her as david nevin 's stupid spouse in the bishp 's wife several years later . kindler is embedded as a professor at a private prep school . he seems to be popular with the boys . about half way through the movie , mr. wilson has a pretty good idea who dr. rankin really is . the climax is to be expected but is still well done , on a subject that still of interest today , facism in america
i got strange looks when people spotted me reading war and peace . not many <NUM> year olds took on the challenge . yet i did , and enjoyed myself immensely . if you read it in a public place , you 'll most likely get funny looks for reading the very complicated unabridged book . and i can assure you that you will most likely enjoy yourself almost as much as i did . `` war and peace '' tells of many different characters , goes through their lives , and describes the very complicated connections they all have with each other . it is a huge book , and for the first two hundred pages , one ca n't even tell someone what the book is `` about '' , because it 's not quite clear . but then it does become clear , and it all starts making wonderful sense . you ca n't help but fall in love with some of the characters and the way they act , because they 're such special characters , and it feels as though you truly know them . despite its length , this book is totally worth it ; worth the time , the effort , the headaches , the angry mutterings about things not going your way ... it 's worth everything .
i just ca n't say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys . i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about <NUM> months old . he loves them . and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen . : ) as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile . he is captivated . i like them much more than the baby einstein videos . and the toys ....... he loves them . `` hello , brainy baby ! '' they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box . i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time . we love brainy baby at our house .

i loved the series kindred the embraced . it taught me a lot about the differant types of vampires . i really wish it didnt end . i wanted more of the story . it also had a love story involved . all round good series .
this film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great american films in any age . artur penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations . this film threw the ring to robert redford and gave brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role . and despite the multiple problems among penn and the illumination supervisor according to penn told in an interview with james lipton in inside the actor 's studio , the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great american artistic triumphs .
a documentary film crew on the amazon river finds itself shanghaied into a crazy river rat 's ( jon voight ) quest to capture a giant anaconda . `` moby dick , '' it ai n't . but it is a lot of fun , with smart writing , some good thrills , decent special effects , and quirky performances . voight , in particular , is hugely entertaining as he steps right up to the line between acting and mugging for the camera and remains precariously balanced there for the length of the film

our grand daughter acts out this entire book with dramatic embellishments and subtle interpretation . it is the most interactive book a youngster from <NUM> months on can love and enjoy forever
for most people , this kind of lifestyle is only a dream , but wow , what colourful and beautiful dreams . this book is choc full of stunning photos that reflect the wealth some people luckily or unluckily have . their houses ( or should i say shrines ) are treasures in their own rights , but the possesions inside are also gems . the tiffany theme is reflected in here all the way through and there is some stunning pieces . this is a pricey 'coffee table ' book , but it 's so beautiful , you 'll be glad you treated yourself or someone else
margaret abraham has poured an enormous effort into sorting out the various dynamics , both above the surface and well below , of the discourse centering on the plight of south asian women coming to the united states . it is to her credit that her research has such size and substance yet provides compelling reading , with implications for many other areas of scholarship , including feminist theory . her narrative , rich as it is in detail from the interviews she conducted , has to do with discerning ways that scholars document brutal secrets existing in an extremely contested discourse , not that of assigning some kind of victimhood . this is an important work on a difficult topic . a must read
i found this band while looking up information on trixter and found pj farley in the band . listened to ra on their website and bought this cd the same day . i have not found a band lately that took me away like ra . i have not heard the first album but it is next on my list , since i got duality today and have not stopped listening to it ! ! ! ra rocks ! ! !
reading a design patterns book for me is interesting when i find that nugget of coolness , the rest of the time it is plain boring . however , this book really keeps it interesting for the most part and still drives home the design points particularly around eai . i think it would make a great book for someone wanting to get into design patterns , which is important for anyone writing integration applications . also , it is a good all-around reference book for the serious and seasoned java programmer who needs to know how to design integration . i have gof , and i refer to this book more often from a practical standpoint
look here , i knew that there was more to this band than express yourself . this cd more than satisfied that . everything on here bumps . i can do without the slow stuff , but overall , mr. wright and company did they thang ! ! ! ! ! uhhhhh ! ! ! ! i love charles ' voice ; especially on your love ( means everything to me ) . that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver . if you like true blue funkiness , then get this . it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio , which sucks , that really bring that sausage gravy vibe . you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it
the author has taken his time to present all sides of this important event in south carolina history . by taking a dispassionate look at the contemporary accounts as well as later oral histories he allows one to make up his or her own mind as the the true events . i found no evidence of any political slant . not a novel for light reading , but easy to read . makes a case as a good text , not only in the realm of black history , but in how one event can be looked at from numerous eyes . gives one a perspective on how the history we come to accept can be changed and minipulated depending on ones desires and point of view . highly recommend this in any student of south carolina or black histories library
it 's a really good movie . i 'm from japan so i felt same things in the us several months ago . so , i can understand it . maybe , if you have never been to other countries , it 's hard to understand this movie . overall , this is a really good movie
a collection of <NUM> or more short stories by o. henry ? my mouth waters already ! it 's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this . i have spent over a year savouring these stories , reading them one by one , tasting his delightful choice of words , digesting his fascinating story-lines , and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end . o. henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate , and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller . born william sydney porter ( 1862-1910 ) , he produced <NUM> stories under the pseudonym o. henry . his stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways , each illustrated with five of my personal favorites . firstly , his brilliant use of language . these stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century , and o. henry 's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers . not only does he have an extensive vocabulary , but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories , marred only by the occasional `` lordy '' . `` ulysses and the dogman '' is a fine example of his skills with a language , metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of circe , in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets . also exemplary is `` madame bo-peep of the ranches '' where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives , and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken . `` a comedy in rubber '' uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers . and `` sisters of the golden circle '' revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters `` of the plain gold band . '' `` an unfinished story '' employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor dulcie 's struggle for survival . secondly , his unique insight into the social conditions of his time . o. henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class , and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century america with warm and sympathetic colours . his characters are frequently the overlooked : the struggling shop girl , the unsuccessful artist , the impoverished . admittedly , some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers , and the distance that time has placed between us and o. henry 's beloved new york means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with . but his genuine sympathy for the oppressed can not be missed . `` the gift of the magi '' is the signature o. henry story , probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other 's prized possession that they have just given up . another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is `` the pendulum '' , a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man , until the bubble bursts . `` the cop and the anthem '' was the first o. henry story i ever read , and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite . `` the furnished room '' is a tragic and shocking story of suicide , depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished . thirdly , his warm humour . o. henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language . frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other . and on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others . one of his most popular stories is `` the handbook of hymen '' , recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin , one armed with the hilarious herkimer 's handbook of indispensable information . and then there is o. henry 's fictional character jeff peters , a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes , two shining examples displayed in `` jeff peters as a personal magnet '' and `` the exact science of matrimony '' . `` let me feel your pulse '' pokes fun at doctors , while in `` next to reading matter '' an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane . fourthly , his ironic twist . one of the distinctive characteristics of o. henry 's short stories is the ironic twist at the end , which never fails to surprise and entertain , sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner . o. henry 's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed . like the jeff peters stories , `` the love-philtre of ikey schoenstein '' also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable . other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include `` witches ' loaves '' and `` while the auto waits '' . the twist that comes at the end of `` the hypotheses of failure '' is so perplexing , that you 'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which o. henry has misled you . but perhaps one of o. henry 's best uses of the ironic twist comes in `` the last leaf '' , a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside , and through the self-less sacrifice of another . the wordsworth collection is superlative , because it contains more than <NUM> pages of literary gems . it consists of <NUM> stories , showcasing a wide range of o. henry 's short-story talents . a few popular favorites are missing , such as `` schools and schools '' , `` shearing the wolf '' , `` the green door '' , and `` the pimienta pancakes . '' but the reality is that nearly all o. henry 's stories feature his trademark ironic twist , as they do his warm humour , his unique insight into the social conditions of the time , and his brilliant use of language , and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion . the inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring ! do n't pass up on these ! - godly gadfl
other reviewers that dont get the humor and take this as a serious movie need to lighten up ! seriously this movie cracks me up and i dont get sick of it . i 've watched it several times and it still makes me laugh every time . if you are a stoner you 'll probaly `` get it '' a little better and be laughing at these two clowns as they do bust out tons of funny catch phrases , but it is what it is , a stoner comedy made for stoners to laugh at . if you like these type of movies this one is pretty original for what it is and definitely worth adding to your collection because it isnt one of those `` watch it once and you 're over it '' movies it stays funny
this collection of three epochal films from barbra streisand 's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker . all succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers . the earliest is <NUM> 's `` the way we were '' , which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance . director sydney pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story , and he guides streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances . veteran screenwriter arthur laurents wrote a strong , multi-dimensional character for her in katie morosky . it 's quite a journey from young communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous hollywood wife in the early fifties , but streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character 's idealism and blind idolatry . matching her every step of the way is robert redford , who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well . he smartly underplays the lionized hubbell gardiner , fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations . it 's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling . in essence , the movie consists of three distinct parts : the college years when they first make impressions on each other , the wwii years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance , and the hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system . the first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments . when the story moves to hollywood , the movie gets a bit more problematic . the star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to hubbell 's studio that katie was a former communist , which in turn makes hubbell , now a rising screenwriter , a target for blacklisting . what should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up . ironically though , the film 's most powerful scene is in this section , the train station confrontation between katie and hubbell over people and their principles . but bottom line , there is no narrative connection between the hollywood blacklist and their separation , which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point . i am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes ( cut at the last minute by pollack ) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the dvd package , `` the way we were : a look back '' . i have to agree with pollack ( and disagree with streisand ) that the deleted scenes do n't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context . of course the coda outside the plaza hotel is still classic , mainly due to the brevity of dialogue , the swooning marvin hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures . the second film is <NUM> 's `` the prince of tides '' . in only her second directorial effort ( after `` yentl '' ) , streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis . she obviously found the perfect vehicle in pat conroy 's epic novel about tom wingo , a southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood , the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister 's suicide attempt . that the story revolves around a man 's personal crisis versus a woman 's may strike some as odd given streisand 's particularly female perspective , but she actually makes tom 's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result . in fact , the emotionalism streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here , and her lush , almost baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well . the movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from nick nolte , who captures all the layers of pride , regret , anger , sadness and humiliation in his character . he propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it . in fact , streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of dr. susan lowenstein , the pricey new york psychiatrist treating tom 's sister , savannah . it is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances . she also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful kate nelligan , who gets to age convincingly as tom 's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret , and blythe danner , dependably effective as tom 's conflicted wife . both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with tom , the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble . credit should be given to conroy and betsy johnston , who wrote the superb screenplay . the movie is not without flaws . first , after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie 's climax , the story shifts to an inevitable affair between tom and lowenstein and a flagrant detour into lowenstein 's own catharsis , which brings up valid questions about her character 's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient . this part of the story is streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor , as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight . regardless , it 's an impressive accomplishment to translate conroy 's lengthy , often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material , and streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together . the last movie is the weakest of the trio , <NUM> 's `` the mirror has two faces '' , still her last starring vehicle . while she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy , the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded , self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this <NUM> movie down considerably . at an epic length of <NUM> minutes , the story , adapted by richard lagravenese from a forgotten <NUM> french film , is quite slight as it focuses on rose morgan , a wildly popular columbia literature professor but also a fortyish , baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister claire and glamorous mother hannah . her lot in life seems crystallized at claire 's wedding when she weds rose 's longtime crush alex . meantime , columbia mathematics professor gregory larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic , intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage . greg places a personals ad to which claire responds unbeknownst to rose . the budding relationship between rose and greg turns on the inevitable moment when rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested greg . this leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale . as rose , streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way , even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character 's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall . like the yearning barbra of long ago , she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night . however , once rose transforms herself , streisand 's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable , soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in `` the prince of tides '' . looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older , jeff bridges plays greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves . at the time of release , lauren bacall received all sorts of kudos as hannah , though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave , make-up-free scene where hannah admits to rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted . mimi rogers provides sharp bite as claire , while pierce brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow alex and george segal ( streisand 's one-time co-star in `` the owl and the pussycat '' ) is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role . this is a worthy collection for any streisand fan
by anyone 's standars , the cmdt annuals have to be considered among the best in the business , and for several reasons . first , the annual review cycle keeps them up to date . second the fact that this is now the 46th edition means that they have had plenty of time to work out the details as to what to include and how to find it . third , each major section is written by specialists in that particular area , specialists who have worked in that area , and on this book for years . fourth is the size . the new edition is almost 2,000 pages long . it covers just about everything an internal medicine specialist is supposed to know . fifth , cdmt on-line which includes the entire book , plus several thousand addional pages , 1200+ images , drug information , patient handouts and much more . sixth , for such a book , this one is surprisingly inexpensive . all in all , this is the book by which others are compared .
you 'll love this video ! even though i 've only been to two concerts , i felt a little cheapened watching this because it kind of slaps you in the face with how canned the whole wiggles concert experience is . we got this for my son 's 3rd christmas , and he has happily watched it a few times . it 's a great way to relive the concert experience ! the feature with king mondo doing `` eagle rock '' is good , too
i dunno why this album 's so cheap , but i figure they just wanted more people to hear the good music on it . lots of bang for your buck , these are some great songs if you like college rock kind of stuff . i guess it kind of reminds me of the strokes . does n't really sound like that though

this book tells us the importance of seeing rather than drawing . in most cases the how-to book tells only about the methods , but such methods will not keep overnight . but the author of this book knows the real nature of drawing , so he advises us to draw without watching . this is the wonderful book
maybe you need to see it in the context of the show . i loved the show and the cast recording . to each his own
yes , we 've all seen great photos of classic cars in cuba -- but this book will make you swoon . your knees will buckle , and you will become feverish with desire to get yourself to cuba as soon as possible . magnificent
electric cafe was a very much delayed project and was originally called technopop and should have included the awesome single tour de france . after years of frustration and innuendo the album was finally released in <NUM> . it is way of ahead of its time in its use of sampling , loops and the way they use their keyboards . it has <NUM> awesome tracks on it starting with boing boom tshak and ending with the hypnotic electric cafe , sex object is the best track on the entire cd with amazing beats , lyrics and a melody that is quite accomplished . the book-let is typical kraftwerk with very little information and odd looking photographs . the graphics may look basic today ( <NUM> ) , but back in <NUM> this was cutting edge and if one used computers back then , then one knows how advanced these graphics truly were for their time . this is a great album from kraftwerk . it is just a shame that they record so seldom these days
this dvd will get you sweating in a hurry . i really like the interval training in the fat eliminator segment . alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly , which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser ! minna is excellent at cueing and i like her demeanor . the only thing i really do n't like about it ( and why it is not a 5-star video for me ) is all of the jumping . it is definitely not low-impact . if you have knee problems , find another video !

kaufman 's adaptation of michael crichton 's japan-bashing potboiler is a realtively light approach , a simple buddy-cop movie featuring a pair of entertaining star performances . in spite of the fact the novel 's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between eastern and western worlds around a lot of issues , the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal , transforming it into an interesting film , whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures , with sean connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations . yet sean connery makes a very credible performance , as the detective , the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys , and the ominous presence of the japanese mob with pretensions of noir film , the picture leaves us a bitter taste , because even if there are good sequences , the whole material promised best best and major intentions .
`` major payne '' is one of the funniest movies that i enjoy to watch over and over again . i thought that damon wayans delivered a knockout performance as the loud-mouthed , gold-toothed , trash talking , squeaky voiced major benson winifred payne . he was so funny that i nearly had a heart attack while laughing at the same time . after a major drug bust goes extremely well in south america , major payne ( damon wayans ) returns to parris island , south carolina and finds out that the u.s. marine corps is throwing him out of the military back into civilian life . after two weeks of civilian life , payne is let back into the military under one condition : go to virginia and train a group of delinquents for an rotc program at madison academy . payne regretfully accepts the job and puts each of the boys into <NUM> weeks of living hell ! it becomes a fight because the boys do what they can to put major payne out of their lives ! i have so many favorites scene through out this movie but the one that shines the brightest is when wayans had a dance sequence at a club where he performs a series of moves ( including a very nice `` robot '' ) , and with the help of music from <NUM> live crew . many of the gags are side-splitting funny , and the vocal tones and mannerisms of major payne are just spot-on hilarious . and the kids in the film do a remarkable job in their supporting roles . the kids in fact steal the show ( especially the younger ones ) . lots of absurdity in the movie , but still here and there peeks through a poignant maturity on the deeper symbolism of what boot camp is all about of course , it is a feel good movie so you know everything will work out in the end . base on some of the lower reviews you can see that this movie is not for everyone , but at the same time is worth seeing . if you do n't like it by the time payne does his `` failure to communicate ! '' line then maybe it is n't for you . as for me it 's utterly brilliant .
<NUM> digital filmmaking solutions has great insight , wit and humor . the author shares a wealth of experience through an easy to access manual that will both educate and entertain . no matter what your niche or experience level this book will surely shed some light on any production obstacles you may face
this is one of my most favorite cds in the history of the universe . great on rainy days ... and sunny days ... and medium days too . its good allll the time . : )
the dvd was just as good as i remembered the tv show to be . the show is both funny and serious with some of the best characters in it played by highly underrated actors . even if you do n't like 'westerns ' have no fear this is not a western . it is a fun show for all ages
of all the new order albums that i own , i would have to say that republic has been my favorite throughout the years . i enjoy listening to this album the whole way through , and with the order that they used to lay out the songs , you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again . so you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why i like it , i will tell you that i enjoy this album because of the musical style it has , which in my opinion , has a timeless and smooth quality to it . each song starts out brilliantly , and although it would go well on a pop radio station , it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune , using a fine combination of guitars , keyboards , and at times , a choir and a symphony . to describe the feel of each song , as each song progresses , you become more settled as the rythm and the background ( almost a classical style-like music ) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it 's climax . bernard sumner 's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style . with coldplay , dido , sarah mclachlan , delerium , balligomingo , and many others in my most frequently listened to category , this one definitely goes well in the mix ... the mix for chillin . :
one thing i love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them . timbuk <NUM> 's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not get tired of hearing songs you 've heard a million times on the radio . if you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one great web site . after buying this cd and the live one you will have to seach the used bins and i highly recommend the album eden alley
i have come to the conclusion that the more cartoony/funny pages books by chris hart are best written , clearly explained and better informed . this book is great to get a good feel for the <NUM> 's retro hanna barbera/ pink panther cool mccool [ giving away my age ! ! ! ] style of cartoons . the part about creating your on style and constructing heads/ bodies is good . the part on showing emotion is well thought out . as mentioned before ; the other books that deal w/ manga/mechas , etc are not that clear in terms of expalaining content/ process ; but the more humerous books are .
my gal sara and i lived on a sailboat in the caribbean for a long time and we spent most of it at anchor , as we hated marinas . besides , they were expensive . we 're both writers , so on a good day , flat seas , anchored off a deserted island like the five island group in trinidad or ile fourche , halfway between st. martin and st. barts , where it is pitch black on a cloudy night , but oh so gorgeous when the sky is clear , we 'd put these four cds along with banana wind in the cd player 's magazine , put the machine on random play , then read and write the day away with jimmy b playing in the background . there is just something about listening to mr. buffett in the caribbean , florida too , that seems so right . his catchy , lyrical , sailing stories , drinking stories , personal stories never get old . they 're as fresh the hundredth time as they were the first time . this collection is simply outstanding in every way , not a turkey in the bunch , and oh yes , mr. b has sung a few turkeys in his day , but as i said , they are not here . these songs will move you to laughter , maybe a tear or two and they may have you up and dancing a bit , but most of all they well waken a sense of adventure in you . well , they should anyway , unless you 're a died in the wool , tv watching , couch potato . but , you know , chances are that even if you do tube the day away , these songs just might get your heart pounding and your soul wanting a bit of adventure . that 's a good thing . jack priest , sailor home from the se
although many readers have commented on elizabeth ( a truly captivating character ) , her husband isaac has been given short shift . he appears in one of the book 's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the rosh hashana dinner and , in an act of private accounting , chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store . analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text , isaac then resolves to mend his ways . this scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious jewish sensibility ( surpassed , in my reading , only by chaim grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant `` rabbis and wives '' ) .
if you 're an old movie buff , as i am , i think you will like this one . i have seen it on tv but it is one for the collection . i have watched it twice already since i got it
syd barrett 's first solo album is very different from his work with pink floyd.it is much more haunting and sad than the whimsical `` the piper at the gates of dawn '' , yet it still contains psychedelic elements . the lyrics are poignant , meaningful , and haunting . `` late night '' `` dark globe '' `` long gone '' and `` terrapin '' all have beutiful instrumentation and haunting lyrics.on `` no good trying '' and `` no mans land '' , barrett 's madness comes through , but in a way that adds an excellent tinge of psychedelica . `` golden hair '' is a beutiful setting of a poem , while `` octopus '' is a fun , invigorating , whimsical , and intriquing song.not all is good though , it features the horrible songs `` feel '' `` if i'ts in you '' and `` she took a long cold look '' . they fall apart and they are out of tune.these hardly matter though , and this is an excellent album with many things you woud n't expect from a crazy , drug addicted man
i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc . i have watched the film <NUM> times and have not had a problem with the length . the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well . i think the remake is incredible ..... is it better than the original ? in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie ..... now if he can pull that off ....... ; - )
saw this movie on cable and it was so funny to my fiance ' and i that i went to amazon and bought it . i do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it
i bought this cd before going to see mmw ( with john scofield ) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec <NUM> , <NUM> . i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website . so i bought a ticket and wanted to get `` out louder '' , which i knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store i was at was out of it . so i bought `` end of the world '' instead . while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , i still liked the overall funkiness of it all . then .... i saw them play . you must see them play ! ! i did n't ever want it to end ! i immediately wanted to see them again ! it 's less than a week later and i have <NUM> more cd 's ( `` out louder '' and scofield 's `` a-go-go '' which they `` back '' him on ) and <NUM> more on the way from amazon as i 'm writing this . i 'm like an addict now ! i have to have them on in the car and in the house . i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again . i must say i like `` out louder '' and even `` a-go-go '' better than `` end of the world '' , but only slightly . it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and i do like it better after a few listens . i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians
musical genius to the limit . it ai n't no use it the most beautiful song ever written - i have listened to this over and over and over again for years , and will continue to do so .
talk about antogonist , our murder victim will have you hoping poirot lets the guilty walk this time a la ...... ( wo n't spoil that title for ya ) . very nice characters very believable twist . ms. christie proves yet again i am no hercule poirot . how do i always miss the clue
das experiment ( oliver hirshbiegel , <NUM> ) hirschbiegel , who stunned the world a few years back with der untergang , always had the chops to make tense , scary movies , and das experiment proves it . also based on a true story , this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong , as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation , with eight `` guards '' and twelve `` prisoners , '' for two weeks . by the second day , the guards are acting like guards , and the prisoners are acting like prisoners , with the exception of tarek fahd ( munich 's moritz bleibtreu ) , ostensibly a cab driver , but actually an undercover reporter ( while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done , the dvd box spoils this little surprise , so i have no qualms about mentioning it here ) who 's covering the experiment for his paper . things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time , and while one of the doctors , jutta grimm ( andrea sawatzki ) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment , project leader thon ( edgar selge ) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything 's going to pot . needless to say , things get out of control , and everyone involved , including the viewer , quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens , there is no way this is going to end well . hirschbiegel is a fantastic director , and here as in der untergang he 's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent . if you 've seen der untergang ( and even if you have n't ) , check this out . it 's well worth your time . * * *
the first section of this book contains philosophical text which is typical and conversational . it is in the second part , named 'the secret of light ' where one can find the most clear , pure explanation of the universe imaginable , in the amount of text which normally fills a small booklet . complete with diagrams , the explanation begins with god and flows out to all basic logical systems in a spectacularly balanced fashion . if you are a seeker , dont ' miss out on this one
i believe this was one of their strongest and smoothest cd 's they ever put out . fourplay is one of smooth jazz 's best supergroups . i have worn out this cd along with `` elixir '' , which is the next best one in my opinion . `` yes , please '' was the last cd before `` heartfelt '' . although heartfelt was good , it seemed like they are going in a different direction . i just previewed `` journey '' and i have to say that i most likely wo n't be buying the cd , i 'll just buy certain songs . if you want the definitive fourplay collection , get every one of their cd 's from the self titled debut to yes , please . you might even pick up `` heartfelt '' . if you want one of their best cd 's , get `` yes , please '' ! !
like many i owned this in vinyl and was amazed it took so long to come out . and to those who said they found this album a little bit sappy , i say `` so the hell what . '' everything in that era was sappy and if your worried that a little sappiness may alter your manhood then i recommend against the purchase of this cd . but if you want to listen to something thats gon na make you feel pretty damn good this is it . s & c have a well blended album here . the well known and recognized `` diamond girl '' followed by `` ruby jean and billy lee '' leads it off . both were big hits and still sound good . `` intone my servant '' follows and though not a hit you 'll wonder why . like all the others a beautifully uplifting harmonic piece . `` we may never pass this way again '' another hit shows once again how s & c can change a beautifull melody and lift your soul right out of your body and make it fly . `` nine houses '' starts off kinda odd ( the song has a mid east flare to it ) but hear it out . vocals will come in lator and pick it up . `` standing on a mountain top '' by far is one of my favorites a great countryish sound and a really great sounding guitar in this one that 'll make you feel like dancing and singing to it . `` it 's gon na come down on you '' a minor hit shoulda been `` major '' starts off mellow and beautifull and like most of there songs in this album just lifts you right up with an increase in tempo . `` jessica '' has got to be the most sappy song of the bunch . but , hey ! my niece 's name is `` jessica and it was once a favorite of mine and still is a beautifull song . `` `` dust on my saddle '' a country diddy that you may find yourself singing word for word after some time . `` wisdom '' is the only song i never listen to its a jazzy piece and i dont care for jazz much but even i got ta admit they do show off their talent on the horns . in short this is a great album from beginning to end ( which is rare to find nowadays ) and really represents the times in which it was written ( early <NUM> 's ) enjoy
i think that mario frangoulis is better than josh groban or andrea bocelli . his range is fantastic and his voice is so pure that it just speaks to your soul . he is reminiscent of the three great tenors , carreras , domingo and pavrotti . he is the best of both worlds ... pop and opera . bravo mario
i had heard of this book through someone else and wanted to read it because of the self-help quiz at the book 's website . however , when i got the chance to read it , i finished it almost in one sitting . like one of the other reviewers said , it reminds you of the basics and how the act of being nice to someone no matter what their station is in life can ultimately change your life . what i like is that the book does n't teach you to fake being nice ; it challenges you to actually be genuinely nice to others , often with no thought of gaining something in return . a simple principle but as its many examples illustrate , a powerful one that can impact your life in ways you 'd never expect .
grey gardens is well-written show , with a fine score . this album contains brilliant comic performances , as well as pathos . reminds us that the bouviers and the kennedys were quirky families , just like all of our own . the revolutionary costume for the day number at the top of act ii is utterly devestating , rendered by the brilliant christine ebersole , who plays mother in act <NUM> , and her own daughter in act ii
most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone , but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is . i am a long time u2 fan and had seen rattle and hum , but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late <NUM> . the fact that the music is wonderful is a given , but the cinematography is just astounding . i love how you get to see everything from every point of view . you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage , including the breathtaking sea of fans . you get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes . you get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on . and of course you get the passionate music . the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to . i could n't ask for more
great cd for decorating the house . it was good to hear some of my favorites singing the holiday songs . it 's very nostalgic
very imformative and cites work which is much appreciated , when reading a book like this it is important to know that you are n't reading a bunch of made up information . the book touches on a wide range of issues and is good for anyone wanting to know more about what they are eating and how it effects everyone and everything around them .
i have been listening to this album for two christmas seasons and never seem to tire of it . the instrumental pieces are very well done , beautifully providing delicate , intricate harmonies . the vocal numbers are equally well done . there is a nice selection of songs , some familiar to the modern listener , and some providing a good introduction to medieval music . this is christmas music for all ages
wow this is one crazy movie . lol christian bale is one nutty dude in this movie . the world of yuppies . one has to be better than the next , and higher up is where they all strive to be . who has better looking , more expensive business cards for one example . it 's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world . one is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill . he kills one acquaintance of his who he really does n't know , and takes him for another person . of course jared leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are , and gets killed in this movie to , and he is actually the first murder victim . his place is also where christian 's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them . this movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers . it 's very well done , and bale gives a very compelling performance . i call it yuppieville . <NUM> * rating , it has all the elements of a great thriller .
nothing new but well done . an angry spirit torments a group of friends then causes their deaths one by one . i really enjoyed the ending in this movie .
i borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it , i was n't quite sure how i would feel about it . after watching it , i have to say that i love this movie and bought it the next day . regardless of what critics have written , i loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made rent a success . yes , they are supposed to be in their <NUM> 's in the play but really , i barely noticed or frankly , could 've cared less . i love jesse l. martin and he was fantastic . idina menzel 's voice is super and was ever surprised that rosario dawson could sing . anthony rapp , adam pascal , wilson jermaine heredia and tracie thoms were great as well . yes they changed and omitted things that are in the broadway play , but if you are truelly a fan of rent , you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present : the wonderful songs !
set in san francisco and not england , the american dr. dolittle is just as comical as the original british vetrinarian in the <NUM> 's muscial . when dr. dolittle 's animal telepathic skills resurface he not only is sent to a mental institution but he ends up having to save a circus tiger 's life . this california rendition complete with scenic shots of the bay area , is a departure from the children 's books , but succeeds in its key message : either be yourself or nothing at all even if the mass population thinks you 're crazy . not being true to yourself is the direct route to driving you truly crazy
this dvd contains three episodes of `` bear in the big blue house . '' the first two have a birthday party theme . the final one does n't really anything to do with a party , but it is still rocking . the fun starts with `` mouse party '' when our friends in the big blue house put together a surprise party for tutter the mouse . the viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations , making the cake and keeping tutter in the dark . tutter considers the fact that he 's getting older and finally , viewers rock to `` happy , happy birthday '' when the time comes for tutter 's big party . next comes `` bear 's birthday bash . '' this is an episode that recalls `` mouse party '' in many ways , except this time it 's bear who 's having the birthday . he 'd like to have a nice , relaxing day , but the kids of the big blue house decide to throw him a surprise party . finally , `` dancin ' the day away '' finds everyone in the big blue house having some fun with dance . tutter , however , does n't think that he can dance , but pip and pop show him that he really can . this is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories . my favorites are tutter and ojo ( and the big old bear himself ) , but they 're all wonderful . this dvd includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs
i was around <NUM> or <NUM> when this record was released , and it was another masterpiece by the kings of metal ! this release , like the three before it , is part of the foundation of manowar 's kingdom . this is one of my favorite cd 's of all time . it has some of the heaviest moments in manowar history , it 's raw , stripped down , and heavy . this is what true heavy metal is all about . if i were going to give somebody a few cd 's to give them an idea of what manowar is really about , it would be the first <NUM> cd 's , because they truly are a great period for the band . during that time period , information about manowar was hard to come by here in the united states ; the media ignored them , and the critics panned them , and neither had a just cause for doing so - manowar 's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage . joey demaio is still the most original bassist around , eric adams ' voice is simply unbelievable ( i 've studied voice for the last <NUM> years - trust me , the guy is incredible ) . scott columbus is simply my favorite drummer . i began playing drums well over <NUM> years ago , and john bonham was quickly replaced by scott columbus ; and we finally come to ross the boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that ross has . the first <NUM> releases were recorded in analog - that 's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound , the band began utilizing digital recording equipment for the following releases . for me , this cd was the end of an era , because manowar 's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw , and it was n't until they released triumph of steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late <NUM> 's seemed to kill . that said , i would highly recommend this cd to anyone wanting to get a taste of what manowar was really about .
he loves his eric carle books , so when is aw this dvd i had to buy it , and it is a success ! my son ( <NUM> 1/2 ) wants to watch it every night . we watch it together before bedtime . he loves it ! !
i was comparing this season with similar dvd 's that were in the same years , even much later , and i must say these dvd transfers are top notch . hard to believe this show is <NUM> years old . the color and sound came out great . no one should be complaining about the quality of the transfers , a
`` one wild night : live 1985-2001 '' by bon jovi , is a compilation of bon jovi 's best songs , performed at various concert events from <NUM> to <NUM> . for bon jovi fans , it 's classic bob jovi and a must have ! if you like music recorded from `` live '' performances , you will love this album ! if you prefer `` studio-cut '' versions , you may not like this album because it has the sound and feel of a live concert .
`` sonya has done it again ! ! sonya hamlin , the communicator 's communicator , tells everyone what she has long taught the pros . written in clear format and style that itself makes her point , sonya hamlin talks to us . as we read , we smile , we scribble notes , and , boy , do we learn , even those who thought they already knew . insightful , wise , intensely practical , unfailingly on target and a joy to read . bravo ! a must read for anyone who works and must therefore talk .

no other movie has ever become such a booming sense of reality to my life than the evil dead movie/s .. bruce campbell is one if not my favourite actor and enjoy all his movies .. this edition is great for the commentaries on it and the extra features including bruce 's little doco on fans ... a must have for all fans ! ! ! ! i am scared they are thinking of remaking this fantastic movie and i just hope mr. rami will realize this is a mistake ... 'ash ' rules ! !
the packaging of the dvd with the readymades lp makes for a perfect match . the original album was very strong , the dvd is very entertaining . recommended for the chumbawamba fan
this book is very good for the beginner . but no unix book can teach everything . that 's why i found it better to also buy the unix essentials dvd . it 's way better when you have both . and it only costs $ 5,325.99 . you need these dvds . you really do ! hee hee ! just kidding . but i really am sick of all those fake reviews that advertise these over-priced dvds
granted , it is obvious that the guitar work here , is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there . but as always , winters vocals range from the grating , to the almost comical charactures , they devolved into later ( and not much later at that ) , in his career . the guitar work deserves <NUM> stars , minus <NUM> for the vocals = <NUM>
most music i listen to would n't sound anything like this . my idea of a good time is listening to mogwai at full volume or bumping hip hop with a lot of bass . of montreal are incredible . the bass lines are ridiculously funky . i did n't think i liked this cd as much as their other work , but after listening to it <NUM> times i ca n't get it out of my head . i usually prefer lyrics that are n't as literal as this , but it works really well . there 's so many good songs 'but which one do i , do i cho-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose ' . really , i do n't know what the best song is , because all of the songs are either a 9-10 . 'gronladic edit ' is nothing short of brilliant . the transistion from tracks <NUM> and <NUM> is one of my favorite moments . handclaps cheesy ? i think not ! this music puts me in a really good mood . and it 's psychedelic in the best way possible . it 's like listening to i do n't know , the cars/beach boys/zappa/beatles/dust brothers at the same time .
be sure to look for the newer edition ( <NUM> ) as it covers <NUM> small towns . i started out thinking i would just dip into this , and read a few pages here and there . then it turned out to be so interesting with florida history , local tidbits , interesting people and architecture , that i read it straight through . now i ca n't wait to visit havana to see the antique shops or to see the <NUM> murals in lake placid . some of the towns merely have interesting names ( yeehaw junction ) or a single sight , but many sound worthwhile for a day trip or longer visit . probably should keep this book in the car while in florida and check it occasionally to see if you are near any of these interesting places . it is arranged by regions ( north , central and south )
i loved reading this book and it was so much more fun to study sat vocab words this way than by using flashcards . i told my friends about it so they could use it too . there are so many sat words in the book and it 's fun and easy to learn them
throughout the reviews for `` bone machine '' , you 'll see warnings that this music is harrowing , obsessed with death , `` not the place to begin with tom waits . '' pshaw . this album makes me grin ear-to-ear , all the way through . this one contains some of tom 's most lovely ballads : `` who are you '' , and the amazing `` a little rain '' . it has some of his funniest lyrics : `` murder in the red barn '' comes to mind . `` cause there 's nothin ' strange about an axe with bloodstains in the barn there 's always some killin' you got to do around the farm '' the poetry on `` bone machine '' is truly ( to use an overused phrase ) , mind-blowing . hell , i might even go to church if they sang honest songs about mortality like the chillingly beautiful `` dirt in the ground '' ! `` the ocean does n't want me '' is his best spoken word piece ever . `` jesus gon na be here '' just flat rocks out . be clear about this : `` bone machine '' is not background music : it demands attention . but the bottom line : be not afraid . strap on the headphones , pour a tall glass , and take the ride .
when i decided to try yoga this was the first dvd that i purchased . it is fantastic . i have since bought another <NUM> of ravi & ana 's dvds , and several done by other people . the other choices do not come anywhere near the standard and style of ravi & ana . thank you to them for making my discovery of yoga a true pleasure
this is that typical kind of entertaining 1950s adventure film for all the family , of the kind `` they do n't make anymore '' . so if you liked `` elephant walk '' ( <NUM> ) or `` king solomon 's mines '' ( <NUM> ) , this one 's most definitely for you ! what stands out , imo , besides the special effects ( good for <NUM> ) and scenes dealing the marabunta invasion , is the great chemistry between sultry , elegant , appealing eleanor parker ( joanna leiningen ) , at her prettiest and most ladylike , but at the same time , full of passion , ardour and desire to love a real man ... and there he is , charlton heston ( leiningen ) , at the peak of his macho-man magnetism with the ladies ( my mother told me that she absolutelly swooned over him around the time he made this film ) . he conveys very well the character 's contradictions between his insecurities as man and his desire for this wondrous woman ( parker ) , chosen to be his wife by his brother . the first part of the film has plenty of scenes that fully display , elegantly in 1950s style , the sexual tension between the characters played by both leads . they make one of the handsomest couples ever paired . william conrad ( of `` jake and the fatman '' fame ) is good as the friendly comissioner . abraham sofaer plays a similar role than in `` elephant walk '' , but this time more sympathetic towards the heroine . some footage must have been filmed on location , but almost all of the scenes involving the leading players were obviously filmed in paramount 's backlot . good entertainment ! the dvd has no extras though . the print 's quality is very good !
this was one of my favorites when i was young and i ca n't wait to see it again ! plus it has that cool song in it `` who you gon na call ? ghostbusters !
as a great fan of the book , i was slightly apprehensieve about seeing the tv series . however , i really feel it does the book justice and brings the characters and india to life with its fantastic scenery and sumptuous costumes . amy irving is perfect as anjuli and although unsure at first of ben cross 's performance , i soon warmed to him as ash . the picture on the dvd was really good , as was the sound . a must see dvd for anyone who is interested in the history of india
this book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it 's not the party , it 's the man . by serving presidents from both parties , gergen forces republican and democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent presidential successes and failures . for example , i was a proud reagan youth who did n't vote for clinton in <NUM> however , by <NUM> i had to admit that clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party 's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country . gergen explains how clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country . gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by <NUM> about reagan , that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right , reagan was truly a president to all americans and governed from the middle . if are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party , this is a great case study . if you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people , this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach . if you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents , this is not the book for you
i never took a psychology course in my life , but one day , for some reason or another , i decided to take the ap psychology exam . i picked up this book , read it throughly and took the tests at the back . on test day , i was literally laughing because the test was exactly the material presented in the barron 's book . i breezed through effortlessly and got a <NUM> . i would like to extend my sincere thanks to the makers of this book- i can not tell you my appreciation , and i applaud your production of an outstanding review book . if you truly know every concept in this book , i can not , in anyway , foresee a score less than a 5. by the way , the tests at the back of the book are slightly more complicated than the real thing , so do n't be alarmed if you miss <NUM> or <NUM> ... keep in mind i was laughing on test day . thank you barron '
what an amazing dvd , not only the music is great the visual effects are extraordinary . a definite must buy
in these essays , solomon explores in more detail certain topics that he had only been able to touch on more generally in the earlier , full-fledged biography he had written of beethoven . ( he has since followed up more essays strictly on `` late beethoven . '' ) i find these essays thoughtful , probing , and lucid -- not least the fine essay on beethoven 's genuine but ambivalent quest for faith . -- frank burch brow
st . elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [ and at times wistful ] voice of cee-low and thought-provoking lyrics . i enjoy the variety of styles [ from the frentic `` go-go gospel '' to the introspective `` just a thought '' ] . a must-have purchase
this band was on the great hiphop group for the late 1980s . they pretty much did everything that was innovative fifteen years ago . public enemy and nwa got more attention at the time . they paved the way for other innovators like beastie boys and de la soul . ten years later they would influence the prodigy 's the fat of the land . kool keith would continue and make great records later . but this was back in the day of the fade haircut . that was the hype thing to do . each song on this record is a hit . `` ego trippin '' is some of the hardest hitting slamming music of all time . `` traveling at the speed of thought '' is an example how advanced they were lyrically . public enemy was more political and nwa was more gangster . ultramagnetic mcs were like poetry in a way that tupac shakar is n't . `` give the drummer some '' is one of their best songs . like public enemy , they were influenced by the beats of james brown . critical beatdown is one of the great albums of all time . it needs to be recognized . this album also contains six extra tracks like `` a chorus line . '' this is where things started . the 1980s were a harder time for hiphop to get known . this record reminds me of mike daley . we used to listen to hiphop and play video games .
i have to say that i prefer handel 's tamerlano for musical reasons . however , vivaldi 's opera on the same subject is very enjoyable and entertaining . like it has been said of the operas of haydn , vivaldi 's operas are not great operas , but they do contain great music . europa galante , directed from the 1st violin by fabio biondi , is in great form and i 've never heard them play better . i have their older recording of handel 's opera poro , and i enjoyed that one , too . the singers here are an excellent ensemble . i like the dark and expressive voice of ildebrando d'arcangelo - he was also marvellous as leporello in gardiner 's don giovanni . david daniels is fantastic , as usual , and he is possibly the best operatic countertenor in the world at the moment . patrizia ciofi is best heard and not seen - sweet voice coming from a madwoman ( check out the dvd ! ) . vivica genaux has been hyped to within a centimetre of her life recently . she has a nice flexible mezzo voice . a little too much vibrato for my tastes and she looks like a chipmunk when she attacks coloratura passages . marijana mijanovic sings well - she was excellent as the neurotic penelope in the christie / l.a.f . dvd of monteverdi 's il ritorno d'ulisse in patria . she is alarmingly thin - possible health problems ? she does n't engage with the conductor or orchestra at all in the dvd - the only singer who does n't . elina garanca looks beautiful ( and healthy ! ) and sings beautifully . she has a lovely contralto voice . i hope i see and hear more from this artist in the future . i am not a big fan of vivaldi 's operas - i enjoy them as collections of arias . i wonder how well bajazet worked on stage ? i 'd love to have a dvd of this production , i would like to see how a vivaldi opera works on stage . vivaldi 's operas do n't have imaginative scorings and the orchestral passages are fairly prosaic . a lot of what goes on in the vivaldi operas i 've heard ( i have a few in my cd collection ) is pretty routine . however , i am open minded on the subject and i would like to see how well a vivaldi opera works on stage .
the golden suns are here , finally ! this is an amazing set , and better than i remembered it as a kid ! compelling stories , good animation , great voice acting . tons of fun for any age . wish they made cartoons today as good as they did back in the `` day '' . the temple of the golden suns completely got me hooked on duck tales as a kid , and got me into reading the carl barks/don rosa comic books . i remembered it from , gosh , when i saw it in <NUM> ' , so it must have made a big impression ! go get it today - you wo n't be disappointed ! because life is like a hurricane
i write this review of `` the documentary '' as the game 's sophomore release `` doctor 's advocate '' prepares to be let loose on the populous . in january of <NUM> the game was let loose for the first time as he delivered his debut album `` the documentary '' on aftermath/g-unit records . it was a much hyped and much anticipated release . as it dropped universal praise was hefted upon the game for the record that was sonically spectacular and showed a revived west coast . lyrically some people hated on the game for name dropping so much , i wo n't lie sometimes it 's a little tiresome , but as an obsessive hip hop nerd i like to hear people rap about hip hop . its fun to figure out the connections they are trying to make and in all honesty it 's nice to know that at least one artist in this game actually knows his history and respects the architects of our culture . pretty quickly after the release it all started to fall apart . the game and his boss at g-unit , <NUM> cent , seemed to already be on shaky ground before the release , but upon the release it seemed everything was all good internally between the two camps with <NUM> 's hooks all over the album along with several guest verses and game 's screams of `` g-unit ! '' always keeping you aware of who was responsible for this project . then all of a sudden it seemed it came crashing down . game would n't ride with the unit on their beef with nas - he was out . we did n't really care because those of us who already had the record saw the talent that the kid had and we had `` the documentary '' to prove it . the record continued to grow and went on to sell an absurd amount of records . i got to say good on the game because listening to `` the documentary '' it 's obvious he put a lot of work into this album and that it meant a lot to him . he likes to talk about his life and what he 's been through to get to this point of releasing his debut record . he likes to praise his influences . but most of all he likes hip hop . so as i look back at `` the documentary '' almost <NUM> years later i ca n't help but feel what he 's saying . it 's the truth of that time in his life . sure game is cocky and seems confused and or lost with his life right now , but the one thing that he does know is hip hop and he knows how to write verses . if you do n't have `` the documentary '' you need this record if for no other reason to see a young man grow . without `` the documentary '' you will not understand `` doctor 's advocate '' ( which i 'll write a review for sooner than <NUM> years ! ) , the record that will prove he did grow up and does n't need anyone 's help , <NUM> or dre ( trust me i 've heard it ) . `` the documentary '' may not be a classic but it 's damn good and deserves a place in not just your hip hop collection but in your music collection as this is an album that goes beyond the definition of genre and is just music at its simplest form .
moonflower put santana back into the charts , and back into the major music mainstream . this is the first platinum album since santana iii in <NUM> . moonflower went on to sell ten million copies worlwide . the two preceding albums , amigos and festival , got santana out of the heavy jazz fusion genre , and back into more `` radio friendly '' afro-cuban rock , like the early days . a few hits came , e.g . dance sister dance , let it shine , let the children play , etc . but not until she 's not there did santana really crack the charts . the whole album is extremely good . all of the live tracks are superb . there is not a single weak spot on the album . the bonus tracks are extra . the album would be just as good , maybe even better if the bonus tracks were n't there . they are completely unnecessary , shortened versions of the original versions on the album . but you can just skip those . get the album
i started reading this wonderful book <NUM> months before i left brazil towards israel . after finishing the first part ( paradise ) i just could not keep on reading , and i abandoned the book for a while . after i landed in israel i re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it . a thought occurred to me that the reading was so descriptive of the immigration sentiment that i just could not understand it before immigrating myself . the book helped me to understand and to organize the infinite sensations that come with the leaving/arriving to another country . how the language affects the way we think and act , how sadness and happiness are mingled into one strange feeling , how we cope and forget without noticing , and how we urge to succeed and prove that we can be part of the new country . in addition , the book also brought to me new feelings and curiosities about my grandparents , whom also escaped from poland and russia in the late <NUM> 's . hoffman describes so well how the old traditions and languages influenced the new live of those who left their country because of prejudice and persecution ! one passage that i am specially fond of : `` no , i 'm no patriot , nor was i ever allowed to be . and yet , the country of my childhood lives within me with a primacy that is a form of love . ( ... ) all it has given me is the world , but that is enough . it has fed me language , perceptions , sounds , the human kind . it has given me the colors and the furrows of reality , my first loves . the absoluteness of those loves can never be recaptured : no geometry of the landscape , no haze in the air , will live in us as intensely as the landscapes that we saw as the first , and to which we gave ourselves wholly , without reservations . '' it reminds me of wordsworth when he writes about tintern abbey . a wonderful life-changing book .
there is no better way to get into the mindset of fellini than through his own words . this unassuming book is full of the director 's thoughts and motivations . from behind the scene anectdotes to descriptions of scenes never filmed this is an excellent place to start learning about the movie world 's best director ever
i really enjoyed this book.it was bound to be published , sooner or later.if the library of alexandria did not burn and collapse , society would have seen this kind of book much sooner.many rebels and magicians would have withered in the piazza 's stockades , for circulating such an explosive tome about nature.let it be published ! through christianity and islam and communism , these power structures have done nothing to promote world peace and caring for the environment.those institutions destroy the haptic pagan , who then becomes numb to the ways of nature and her earth-magick.scott cunningham has became a lightening rod for ridicule by the pudibund neo-right.the average wiccan today , was still wearing nappies , when scott passed away.he would be amazed and delighted by the growth of the old religion today . some potentially good wiccans of the <NUM> 's were stymied by drifting into the red army faction , malcolm x 's panthers and the kirshna-moonies.this is a great beginners book for all open-minded people , who want to channel their energies in a more positive way.when one destroys an aspect of nature , one destroys part of the whole cosmic-web , in which we all live on . wicca is not about devil-worshipping , or a gateway path into satantism.nor an idle trip into lotusland.the amusing hollywood b-flicks , hash-out alot of the wrong sterotypes about true wicca.latest being the ridiculously inaccurate , '' wicker-man '' movie.use this book as a primer , and then research for more advanced wiccan studies.-as jim morrison once said , '' you 're all a bunch of slaves ! `` .so , wiccans of the earth unite ! you have nothing to lose but your chains of ignorance !
i have hestitated to write a review on `` purple rain '' for years because <NUM> . i listened to this album for <NUM> years everyday ( 1984- <NUM> ) and never knew what it truly was . <NUM> . in many ways it has made the most profund change in me as a person . <NUM> . because underneath of it 's sexuality is the greatest christian rock album of all times <NUM> . and also the greatest musical statment of the rock era . in many ways prince and the revolution 's `` purple rain '' was the extension of the classic sly and the family lineup ( whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically ) and their second album together he leaves the minneapolis sound somewhat and instead of the punk/funk nu wave vibes of <NUM> he opts for power pop like the who and the kinks on songs like `` let go crazy '' is a classic clash of synth pop with townsend -like guitar chrouses but the lyrics start with him either in prayer in a thearpists chair with a traditonal gospel intro talking about the 'afterworld ' or insanity ( much like marvin gaye lyrically at his best ) and with those minneapolis synths of coleman and dr. fink swirling and vamping about , the song becomes power pop heaven for guitar freaks and the lyrics which captures lust , salvation and insanity with it 's perfect guitar solos and the end with it 's cathraic release siginals that we are not only listening to a soundtrack but at it 's core a christian rock album but it does n't sound like a newsboys , amy grant or dc talk album because unlike those groups , prince talks about the flesh in ways that these artists would never broach on an album . side one ( i have it on vinyl , cd and tape ) after the insanity of let 's go crazy is the great pop of take me with u with it 's great arrangement and while appolonia is vocally limited , she turns in a great performance on this song and prince being the great singer could have overwhelmed her vocally but he stays in her range `` the beautiful ones '' the only r & b sounding song on side one , is a beautiful declaration of love to his girlfriend at the time susanah melvion . in his best smokey robinson/curtis mayfield/eddie kendricks falsetto he pleads with great tenderness in verse `` if i told u baby if i was in love with u baby baby baby we could married would that cool in the last verses he demands she makes a chocie do u want him ? or do u want me cause i want u tell me baby do u want me ! ! ! ! i got ta know i got ta know computer blue is probaly the most song that is hendrix/funkadelic in spirit lyrically and in musical exceution with it 's wendy and lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into the most insane prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically with the lyric `` til i find the righteous one computer blue '' with the revolution jamming along prince plays some of the best solos i have ever him play with it 's eddie hazel - like first solo before the breakdown into a ernie isley-like second ( whom i think prince sounds like ) melodic solo til the insane ending with him screaming like a banshee then it fades into the most controvesial song on the whole album , `` darling nikki '' ( the reason there are parental advisory tags on every album ) is about a visit to a hotel to see a girl who was a 'sex fiend ' and a song that while quite tame for today still only gets played late at night because of the lyric mastrubastion . i always thought the guitars had a led zeppelin vibe at the time but as i have listened to more black alternative albums it sounds like funkadelic in it 's prime . side two ( i know i am still doing the vinyl thing ) is where you really see the spritual side come out from the opener 'when doves cry ' a musical and artistic acheivement with it 's lack of bassline the song sounds like a sexual peacan about a woman , but it is actually about hwo one dominates or gives up control in their interpersonal and romantic relationships with really cold and dark lyrics with the lament of `` this is what it sounds like when doves cry '' even when prince is not singing about sex it bleeds through the lyrics it really is a sad song in many ways but the guitar brillance keeps the song lite . `` i would die <NUM> u `` is a great pop/funk song about faith under the quise of sexuality of god as a woman , a man or something you ca n't even fathom . me and my friends could n't believe at the time prince was talking about god in all those mainfestions with the chrous `` i would die <NUM> u baby i 'm a star is actually the most classic minneapolis sounding song with those classic keyboard vamps with that chant `` doctor '' with dr. fink 's great keyborad solo and then the finale of `` purple rain `` in which he takes a marvin gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them in a godly realm it is lyrically a double endtree you can say he 's talk about himself as a woman 's savoiur but it can also be about the power of god into one 's life . after watching the movie and concert you realize years later that this album at it 's heart is a ode to god and sex like many of his classic albums but it is the greatest christian rock album of all time because unlike those christian rock bands , they are never in touch with the world they are always trying to run away from those issues in their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes unlike prince who like bob marley and marvin gaye embraced the scared with the profane and came out with a masterwork for the ages .
this cd is as cool as they come . simply smooth all the way through . i love every song here . if you are thinking about getting this cd , stop and go get it . you 'll love it . ta ta ..
not sure what everyone else is upset about . either you like collective soul or you do n't . i love this album . it 's not a new release in that it 's mostly unplugged music . it 's without all the bells and whistles and it 's still great . i think if you just like cs for their 'music ' you wo n't like this cd , but if you like them for who they are and their lyrics , it 's a great cd . if you want a compilation of greatest hits , try <NUM> year itch , if you want the grass roots , from the ground up is for you . imh
a rather melodramatic rewriting of a plot that could have been produced by tennessee williams . the black widow of a mother who only lives and marries to get a son and put her hands on a big agricultural - or so - estate will not hesitate to kill and then she brainwashes her own son into believing his father died in some kind of an accident . what happens when this son gets married and is expecting a child from his newly wed wife ? the attachment of the son to his mother is shown as perverse and leading to the rejection of the wife , of the mother of the baby to come . then it melodramatically develops into a new criminal affair and the son finds then the courage , in the name of his wife and child , to break off and go . there is something incestuous and insane in this mother and the film sounds sad and unhappy , in spite of the positive ending . a son , a man , a human being in general can not live as a human being if he or she rejects his or her parents utterly . this is hatred and hatred is nothing but the perversion of love and hatred makes love impossible . a man or woman who hates can not love anyone properly and rejects herself or himself out of society . hatred is psychotic and leads , sooner or later , to murder and death . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris <NUM> pantheon sorbonne
most of you guys for sure remember that day on july <NUM> when suddenly you turned on the tv and dozens of bands played all day long their best songs for a noble and humanitarian reason . when you buy this cd remember that you are helping to save human lives in africa , and that is worth much more than the wonderful songs that you will listen here . the best performance of all ? probably mick jagger 's give me just another night , the cars ' heartbeat city , david bowie 's heroes , queen we are the champions , u2 's ( birth to the world ) bad , tom pettys ' refugee or duran duran with hall & oates
it 's hard to begin to praise leigh montville 's biography of baseball 's greatest slugger ever . there 's a prelude written in a 'foggy , ' uncertain-of-detail prose style which deals with the young george herman ruth 's being committed to a 'boy 's school , 'and then drops into a dead-accurate lowdown which montville researched diligently , right down to the brothers and young 'nigger lips 's ' discovery of the game and his rapid mastery . montville tells true stories about the babe 's slugging , eating , drinking and sexual prowess in sometimes drop-deadpan humour , and he 's a hell of a sportswriter as well . three cheers for montville and the babe ! ! ! ( but hey , who hit a lifetime .371 ?
just the packaging alone makes this box set worthwhile . i 've never seen anything like it . the exterior is like a trapper keeper , slick plastic that 's kind of puffy and soft to the touch . it then folds out into four dvd trays and has a really well designed booklet , talking about the films and the genre ( sukeban ) . i just got my copy and everyone that 's been over and seen it has flipped out about the box , ` cause it just looks so cool ( and is so pink ) . the bonus cd of reiko ike singing is mounted in with the booklet and is weird and kind of a novelty . i put it on at a party a couple of weeks ago and people were way into it . the movies are cool too . `` criminal woman : killing melody '' is my favorite , but the end of `` delinquent girl boss : worthless to confess '' is amazing . there 's no way that quentin tarintino did n't see it before he made `` kill bill '' . i just read on the website of the company that put out the set ( panik house ) that they pre-sold 2/3 of the run of 10,000 and they think they 're going to sell out soon , so if you 're at all interested in getting a copy of this you should . now . it was totally worth the money
i purchased this novel nearly ten years ago . at the time of the purchase , i did not realize that it was a series . so , this book lay gathering dust on my bookshelf , until one day i completely ran out of novels to read . i picked it up , and i was captivated after the first few pages . i did n't want to start the book without reading the ones prior . fortunately , jonathan kellerman is a good enough writer to write a series that does not have to be read in order ! this novel-the clinic-is one of the most fast paced that i 've ever read . i could not put this book down for the life of me . i had to know the who 's , the when 's , why 's , and how 's that were so skillfully placed ! there are so many twists and turns to keep the reader interested , and so much information into the lives of the characters . i recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good novel , especially one that is just as much of a mystery as it is a suspenseful thriller
i bought this cd without ever having listened to a single note of the band 's work . i had read a review in sound and vision , then the views here at amazon , and i took a chance . i was not disappointed . every song here is an absolute gem . the harmonies are magical , and the instrumentation will transport you . i play this disk again and again , and i think my wife is going to hide the cd if i play it at dinnertime once more . i promise you will not be disappointed . buy this disk , and simply enjoy ; it 's magic , gorgeous , and worth any price
i first found out hannah montana when i realised i saw billy ray cyrus , thinking it was someone else at first . thank goodness i was wrong ! ! ! i am quite older than being <NUM> , ( almost <NUM> ) but i loved billy ray cyrus when he first came out in early <NUM> 's , and still do . now that his daughter miley has her own show and an awesome voice , i not only do i get to see and hear him again , but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has . i knew i had to buy the dvd , not question there . it 's a piece of my past , when i was a teen , but it 's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work . it tells me to be a kid at heart , and laugh every now and then ! !
laura brang died way to young only <NUM> i like her stuff my freind died from the same thing at <NUM>
compare the two albums by dave that get the most negative reviews , and it 's like heaven and hell . this is a mfing amazing album next to stand up . i really do n't understand the disillusionment by all these dave matthews fans over this cd . there are some pure golden songs on it , and like any other album , there are some not so great ones , but this at least still sounds like dmb . i never had any doubts about this cd until i started reading such negative reviews . i went back and listened a little more critically , and i still stand my initial impression . not his strongest , but still an acceptable album
with some great recent soundtracks from `` ladder <NUM> , '' `` the aviator '' & `` wicker park , '' i thought it would be great to revisit this classic soundtrack from <NUM> . `` practical magic '' holds up well <NUM> years after its release as a song collection . my favorite is nilsson 's `` coconut . '' it 's interesting that the producers use his first name since he always went by just his last name on his own releases . however , that track with `` put the lime in the coconut & drink it all up , call me in the morning & i 'll tell you what to do '' is just the classic feel good track . joni mitchell 's `` a case of you '' from her classic `` blue '' album sounds at home in this set , `` i 'm a lonely painter ; i live in a box of paints ; i 'm frightened by the devil & i 'm drawn to those ones that ai n't afraid . i remember that time you told me love is touching souls , surely you touched mine . '' joni marries such a unique melody with poetic lyrics that any set rises from her inclusion . stevie nicks ' two songs are both great inclusions from this enigmatic singer . `` crystal '' builds nicely with her soothing vocals , `` i turned around & the water was closing all around like a glove , like the love i finally found me . '' the opener `` if ever you did believe '' has a lovely melody that draws you in with repeated listenings . faith hill 's `` this kiss '' had to be about the catchiest country song of the 90s & is classic in any setting . marvin gaye 's track `` got to give it up ( pt . <NUM> ) '' has an infectious driving beat superimposed over party sounds . lisa hall is not an artist i know , but this track has good energy and drive . nick drake was one of my favorites when he was alive . his moody folk driven melodies touched a chord as does this track `` black eyed dog . '' `` practical magic '' is an excellent collection of music . enjoy !
i ca n't remember when i saw this one on the big screen . it was not long after easy rider and we had the idea that this jack nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70 's counter-culture . he did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting i had ever seen . he out-classed the james dean 's and marlon brando 's , but not with ease . jack was workin ' hard , switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood romeo in five-minute intervals . no , make that changeable temperament every five seconds , truly an artistic milestone . throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by karen black , sexy and hillbilly ; jessica simpson , eat your heart out , and you have the couple of the year , <NUM> . jack 's father is one of those evil patriarch 's that hurt their kids bad , pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love . consequently , the siblings are brilliant and eccentric . the daughter is a frumpy dope . the older son is a violinist with a neck injury , and then there 's handsome jack , shiftless , moving from bed to bed , crossing the country , a boozing bum . back in the vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life . did we have to get a job and get married ? was everyone in a particular cubbyhole , mail in the funeral ? hence , we had the counter-culture , drugs , long haired hippies , sexual openness , and shiftless lifestyles . bob rafelson 's film gives you that , but mercifully , with subtly . that last scene at the gas station says it all . i think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film 's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing .
good to see this finally released on dvd as i had worn out my vhs copy . one of the great music videos , this is a must have for all nirvana fans . the quality is not the best , but that being a result of the source equipment , not the video to dvd transfer . hopefully , this copy will last forever
i got this yesterday for christmas after hearing the song , `` you set me free '' used on the ice princess soundtrack , and i love it ! well , most of it . here 's my review of the spirit room . <NUM> . everywhere- 9/10- a fun and upbeat song . pretty good , love the intro to it . <NUM> . you get me- 5/10- it 's pretty , but just too slow to me . maybe it 'll grow on me eventually . <NUM> . all you wanted- 10/10- the best on the album . love it ! was this a single ? if not , it definalty should have been . <NUM> . you set me free- 10/10- like i already wrote , i got this cd after hearing this song on ice princess . really good and fun to sing to . <NUM> . something to sleep to- 7/10- ok. you should listen to it if you want to go to sleep . i still think it 's ok. <NUM> . here with me- 9/10- love the beginning and the chorus . it seems like a really good song for a party . <NUM> . sweet misery- 6/10- ok also . i just do n't really like how the chorus is and it 's too short . <NUM> . if only she knew- 10/10- fun and cool . one of my favorites . <NUM> . i 'd rather be in love- 7/10- sounds alot like sweet misery . <NUM> . goodbye to you- 8/10- this is a really pretty song about moving on in life . <NUM> . drop in the ocean- i do n't really get this song . i 'm not going to rate it . overall , this cd gets an a . it 's pretty good . i think you should buy it
has all the harry potters with their respective added materials , much cheaper than buying individually .
realize that no one said this is `` real '' . it 's a movie about the future people . that being said , i teach high school biology and environmental science and i find this to be an excellent and entertaining dvd series . i use it to reinforce principles like : plate tectonics , climate patterns , adaptation , desert formation , biomes , eusocial insect societies , and especially , evolution . i could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series . i have been using this series for <NUM> years now and i have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too `` fake '' . i have had many students ask if this is real , to which i have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals ca n't be real but the concepts are real . why is this applicable to teachers ? the dvds introduce fictional creaures , many of which are absolutely fantastic , and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on earth right now , just in different forms . so the series really is about present animals as much as future animals . i use it in high school , but it is just as useful for middle school . please , if you are a science teacher , you owe it to yourself to see these dvds . when you see how good a teaching tool they can be , you 'll want to purchase these ( or get your school media center to purchase them ! ) .
if you play this cd in reverse it says `` jesus is satan . '' comets on fire are dense . blue cathedral was a punishing wall of noise . listening to it i felt like one of those explorers in the black and white tarzan movies equipped with a machete inching through the foliage . however , once you carved out your own path the album rewarded you tenfold . comets are unapologetically classic rock , but instead of just breaking out the old hendrix and painting by numbers they added some proto-punk and an echoplex . some thought blue cathedral was more attitude than it was songwriting , and to them avatar is the perfect rebuttal . here the faces riffs and robert plant vocals are slowed down to further reveal the songs to the point where someone who hated blue cathedral might actually like avatar . do n't worry , there 's still use of the echoplex , and the songs are drawn from six to eight minutes in length ( with one exception ) , but comets have traded in some of their feral energy for a more dynamic sound . benefiting the most from the new dynamics is the bad acid sounding `` lucifer 's memory , '' a song that sounds like a flower wilting . there 's a certain cadence that plugs along with the chugging vocals pushing the song towards its seven minute mark . it has quickly become my favorite new song of this year . while there are still some rockers , such as the opener `` dogwood rust '' which sounds as if its beginning should be found somewhere before you pressed play , just as the closer sounds as if it ends before the song has stopped , even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors . only `` holy teeth '' has the same long-haired head banging attitude as blue cathedral , and it only lasts three minutes ( only a minute in comets on fire time ) . at almost nine-minutes `` soup smoke '' pushes the limits of pseudo-tribal beats . instead of punishing noise comets are pounding repetition into our heads . just thirteen more seconds and i think i would have had a spiritual vision . at only six minutes long the closer `` hatched upon the age '' proves that it takes more than just length to be epic and more than just noise for a crescendo . the miracle of the album is that through all of the interplay between the instruments sometimes it 's just a couple of simple repetitive piano keys to bring it all home . avatar is easily one of the best releases of '06 . very few bands can bring me back to that feeling i got discovering classic rock bands in middle school . but do n't break out your eight tracks and dust off the old bong yet . unlike most bands , retro is only half of the story for comets on fire . comets on fire are ultimately timeless . try as i might , i can not lump them with all the other seventies rockers , but their sound hardly seems contemporary . it 's as if they 've found some time wormhole so they can rock on across the ages . i 'm there , man , i 'm there
this is an illuminating glimpse into the music and song craft of the band . composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer john simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording `` the band '' . this one is for music lovers . many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio , with john simon , robbie robertson and levon helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix . absolutely fascinating stuff . having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past <NUM> years , it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated , with insightful commentary from the artists who created it . also fascinating , in more of a train wreck kind of a way , was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of garth hudson and rick danko . both brilliant artists , but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of the band 's fame . rick 's remarks on the loss of his best friend richard manuel left me with chills , knowing that not too many more months from this interview and rick would be gone from this place as well . well worth the bargain price , this will be one of those rare dvd 's that i actually return to again and again
this book is a brilliant expose of islamic fundamentalism and arab culture , showing its threat to western civilisation.a true wake-up call to all who think safety can be found in appeasement.brigitte gabriel 's credibilty is impeccable since she speaks as a christian arab who has experienced islamic terror and israeli democracy.she also gives the lie to the theory that israel is the root cause of international terror . brigitte gabriel is a brave beacon of light whom i salute as a truly righteous gentile

the corrections is the tale of the lambert family , a pretty standard late 20th century midwestern family . alfred lambert , the father , suffers from an array of old-age medical disorders . his wife , enid , lives in denial of his ( and her own ) problems and thrusts her frustration upon their now-grown children : chip , the failed academic turned new york screenwriter , denise , the sexually confused upscale cook in philadelphia and gary , the maritally frustrated investment banker in philly . the plot follows the three children 's lives as the fall apart , seemingly in sync with the collapse of alfred 's health . the story is driven by enid 's desire to have her three children return home for alfred 's `` last '' christmas . franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together , introducing fun moments of `` aha ! '' to the reader . recurring themes and motifs include mind altering drugs , the boom of the late 1990s , and the former soviet bloc . secondary characters connect primary characters together via seemingly random ( yet believable ) relationships . i found this novel an interesting read , but i had a hard time getting through it . the novel , at times , is horribly depressing . the relationships of gary , denise , and chip are painful to read , although maybe that 's what makes this novel so captivating at times - you can really identify with the characters . i think , at one point or another , we 've all been a gary , denise , chip or enid
this is high impact film ! for those who are interested in what happens after death , this film is very informative . it ties in well with the teachings of the buddhist way of life and shows why it is important to live a proper spiritual life . leonard cohen 's english rendition of the tibetan scripture is commendable . the visuals are engaging and in sync with the narration .

a simple movie that can be enjoyed by all ages . ( which is rare today ) the songs and great looks of elvis make this one enjoyable
this album sizzles with energy , honesty , and `` i 'll make you pay attention '' entertainment spirit . this was his big breakthrough album and it 's not hard to see why . every single track is excellent , and each very different from what went before . from start to finish , the emphasis is on simple beatleish rock arrangements , played with finesse by a great backing band , with the piano front and center . it starts off with plain rock and roll - moving out , with its thumpy rhythm and brilliant ending . the stranger ( apart from its stylish intro and outro ) is a bit more funky , with a lovely bridge/chorus . the much maligned just the way you are suffers from a bit of cheesiness in production ( billy joel calls this `` phil ramone 's bossa nova version ) , but is still a good heartfelt song for his first wife ( whatever happened to her anyways ? ) . the centrepiece of the album is scenes , this is billy joel 's tour-de-force to show everyone what he can do on the ivories . vienna is a beautiful ballad , and only the good die young is a hilarious dance tune , still racy <NUM> years later . always a woman is played a bit stiffly on piano , and borders on cheesy lyrics , but still a great tune . the next two tracks are a * bit * weaker , but have their moments and are still brilliant songs , just in comparison with what came before ... he came close to topping this album on glass houses but this still stands as his finest album . if you 're going to have just one of his albums , i would recommend this .
simply stunning score . the theme is possibly the most moving track you will come across in years . you can not hear it through without your eyes watering and every inch of your skin turns to goose flesh . by far james newton howard 's best score to date ; although his score for signs should be hard to top , he has done it
this revised version of the gelb 's famous biography from the sixties is an incredible read . it traces the life of o'neill from his early beginnings to his first broadway play , beyond the horizon . one gets an in-depth view of his life with his parents and brother . monte cristo provides the modern reader with an enriched biographical background that really elucidates aspects of o'neill 's masterwork , long day 's journey into night . this biography is clearly written , thoughtful , provocative , and interesting . it 's definitely one of the great literary biographies of an american writer
i 'm so glad that a friend recommended this book to me . it gave me a better understanding of what 's happening to my baby at various stages in his development , which sets my mind at ease . the book is well-written . it is divided by ages with a general description of how a baby behaves at that particular age and an explanation of what 's happening in the baby 's world and how it affects the baby 's mood in addition to his behavior
this is a very great chorus , and one of haydn 's best as far as i am concerned . the pace , grandness and spirit of the piece all conjure in one 's imagination the majesty of heaven , and god 's throne . i can not help but be moved to praise the god of the heavens and the earth . kanmi ogundip

definitely avalon in one of my top <NUM> albums ever ; this sacd version is amazing . i have listened to the remastered album thousand of times , but believe me , listening to the sacd album is another dimension and a whole new experience . all the sonic treatments , a roxy music trademark are just wow ! ! ! best regards to the fans , jose curiel from mexico cit
i have maybe a hundred christmas cds ( it 's a hobby ) but i think this is the only one with the `` explicit lyrics '' warning ! this is fore just for one song `` here comes fatty claus '' which featured a fairly prominent use of the `` sh * t '' word . i have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the cd without that song . she loves it ! as for the cd ... it 's pretty good . waters has managed to collect the best of campy christmas songs , something unique as far as i 'm aware . but it 's not just a novelty cd ... the songs are good . this is n't intentional camp ... it is sincere stuff with maybe the exception of the tiny time song . ( one of my daughter 's favorite , because it 's well done .
the variety of material available in 'the war of the jewels ' is what makes this volume of the history of middle-earth series one of the best . two things stand out . first is the extensive writings on hurin after his release from angband . in an extension and more fully recounted version of his tale , hurin 's character and the consequences of his release are more fully explored , giving greater depth to the account given in 'the silmarillion ' . the other is the essay 'quendi and eldar ' . this is a treasure-trove not only for the tolkien linguist but anyone interested in the history of the elves . through an examination of the different words used by the elves to refer to themselves and their different divisions , the look at their history as they themselves saw it is priceless . other parts of the essay and accompanying material fill out references found in 'unfinished tales ' , etc . 'the war of the jewels ' has many stories worth reading on their own that are great examples of the depth and the layers of the legendarium
anyone familiar with taebo and billy blanks knows that together equals pain and sweat . taebo is for people that understand you must sweat to burn fat and calories . this dvd helps you do just that . billy blanks has targeted in-directly on the problem areas once again . before i started using taebo as a workout strategy i was wore a size <NUM> . i am now a size <NUM> and even the <NUM> 's are loose . so i 'm very pleased with billy 's ab bootcamp dvd and all the others that i have . any of his cardio targeted dvd 's i will also highly recommend . billy 's ab bootcamp dvd is the absolute answer to a trimmer waist and stronger abs . it 's a way to have a six-pack even if you do n't drink . tjdelum in mphs , t
i first saw `` good neighbors '' ( 1975-77 ) in the late 1970s on pbs , shortly after the show was completed . i was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors , and the subtle comedy which did n't hit you over the head to make a point . when they came on the market in vhs format , i decided to buy them in installments , and am very happy i did . you likely know the story : richard briers plays tom good , a frustrated <NUM> year old draftsman who works for a plastics company . good and his wife barabara ( felicity kendall ) decide to `` get back to basics '' and thereby tom quits his job , turns the yard into a huge garden , buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient , bartering for only what they need , etc . not a practical life style for 1970s suburban london . contrasting are their neighbors : jerry and margo ledbetter , played by paul eddington and penelope keith . mr. ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company tom good used to work for ; he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job , which supports his expensive and well furnished home . ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity ; good does n't answer to a boss or schedule , but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock . the chemistry and comic timing between all <NUM> principal actors is very fine , and the laughs are many and frequent . despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment . i have n't seen the dvd version for comparison , but the vhs tapes are very good quality : clear picture , great camera work .
dan hedaya gives an oscar worthy performance
... says the mumbling milton ( my favorite character ) . the characters and their odd mannerisms made this film a success , in my view . one of my coworkers lent me this movie , promising me that i 'd like it - he was right . it is both funny and tragic , though a bit exaggerated ( but it 's a movie , where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic ) . most people can relate to office space , even if they do n't have a cubicle-based job . i happen to have a cubicle-based job , though i recently moved from a rather large cubicle to an office , which i share with another coworker ( there is a gray cubicle wall dividing it ) . it 's not so bad though . anyway , the main character , peter gibbons , lacks motivation in his career and is fed up with a number of business practices . but he does n't quit his job - he just stops working . doing nothing is his ideal life . the rap music is a nice touch . now back to my favorite character , milton , who repeatedly says that he `` could set the building on fire '' whenever things get too rough . he is pathetic yet likeable , and i felt sorry for him when he did n't get any cake at the party . everyone keeps passing it around , and he watches the cake get smaller and smaller until it is completely gone . and his desk is moved numerous times , which really irritates him . eventually , he moves down to the basement , where it is dark and lonely . his boss comes down to ask him to kill the cockroaches ( `` that would be terrific '' ) , even though it 's not milton 's job . his distinctive `` excuse me ... '' protests are rarely heard . he is being used by the company , no one respects him , no one listens to him . i 'd burn the building down too
this book really made me take a step back and look at my life and how i have wasted a lot of it with meaningless task that i do n't even enjoy . it teaches you to pay attention and devote your time to the things that really matter . i highly recommend this book for anyone who like myself leads a hurried life or feels like they have forgotten what brings them joy . buy this book !
listen to havona ! with jaco on the bass , probably one of his artworks of life ! truely inspiring and magnificent for any bassist who 's into funk , fusion , and jazz
the movie deals with an evil man known as rebi ra , who has summoned demons to help him conquer the world and destroy shinjuku , a part of tokyo with and earthquake . ten years later , the city is a demon-haunted wilderness when rebai attacks the world president
owning most of their output , this is my favorite , followed by `` mirror conspiracy '' and then `` cosmic game '' . re-mixed tunes from obscure ( to me ) artists segue into one another for over an hour 's musical world tour , thievery-style . their musical perspective explores the best elements of each choice , moving on at the perfect time to keep you interested and wanting more . unlike a lot of cds , this set stays strong towards the end ! stand outs : 'international flight' 'sea groove' 'cramp your style' 're-return of the original artform' 'expo in tokyo' 'my french brother' super-nice artwork and cover treatments . take this to a party only if you never want to see it again
the pace was a little slow to beginn but picked up.i could n't put the book down once it picked up and read it in <NUM> day.seems everybody got wet at some point and time and the banter was out loud funny and shocking.but when will we stop the short stories and get another book on sam and alyssa thats what i hungery for.to pass the time this will do , pull out the past books on troubleshooters inc to keep up with whos whos

i am currently watching some of the episodes of this season , but if you watch the entire opening sequence of the dvd before selecting from episodes , play , etc , they give away the twist endings for a few of the episodes . for season <NUM> & <NUM> , please wb , put back the crypt keeper where you can select an episode
this book is one of the best gifts i have ever recieved . i just moved into my first apartment , and was feeling really overwhelmed about getting organized and making the most of a very small space . this book has so many great organizational ideas that it actually made me excited to get started . it was a huge project , but thanks largely to this book , i feel really great about my new home and i honestly have never felt more organized -- such a great feeling ! ! ! thank you so much for all of the great ideas and tips ! ! !
love , love , love the book . reading his recipes has changed me from an `` adventurous cook '' to a truly great one . thanks mr. bittman . but about that binding ... my copy is now a <NUM> volume edition . i am sick of digging though all of the loose pages to find the recipes that i want . after i take the book from the shelf , there are always a number of pages that did n't travel with the cover . ugh . i have no idea how to fix this . i 'm here for another copy . * sheepish grin
usually i 'm not the greatest gloria estefan fan , but this cd utterly won me over ! i 'm not a super english gloria estefan fan , but her spanish cd 's have captivated my heart . when i decided to buy this cd , i was waiting for your typical dance music . i was really glad to hear good spanish music because now a days we lack that . every time i hear it ( whether i 'm doing homework , easy listening , or reading ) i want to be cuban ( de la patria ) and dance salsa forever ! she moves me-if not her , then definitely her music/orchestra . beautifully arranged , perfect timing , and a glorious attack of cuban beat/rhythm/love/spice/energy ! ! ! after this cd , i bought all her other spanish cd 's immediately ( like mi tierra and abriendo puertas ) but nonetheless , this cd ( alma caribena ) beats them all ! :
i wo n't leave a long review but i felt i had to write something in support of this album . as you all know , the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it . the <NUM> 's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene . i was born in <NUM> . i do n't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves . in a world that 's pumping out cr @ p music . it 's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry is n't totaly going down the toilet . a quick rundown : -best song is # <NUM> -excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 -song # <NUM> and # <NUM> are still ok -songs 3,5,7 are just average . overall the album has excellent flow , ie . the hit songs are n't the first on the album . -rivals nin 's downward spiral . without a doubt the best or second best nin album . i hope nin will continue . we need to purchase albums like this to show trent r. that we appreciate his work . ps . keep a look out for the new tool cd out in a few days . i 've heard it ( do n't ask ) and it is their best ever ! a must buy . -r
this book , originally published in <NUM> , contains floorplans and elevations of several dozen victorian houses . some plans are possibly suitable for actual construction . as the accurate title implies there are many drawings of architectural details . all plans are drawn to scale , but have been reduced by <NUM> % . this book is a must-have for fans of victorian architecture or home builders that are looking for victorian-style idea
i 'm a beginner reader and this book was very easy to read and i 'm not saying that it is boring in fact its descriptions are very suggestive , the narrative is very very astonishing and the end of the story could n't be more elegant
i have studied some greek and the original texts , and i must say many modern bibles are corrupting the word of god , no only in the unliteral translations but faulty originals they use . the king james version is faithful , both in being literal and using authentic texts . the new king james version is faithful in this attempt , the only changes being bringing the bible into more modern , but still respectful , english , and a few clarifications of words which have changed their meanings . i recommend it to all christians
i do n't recommend this book to the mosquito lovers of the world . if you 've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends , you probably should n't peruse this particular book . however . if you happen to enjoy a good `` why '' story from africa , you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated `` why mosquitoes buzz in people 's ears '' . in a kind of chicken little series of events , a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending , ultimately , in the sun no longer rising . when the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun 's disappearance , they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame . ever since , mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not `` everyone '' is still angry at them . the answer is a satisfying ( i love this descriptive sound ) kpao ! the illustrations are splendid . during the day they are set against a white background . by the time the sun disappears , they pop out of a black setting . kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene . it 's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme `` the house the jack built '' . and who knew that the sound lions make when they laugh is `` nge nge nge '' ? not i , said the fly . a lovely read
if that slow , plodding ric burns series on pbs was the official history of new york city , & quot ; you must remember this & quot ; is the indispensible people 's history : actual voices from the turn of the century ( the last century ) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant lower east side , the hell 's kitchen waterfront , jazz-era harlem , the last stretches of rural inwood . with this and & quot ; the box , & quot ; kisseloff is hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian i 've read , and yes , that 's counting studs terkel . buy one for yourself , and one for a history-lovin ' friend
gawd , i hope this is n't a forgotten recording . this is oregon at their early best : unselfconsciousness ; innocence ; no formula , no regard for sales - just love of musical communication on the most intimate scale . they understood the value of silence and patience . and witchi-tai to alone is worth buying this recording for - it , like precious few recordings , brings tears to my eyes and makes me glad to be alive and have ears
dziga vertov 's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema ( i say this with some reservations -- see below ) . the viewer is quite literally transported to the soviet union of the past . we witness love and loss , happiness and sadness , life and death . we witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day , a wedding and a divorce , a birth and a funeral . all the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth , the funeral a real funeral , the divorce a real divorce . nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people . the music is quite inventive and amazing , especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it . the editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of soviet silent cinema . that said , there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity , that those who follow the party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible . so many people are shocked by nazi propaganda films such as `` triumph of the will , '' -- i find it sad that more people are not troubled by soviet era films which tout the beauty of marxist-leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide ( i.e . the ukranians ) carried out by the soviets for over seventy years . the fact of the matter is that soviet marxist-leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others . this is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking
this soundtrack is a mix . my favorite songs are some of the prototype <NUM> 's tracks : danger zone , mighty wings , & through the fire . but it also has some great oldies like dock of the bay & great balls of fire . if you have n't seen this movie yet then go out and rent it . then pick up a copy of the soundtrack
as you already no larry the cable guys is an awesome comedian . so putting him in a movie s a brilliant idea ! this movie is so funny ! ! ! one of the best comedies ive ever see
it 's bands like these that make the <NUM> 's shine.too bad they did'nt make more releases.what 's really sad is that a lot of rock stations do n't even play this.paul 's voice is very distinctive , also got his solo stuff.so if you get the oppurtunity buy this and any of paul 's cd's.this is elite compared to the likes of kickaxe and black n blue.all in commin with great hard rock and songs that have hooks all over.and to mention they all did'nt make it big , what a shame !
this book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation . the author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in new york 's ghettos . the fierce images of rat-infested homes , and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions . kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children 's point of view to the political views of the country . also presenting an array of diverse issues such as aids , drugs , underage prostitution , death , motives based in moral , religious beliefs , and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader . feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area ; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood . numerous quotes and examples are given in the book , but one that particularly struck me was when kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds , `` not many ... well , to tell the truth , not any who are happy for more than one day ... no ! not for one day . for <NUM> minutes ... not any . that 's no lie '' ( <NUM> ) . to honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and i 'm sure for many others as well . by using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy . our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support . examples such as unsanitary hospitals , toxic incinerators , closet sized school rooms , and shabby , less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government 's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people . but once again kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial . he provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives . it seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets . while reading , it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true ; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction , though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were . taking into account the brilliant components of the book , i must say that i was vexed by one minor detail ; kozol 's overall presentation of his opinions . the beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject . but towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions . i feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses . other than this minor dislike i think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in new york . it may not be a thriller , or adventure novel , but it most certainly is a mystery . a mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope . kozol 's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so .
loved the movie but i thought i was buying both of the movies in dvd and this one came in vhs . the sequel to lcsoftly came in dvd form but i was disappointed that lcs did not
to me , this is rancid 's best work . i do n't understand why people say it 's `` rough around the edges '' , and crap like that ! this is punk people ! anyways , every song is fast , and catchy - which to me makes it a classic . this album kicks off with `` adina '' , ( one of the best songs on this cd ) which is a fast short song , with awesome guitar riffs . and after you hear that song ... you definetely will wan na listen to the next - trust me . and the next song `` hyena '' , is another one of the best songs , and an awesome chorus that 's all yelling ... every song has it 's own thing that makes it good . one of the slower songs , has got to be `` outta my mind '' . tim 's singing is what makes this song a classic ( to me ) . tim 's guitar work , bret 's drumming , and matt 's bass playing are at their best on this album . so if you 're new to rancid , i would highly recommend this . if not this , `` let 's go '' is another good one .
i want my children to remember what happened on that horrible day ; this dvd will greatly help . the events of september 11th are well documented from beginning to end . i especially liked the fact that cnn did not try to politicize anything -- they just told the story based on the facts . well worth the price
i use this video as an adjunct to taking classes in both tribal and cabaret styles . the warm-up is thorough and the explanations throughout the dvd are helpful . the break-up of the choreography allows you to personalize your session goals . i have been studying bellydance for a little over a year and this dvd helps solidify the foundations and also provides enough of a challenge to keep me coming back
boyz ii men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic motown groups ( temps and tops ) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings . this album broke them into superstardom as their followup to `` cooleyhighharmony '' , placing <NUM> songs into the charts for the philadelphia group . highlights : this album pretty much divides into <NUM> 'sides ' : the uptempo side ( before `` khalil '' ) and the ballads afterwards . most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half . part <NUM> has `` thank you '' ( the only up-tempo chart hit ) , an infectious number riding a doug e. fresh sample . `` vibin ' '' is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric 's pretty lightweight ( we 're just vibin'/dancin ' the night away/groovin'/vibin'/non-stop until the break of day ) . `` i sit away '' is a tony rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin . ( this and `` nobody knows '' .. is rich clinically depressed or what ? ) in the `` slow side '' , babyface 's `` i 'll make love to you '' set a record for the length of time at # <NUM> . `` on bended knee '' ( from jimmy jam and terry lewis ) and `` water runs dry '' ( another babyface composition ) also made some chart action . the group shows off their sterling harmonies on the beatles classic `` yesterday '' and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic . it 's a wonderful rendition . lows : `` all around the world '' is boyz ii men 's rewrite of ricky nelson 's `` travelin ' man '' more or less , but not nearly as memorable . considering how pivotal it is to the album , `` khalil '' is a pretty blah track . `` jezzebel '' is a dull overlong affair . `` <NUM> candles '' includes the lyric `` holding your body like a plastic molding '' .... 'nuff said . bottom line : there are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself , but the extras like `` i sit by '' and `` yesterday '' make this one worth owning . recommended for r & b fans
