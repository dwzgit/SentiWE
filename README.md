# SentiWE (cross-lingual word embedding mappings)
This is an open source implementation of our framework to learn cross-lingual word embedding mappings. 
The package includes a script to build cross-lingual word embeddings as described in the papers, as well as evaluation tools in word similarity/relatedness and cross-lingual sentiment analysis.
# Requirements
* Python 3
* Numpy
* SciPy
* CuPy (optional, only required for CUDA support)
